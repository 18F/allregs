The number should consist of at least four numerals enclosed in square brackets, including leading zeros (e.g., [0001]). The numbers and enclosing brackets should appear to the right of the left margin as the first item in each paragraph, before the first word of the paragraph, and should be highlighted in bold. A gap, equivalent to approximately four spaces, should follow the number. Nontext elements (e.g., tables, mathematical or chemical formulae, chemical structures, and sequence data) are considered part of the numbered paragraph around or above the elements, and should not be independently numbered. If a nontext element extends to the left margin, it should not be numbered as a separate and independent paragraph. A list is also treated as part of the paragraph around or above the list, and should not be independently numbered. Paragraph or section headers (titles), whether abutting the left margin or centered on the page, are not considered paragraphs and should not be numbered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interlineation, erasure, cancellation, or other alteration of the application papers may be made before or after the signing of the inventor's oath or declaration referring to those application papers, provided that the statements in the inventor's oath or declaration pursuant to Sec.  1.63 remain applicable to those application papers.

If a nonprovisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) is filed in a language other than English, an English language translation of the non-English language application, a statement that the translation is accurate, and the processing fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(i) are required. If these items are not filed with the application, the applicant will be notified and given a period of time within which they must be filed in order to avoid abandonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisional application. If a provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(b) is filed in a language other than English, an English language translation of the non-English language provisional application will not be required in the provisional application. See Sec.  1.78(a) for the requirements for claiming the benefit of such provisional application in a nonprovisional application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Electronic documents that are to become part of the permanent United States Patent and Trademark Office records in the file of a patent application, or reexamination or supplemental examination proceeding. (1) The following documents may be submitted to the Office on a compact disc in compliance with this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following documents may be submitted to the Office on a compact disc in compliance with this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A computer program listing (see Sec.  1.96);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A ``Sequence Listing'' (submitted under Sec.  1.821(c)); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any individual table (see Sec.  1.58) if the table is more than 50 pages in length, or if the total number of pages of all the tables in an application exceeds 100 pages in length, where a table page is a page printed on paper in conformance with paragraph (b) of this section and Sec.  1.58(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A compact disc as used in this part means a Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) or a Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R) in compliance with this paragraph. A CD-ROM is a ``read-only'' medium on which the data is pressed into the disc so that it cannot be changed or erased. A CD-R is a ``write once'' medium on which once the data is recorded, it is permanent and cannot be changed or erased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Each compact disc must conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9660 standard, and the contents of each compact disc must be in compliance with the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each compact disc must conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9660 standard, and the contents of each compact disc must be in compliance with the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each compact disc must be enclosed in a hard compact disc case within an unsealed padded and protective mailing envelope and accompanied by a transmittal letter on paper in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The transmittal letter must list for each compact disc the machine format (e.g., IBM-PC, Macintosh), the operating system compatibility (e.g., MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, Unix), a list of files contained on the compact disc including their names, sizes in bytes, and dates of creation, plus any other special information that is necessary to identify, maintain, and interpret (e.g., tables in landscape orientation should be identified as landscape orientation or be identified when inquired about) the information on the compact disc. Compact discs submitted to the Office will not be returned to the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any compact disc must be submitted in duplicate unless it contains only the ``Sequence Listing'' in computer readable form required by Sec.  1.821(e). The compact disc and duplicate copy must be labeled ``Copy 1'' and ``Copy 2,'' respectively. The transmittal letter which accompanies the compact disc must include a statement that the two compact discs are identical. In the event that the two compact discs are not identical, the Office will use the compact disc labeled ``Copy 1'' for further processing. Any amendment to the information on a compact disc must be by way of a replacement compact disc in compliance with this paragraph containing the substitute information, and must be accompanied by a statement that the replacement compact disc contains no new matter. The compact disc and copy must be labeled ``COPY 1 REPLACEMENT MM/DD/YYYY'' (with the month, day and year of creation indicated), and ``COPY 2 REPLACEMENT MM/DD/YYYY,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The specification must contain an incorporation-by-reference of the material on the compact disc in a separate paragraph (Sec.  1.77(b)(5)), identifying each compact disc by the names of the files contained on each of the compact discs, their date of creation and their sizes in bytes. The Office may require applicant to amend the specification to include in the paper portion any part of the specification previously submitted on compact disc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A compact disc must also be labeled with the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of each inventor (if known);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Title of the invention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The docket number, or application number if known, used by the person filing the application to identify the application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A creation date of the compact disc;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If multiple compact discs are submitted, the label shall indicate their order (e.g., ``1 of X''); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An indication that the disc is ``Copy 1'' or ``Copy 2'' of the submission. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a file is unreadable on both copies of the disc, the unreadable file will be treated as not having been submitted. A file is unreadable if, for example, it is of a format that does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, it is corrupted by a computer virus, or it is written onto a defective compact disc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> Any sequence listing in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.821(c) or (e), and any

computer program listing filed in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.96, will be excluded when determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s) or Sec.  1.492(j). For purposes of determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s) or Sec.  1.492(j), for an application the specification and drawings of which, excluding any sequence listing in compliance with Sec.  1.821(c) or (e), and any computer program listing filed in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.96, are submitted in whole or in part on an electronic medium other than the Office electronic filing system, each three kilobytes of content submitted on an electronic medium shall be counted as a sheet of paper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any sequence listing in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.821(c) or (e), and any

computer program listing filed in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.96, will be excluded when determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s) or Sec.  1.492(j). For purposes of determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s) or Sec.  1.492(j), for an application the specification and drawings of which, excluding any sequence listing in compliance with Sec.  1.821(c) or (e), and any computer program listing filed in an electronic medium in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.52(e) and 1.96, are submitted in whole or in part on an electronic medium other than the Office electronic filing system, each three kilobytes of content submitted on an electronic medium shall be counted as a sheet of paper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the paper size equivalent of the specification and drawings of an application submitted via the Office electronic filing system will be considered to be seventy-five percent of the number of sheets of paper present in the specification and drawings of the application when entered into the Office file wrapper after being rendered by the Office electronic filing system for purposes of determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s). Any sequence listing in compliance with Sec.  1.821(c) or (e), and any computer program listing in compliance with Sec.  1.96, submitted via the Office electronic filing system will be excluded when determining the application size fee required by Sec.  1.16(s) if the listing is submitted in ASCII text as part of an associated file.
