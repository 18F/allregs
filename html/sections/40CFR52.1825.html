Terms not defined below shall have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or EPA's regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Boiler operating day means a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in the EGU. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted for the entire 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the equipment required by this section to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes (using an automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS)), a permanent record of NOX emissions, other pollutant emissions, diluent, or stack gas volumetric flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NOX means nitrogen oxides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Owner/operator means any person who owns or who operates, controls, or supervises an EGU identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unit means any of the EGUs identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Emissions limitations. (1) The owners/operators subject to this section shall not emit or cause to be emitted NOX in excess of the following limitations, in pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu), averaged over a rolling 30-day period:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">NOX Emission limit (lb/</p><p class="depth0">Source name                            MMBtu)------------------------------------------------------------------------Coal Creek Station, Units 1 and 2.........  0.13, averaged across both</p><p class="depth0">units.Antelope Valley Station, Unit 1...........  0.17.Antelope Valley Station, Unit 2...........  0.17.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These emission limitations shall apply at all times, including startups, shutdowns, emergencies, and malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compliance date. The owners and operators of Coal Creek Station shall comply with the emissions limitation and other requirements of this section within five (5) years of the effective date of this rule, unless otherwise indicated in specific paragraphs. The owners and operators of Antelope Valley Station shall comply with the emissions limitations and other requirements of this section as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than July 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated in specific paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Compliance determination--(1) CEMS. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of

this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 75, to accurately measure NOX, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CEMS. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of

this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 75, to accurately measure NOX, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method. (i) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NOX concentration in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each boiler operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current boiler operating day and the previous 29 successive boiler operating days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NOX concentration in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each boiler operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current boiler operating day and the previous 29 successive boiler operating days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An hourly average NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by both the NOX pollutant concentration monitor and the diluent monitor (O2 or CO2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Data reported to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping. Owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All CEMS data, including the date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; parameters sampled or measured; and results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to, any records required by 40 CFR part 75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records of all major maintenance activities conducted on emission units, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any other records required by 40 CFR part 75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reporting. All reports under this section shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Environmental Justice, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8, Mail Code 8ENF-AT, 1595 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado 80202-1129.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Owner/operator shall submit quarterly excess emissions reports no later than the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter. Excess emissions means emissions that exceed the emissions limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The reports shall include the magnitude, date(s), and duration of each period of excess emissions, specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the unit, the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), and the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Owner/operator shall submit quarterly CEMS performance reports, to include dates and duration of each period during which the CEMS was inoperative (except for zero and span adjustments and calibration checks), reason(s) why the CEMS was inoperative and steps taken to prevent recurrence, any CEMS repairs or adjustments, and results of any CEMS performance tests required by 40 CFR part 75 (Relative Accuracy Test Audits, Relative Accuracy Audits, and Cylinder Gas Audits).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When no excess emissions have occurred or the CEMS has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted during the reporting period, such information shall be stated in the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notifications. (1) Owner/operator shall submit notification of commencement of construction of any equipment which is being constructed to comply with the NOX emission limits in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Owner/operator shall submit notification of commencement of construction of any equipment which is being constructed to comply with the NOX emission limits in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Owner/operator shall submit semi-annual progress reports on construction of any such equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Owner/operator shall submit notification of initial startup of any such equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equipment operation. At all times, owner/operator shall maintain each unit, including associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Credible Evidence. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with requirements of this section if the appropriate performance or compliance test procedures or method had been performed.
