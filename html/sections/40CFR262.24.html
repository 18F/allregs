                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em>, and used in accordance with this section in lieu of  EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A are   the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten  signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in these  regulations to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a  manifest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any requirement in these regulations to sign a manifest or  manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is  satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable  electronic signature within the meaning of 262.25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any requirement in these regulations to give, provide, send,  forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied  when an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by  submission to the system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any requirement in these regulations for a generator to keep or  retain a copy of each manifest is satisfied by retention of a signed  electronic manifest in the generator's account on the national e- Manifest system, provided that such copies are readily available for  viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state  inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No generator may be held liable for the inability to produce an  electronic manifest for inspection under this section if the generator  can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is  due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the electronic manifest  system for which the generator bears no responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A generator may participate in the electronic manifest system  either by accessing the electronic manifest system from its own  electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system  from portable equipment brought to the generator's site by the  transporter who accepts the hazardous waste shipment from the generator  for off-site transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restriction on use of electronic manifests. A generator may  prepare an electronic manifest for the tracking of hazardous waste  shipments involving any RCRA hazardous waste only if it is known at the  time the manifest is originated that all waste handlers named on the  manifest participate in the electronic manifest system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirement for one printed copy. To the extent the Hazardous  Materials regulation on shipping papers for carriage by public highway  requires shippers of hazardous materials to supply a paper document for  compliance with 49 CFR 177.817, a generator originating an electronic  manifest must also provide the initial transporter with one printed copy  of the electronic manifest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special procedures when electronic manifest is unavailable. If a  generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a hazardous waste  shipment, but the electronic manifest system becomes unavailable for any  reason prior to the time that the initial transporter has signed  electronically to acknowledge the receipt of the hazardous waste from  the generator, then the generator must obtain and complete a paper  manifest and if necessary, a continuation sheet (EPA Forms 8700-22 and  8700-22A) in accordance with the manifest instructions in the appendix  to this part, and use these paper forms from this point forward in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 262.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special procedures for electronic signature methods undergoing  tests. If a generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a  hazardous waste shipment, and signs this manifest electronically using  an electronic signature method which is undergoing pilot or  demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal  dependability of the signature method, then the generator shall also  sign with an ink signature the generator/offeror certification on the  printed copy of the manifest provided under paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Imposition of user fee. A generator who is a user of the  electronic manifest may be assessed a user fee by EPA for the  origination of each electronic manifest. EPA shall maintain and update  from time-to-time the current schedule of electronic manifest user fees,  which shall be determined based on current and projected system costs  and level of use of the electronic manifest system. The current schedule  of electronic manifest user fees shall be published as an appendix to  this part.  [79 FR 7558, Feb. 7, 2014]</p>
