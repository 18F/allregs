Sec. 301.9001-1  Collection of fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of fee--(1) In general. Under section 302(d) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (Act), the Internal Revenue Service is authorized to collect a fee of not more than 3 cents per barrel on oil that is obtained from the Outer Continental Shelf. This fee is established by the Commandant, United States Coast Guard, and is imposed on the owner of the oil as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The barrels subject to the fee shall be those barrels reported by the owner of the oil (Sec. 301.9001-1 (a)(2)), or a person authorized to act for the owner, on the monthly royalty reports, Form 9-153, filed with the U.S. Geological Survey as required by 30 CFR 250.94. For the purpose of computing this fee, the owner of the oil shall measure the Outer Continental Shelf oil production by employing the criteria of the U.S. Geological Survey contained in 30 CFR 250.60 and Outer Continental Shelf Gulf of Mexico Order 13. No reduction in the amount due will be permitted by reason of theoretical or actual oil lost in transit. To ensure that the Fund is maintained at a level of not less than $100,000,000 and not more than $200,000,000, the Commandant, United

States Coast Guard, may modify the amount of this fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Owner of oil. For the purposes of Sec. Sec. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3, the owner of oil is the person in whom is vested ownership of the oil as it is produced at the wellhead without regard to the existence of contractual arrangements for the sale or other disposition of the oil between such a person and third parties. Under this rule, the Federal government entitlement to royalty oil does not constitute ownership of oil by the Federal government at the time of production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X is the owner of oil produced on the Outer Continental Shelf. During one reporting period, 10,000 barrels of oil were obtained from this location. X will use a portion of this oil to make a royalty payment to the United States government. X also has a contract with Y to sell Y the remaining barrels of oil. For the purpose of the Act, X is the owner of the oil and must pay a fee of 3 cents per barrel on all 10,000 barrels of oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cross-references. See Sec. 301.9001-2(a) for the definition of barrel, Sec. 301.9001-2(b) for the definition of oil, and Sec. 301.9001-2(c) for the definition of person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective Date. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3 are effective on July 25, 1979, at 7:00 a.m., local time. If, however, the established practice has been to gauge oil production at a time other than 7:00 a.m., the effective date is July 25, 1979, at the time production has been gauged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Collection of fee. The Internal Revenue Service shall collect the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Act. Administrative procedures for the collection of this fee shall be prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may designate the reasonably necessary records and documents to be kept by the person or persons from whom the fee is collected. See also the regulations under 33 CFR 135.103 for additional rules relating to the implementation of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time and place for payment of the fee--(1) In general. Payment of the fee shall be made in accordance with the rules established in paragraph (c)(2), (3) and (4) of this section. When a deposit is required by these rules, it must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, Texas 73301 using Form 6008, Fee Deposit for Offshore Oil. Adjustments required in the amount paid during the calendar quarter to reflect the actual amount due for the quarter shall be made on Form 6009, Quarterly Report of Fees Due. Form 6009 must be filed on or before the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter with the Austin Service Center. The rules under section 7502, relating to the treatment of timely mailing as timely filing and paying, and section 7503, relating to the time for performance of acts where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday are applicable to the filing of Form 6009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $100 or less of fees. If the owner of oil is liable in any calendar quarter for $100 or less of fees, the owner or a person authorized to act for the owner may either deposit this amount or pay the full amount of the fee when Form 6009 is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than $100 of fees. If the owner of oil is liable in the first or second month of the calendar quarter for more than $100 of fees and is not required to make a semimonthly deposit (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section), the owner or a person authorized to act for the owner must deposit the amount on or before the last day of the following month following the month of production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> More than $2000 of fees. The owner of oil who is liable for more than $2000 of fees for any month of a calendar quarter must deposit fees for the following quarter (regardless of amount) on a semimonthly basis. The deposit must be made on or before the ninth day following the semimonthly period for which it is reportable. The first deposit for a month may be reasonably estimated when an accounting of oil production is normally done by the month. Under these circumstances, the second for that month deposit should be adjusted to reflect the total barrels produced in that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Responsibility for payment of fee--(1) In general. Form 6009, Quarterly Report of Fees Due, must be filed and the fee must be paid either by the owner of

the oil (Sec. 301.9001-1(a)(2)) or by a person authorized to act for the owner of the oil under an acceptable power of attorney filed with the Austin Service Center. For the purposes of the regulations at Sec. Sec. 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3, an operating agreement between the operator of the oil-producing facility and the owner of oil is considered an acceptable power of attorney if the operating agreement specifically states that the operator is authorized to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. W, X, Y, and Z are oil companies that own equal interests in oil produced on the Outer Continental Shelf. W was selected to be the operator of the offshore facility. Additionally, X, Y, and Z authorized W to file Form 6009 and to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Act on the oil produced at this facility. Pursuant to this authorization, W paid a fee of $16,600. Since the ownership of the oil is divided equally among W, X, Y, and Z, each company's share of the fee is $4,150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Penalty and Interest. Failure to collect or pay the fee shall result in a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amount of the penalty is not to exceed $10,000 in addition to the fee and the interest on the unpaid fee that would have been earned if paid when due and invested in the special Treasury securities which are to be purchased by the fund. The computation of the rate of interest to be levied on underpayment of fees shall be based on the average interest rate earned by the interest-bearing special obligations of the United States in the fund for each calendar quarter for which there is underpayment. Unless it can be shown that the failure to collect or pay the fee is due to reasonable cause and not due to the willful neglect, the amount of the penalty is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $10,000 or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the fee.

Sec. 301.9100-1  Extensions of time to make elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The regulations under this section and Sec. Sec. 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 provide the standards the Commissioner will use to determine whether to grant an extension of time to make a regulatory election. The regulations under this section and Sec. 301.9100-2 also provide an automatic extension of time to make certain statutory elections. An extension of time is available for elections that a taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make. However, the granting of an extension of time is not a determination that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. Section 301.9100-2 provides automatic extensions of time for making regulatory and statutory elections when the deadline for making the election is the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions. Section 301.9100-3 provides extensions of time for making regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 301.9100-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Terms. The following terms have the meanings provided below--</p><p class="depth0">Election includes an application for relief in respect of tax; a request to adopt, change, or retain an accounting method or accounting period; but does not include an application for an extension of time for filing a return under section 6081.</p><p class="depth0">Regulatory election means an election whose due date is prescribed by a regulation published in the Federal Register, or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">Statutory election means an election whose due date is prescribed by statute.</p><p class="depth0">Taxpayer means any person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General standards for relief. The Commissioner in exercising the Commissioner's discretion may grant a reasonable extension of time under the rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 to make a regulatory election, or a statutory election (but no more than 6 months except in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad), under all subtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, an extension of time will not be granted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For elections under section 4980A(f)(5); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For elections that are expressly excepted from relief or where alternative relief is provided by a statute, a regulation published in the Federal Register, or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective dates. In general, this section and Sec. Sec. 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 apply to all requests for an extension of time submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on or after December 31, 1997. However, the automatic 12-month and 6-month extensions provided in Sec. 301.9100-2 apply to elections for which corrective action is taken on or after December 31, 1997. For other requests for an extension of time, see Sec. Sec. 301.9100-1T through 301.9100-3T in effect prior to December 31, 1997

(Sec. Sec. 301.9100-1T through 301.9100-3T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1997).

Sec. 301.9100-2  Automatic extensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Automatic 12-month extension--(1) In general. An automatic extension of 12 months from the due date for making a regulatory election is granted to make elections described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section provided the taxpayer takes corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section within that 12-month extension period. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the due date for making a regulatory election is the extended due date of the return if the due date of the election is the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions and the taxpayer has obtained an extension of time to file the return. This extension is available regardless of whether the taxpayer timely filed its return for the year the election should have been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elections eligible for automatic 12-month extension. The following regulatory elections are eligible for the automatic 12-month extension described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The election to use other than the required taxable year under section 444;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The election to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method under section 472;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a section 501(c)(9), 501(c)(17), or 501(c)(20) organization under section 505;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a section 501(c)(3) organization under section 508;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The election to be treated as a homeowners association under section 528;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The election to adjust basis on partnership transfers and distributions under section 754;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The estate tax election to specially value qualified real property (where the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not yet begun an examination of the filed return) under section 2032A(d)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat a qualified payment right as other than a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(i); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat any distribution right as a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Automatic 6-month extension. An automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of a return excluding extensions is granted to make regulatory or statutory elections whose due dates are the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions provided the taxpayer timely filed its return for the year the election should have been made and the taxpayer takes corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section within that 6-month extension period. This paragraph (b) does not apply to regulatory or statutory elections that must be made by the due date of the return excluding extensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Corrective action. For purposes of this section, corrective action means taking the steps required to file the election in accordance with the statute or the regulation published in the Federal Register, or the revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). For those elections required to be filed with a return, corrective action includes filing an original or an amended return for the year the regulatory or statutory election should have been made and attaching the appropriate form or statement for making the election. Taxpayers who make an election under an automatic extension (and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election) must file their return in a manner that is consistent with the election and comply with all other requirements for making the election for the year the election should have been made and for all affected years; otherwise, the IRS may invalidate the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedural requirements. Any return, statement of election, or other form of filing that must be made to obtain an automatic extension must provide the following statement at the top of the document: ``FILED PURSUANT TO Sec. 301.9100-2''. Any filing made to obtain an automatic extension must be

sent to the same address that the filing to make the election would have been sent had the filing been timely made. No request for a letter ruling is required to obtain an automatic extension. Accordingly, user fees do not apply to taxpayers taking corrective action to obtain an automatic extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Automatic 12-month extension. Taxpayer A fails to make an election described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when filing A's 1997 income tax return on March 16, 1998, the due date of the return. This election does not affect the tax liability of any other taxpayer. The applicable regulation requires that the election be made by attaching the appropriate form to a timely filed return including extensions. In accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, A may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by March 15, 1999 (12 months from the March 16, 1998 due date of the return). If A obtained a 6-month extension to file its 1997 income tax return, A may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by September 15, 1999 (12 months from the September 15, 1998 extended due date of the return).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Automatic 6-month extension. Taxpayer B fails to make an election not described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when filing B's 1997 income tax return on March 16, 1998, the due date of the return. This election does not affect the tax liability of any other taxpayer. The applicable regulation requires that the election be made by attaching the appropriate form to a timely filed return including extensions. In accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, B may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by September 15, 1998 (6 months from the March 16, 1998 due date of the return).

Sec. 301.9100-3  Other extensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Requests for extensions of time for regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 301.9100-2 must be made under the rules of this section. Requests for relief subject to this section will be granted when the taxpayer provides the evidence (including affidavits described in paragraph (e) of this section) to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable action and good faith--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, a taxpayer is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requests relief under this section before the failure to make the regulatory election is discovered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failed to make the election because of intervening events beyond the taxpayer's control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failed to make the election because, after exercising reasonable diligence (taking into account the taxpayer's experience and the complexity of the return or issue), the taxpayer was unaware of the necessity for the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonably relied on the written advice of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, including a tax professional employed by the taxpayer, and the tax professional failed to make, or advise the taxpayer to make, the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable reliance on a qualified tax professional. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer will not be considered to have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the taxpayer knew or should have known that the professional was not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Competent to render advice on the regulatory election; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aware of all relevant facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayer deemed to have not acted reasonably or in good faith. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer is deemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662 at the time the taxpayer requests relief (taking into account any qualified amended return filed within the meaning of Sec. 1.6664-2(c)(3) of this chapter) and the new position requires or permits a regulatory election for which relief is requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Was informed in all material respects of the required election and related tax consequences, but chose not to file the election; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Uses hindsight in requesting relief. If specific facts have changed since the due date for making the election that make the election advantageous to a taxpayer, the IRS will not ordinarily grant relief. In such a case, the IRS will grant relief only when the taxpayer provides strong proof that the taxpayer's decision to seek relief did not involve hindsight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Prejudice to the interests of the Government--(1) In general. The Commissioner will grant a reasonable extension of time to make a regulatory election only when the interests of the Government will not be prejudiced by the granting of relief. This paragraph (c) provides the standards the Commissioner will use to determine when the interests of the Government are prejudiced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lower tax liability. The interests of the Government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in a taxpayer having a lower tax liability in the aggregate for all taxable years affected by the election than the taxpayer would have had if the election had been timely made (taking into account the time value of money). Similarly, if the tax consequences of more than one taxpayer are affected by the election, the Government's interests are prejudiced if extending the time for making the election may result in the affected taxpayers, in the aggregate, having a lower tax liability than if the election had been timely made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Closed years. The interests of the Government are ordinarily prejudiced if the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made or any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been timely made are closed by the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) before the taxpayer's receipt of a ruling granting relief under this section. The IRS may condition a grant of relief on the taxpayer providing the IRS with a statement from an independent auditor (other than an auditor providing an affidavit pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section) certifying that the interests of the Government are not prejudiced under the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for accounting method regulatory elections. The interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances if the accounting method regulatory election for which relief is requested--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is subject to the procedure described in Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(i) of this chapter (requiring the advance written consent of the Commissioner);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requires an adjustment under section 481(a) (or would require an adjustment under section 481(a) if the taxpayer changed to the method of accounting for which relief is requested in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year the election should have been made);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Would permit a change from an impermissible method of accounting that is an issue under consideration by examination, an appeals office, or a federal court and the change would provide a more favorable method or more favorable terms and conditions than if the change were made as part of an examination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provides a more favorable method of accounting or more favorable terms and conditions if the election is made by a certain date or taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules for accounting period regulatory elections. The interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances if an election is an accounting period regulatory election (other than the election to use other than the required taxable year under section 444) and the request for relief is filed more than 90 days after the due date for filing the Form 1128, Application to Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year (or other required statement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of amended returns--(1) Second examination under section 7605(b). Taxpayers requesting and receiving an extension of time under this section waive any objections to a second examination under section 7605(b) for the issue(s) that is the subject of the relief request and any correlative adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Suspension of the period of limitations under section 6501(a). A request for

relief under this section does not suspend the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a). Thus, for relief to be granted, the IRS may require the taxpayer to consent under section 6501(c)(4) to an extension of the period of limitations on assessment for the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made and any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been timely made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedural requirements--(1) In general. Requests for relief under this section must provide evidence that satisfies the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and must provide additional information as required by this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affidavit and declaration from taxpayer. The taxpayer, or the individual who acts on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to tax matters, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to make a valid regulatory election and to the discovery of the failure. When the taxpayer relied on a qualified tax professional for advice, the taxpayer's affidavit must describe the engagement and responsibilities of the professional as well as the extent to which the taxpayer relied on the professional. The affidavit must be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the taxpayer, which states: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this request, including accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the request contains all the relevant facts relating to the request, and such facts are true, correct, and complete.'' The individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances at issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Affidavits and declarations from other parties. The taxpayer must submit detailed affidavits from the individuals having knowledge or information about the events that led to the failure to make a valid regulatory election and to the discovery of the failure. These individuals must include the taxpayer's return preparer, any individual (including an employee of the taxpayer) who made a substantial contribution to the preparation of the return, and any accountant or attorney, knowledgeable in tax matters, who advised the taxpayer with regard to the election. An affidavit must describe the engagement and responsibilities of the individual as well as the advice that the individual provided to the taxpayer. Each affidavit must include the name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the individual, and be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the individual, which states: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this request, including accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the request contains all the relevant facts relating to the request, and such facts are true, correct, and complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other information. The request for relief filed under this section must also contain the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer must state whether the taxpayer's return(s) for the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made or any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been timely made is being examined by a district director, or is being considered by an appeals office or a federal court. The taxpayer must notify the IRS office considering the request for relief if the IRS starts an examination of any such return while the taxpayer's request for relief is pending;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer must state when the applicable return, form, or statement used to make the election was required to be filed and when it was actually filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer must submit a copy of any documents that refer to the election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When requested, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the taxpayer's return for any taxable year for which the taxpayer requests an extension of time to make the election and any return affected by the election; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When applicable, the taxpayer must submit a copy of the returns of other taxpayers affected by the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Filing instructions. A request for relief under this section is a request for a letter ruling. Requests for relief should be submitted in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests

for a letter ruling and must be accompanied by the applicable user fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer discovers own error. Taxpayer A prepares A's 1997 income tax return. A is unaware that a particular regulatory election is available to report a transaction in a particular manner. A files the 1997 return without making the election and reporting the transaction in a different manner. In 1999, A hires a qualified tax professional to prepare A's 1999 return. The professional discovers that A did not make the election. A promptly files for relief in accordance with this section. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, A is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because A requested relief before the failure to make the regulatory election was discovered by the IRS.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Reliance on qualified tax professional. Taxpayer B hires a qualified tax professional to advise B on preparing B's 1997 income tax return. The professional was competent to render advice on the election and B provided the professional with all the relevant facts. The professional fails to advise B that a regulatory election is necessary in order for B to report income on B's 1997 return in a particular manner. Nevertheless, B reports this income in a manner that is consistent with having made the election. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent discovers that the election has not been filed. B promptly files for relief in accordance with this section, including attaching an affidavit from B's professional stating that the professional failed to advise B that the election was necessary. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, B is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because B reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional and the tax professional failed to advise B to make the election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Accuracy-related penalty. Taxpayer C reports income on its 1997 income tax return in a manner that is contrary to a regulatory provision. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return, the IRS raises an issue regarding the reporting of this income on C's return and asserts the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662. C requests relief under this section to elect an alternative method of reporting the income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, C is deemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith because C seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty could be imposed under section 6662.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Election not requiring adjustment under section 481(a). Taxpayer D prepares D's 1997 income tax return. D is unaware that a particular accounting method regulatory election is available. D files D's 1997 return without making the election and uses another permissible method of accounting. The applicable regulation provides that the election is made on a cut-off basis (without an adjustment under section 481(a)). In 1998, D requests relief under this section to make the election under the regulation. If D were granted an extension of time to make the election, D would pay no less tax than if the election had been timely made. Assume that paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the interests of the Government are not deemed to be prejudiced because the election does not require an adjustment under section 481(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Election requiring adjustment under section 481(a). The facts are the same as in Example 4 of this paragraph (f) except that the applicable regulation provides that the election requires an adjustment under section 481(a). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual or compelling circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Under examination by the IRS. A regulation permits an automatic change in method of accounting for an item on a cut-off basis. Taxpayer E reports income on E's 1997 income tax return using an impermissible method of accounting for the item. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent notifies E in writing that its method of accounting for the item is an issue under consideration. Any change from the impermissible method made as part of an examination is made with an adjustment under section 481(a). E requests relief under this section to make the change pursuant to the regulation for 1997. The change on a cut-off basis under the regulation would be more favorable than if the change were made with an adjustment under section 481(a) as part of an examination. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances because E seeks to change from an impermissible method of accounting that is an issue under consideration in the examination on a basis that is more favorable than if the change were made as part of an examination.

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), the elections specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be made by the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The due date (taking extensions into account) of the income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is to be effective, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> April 15, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No extension of time for payment.

Elections under section 508(c) or 509 of the Act shall be made by the due date (taking extensions into account) of the income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is to be effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making elections. The elections specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be made by attaching a statement to the income tax return (or amended return) for the taxable year for which the election is made. Except as otherwise provided in the return or in the instructions accompanying the return for the taxable year, the statement shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the electing taxpayer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the election,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate the section of the Code (or, if the provision is not codified, the section of the Act) under which the election is being made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the period for which the election is being made and the property to which the election is to apply, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide any information required by the relevant statutory provisions and any information necessary to show that the taxpayer is entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designation of principal campaign committee. This paragraph applies to the designation of a principal campaign committee under section 527(h) of the Code, as added by section 128 of the Act. References in this section to ``elections'' include designations under section 527(h). Under that provision a candidate for Congress may designate one committee as the candidate's principal campaign committee. The political organization taxable income of that committee shall be taxed at the appropriate rates under section 11(b); that income is ordinarily taxed at the highest rate specified in section 11(b). The candidate shall designate the principal campaign committee by filing a statement of designation with the income tax return of the committee for the first taxable year of the committee ending after 1981 for which the designation is to be effective. The return and the statement shall be filed by the due date (taking extensions into account) of the return. The rules of section 21 (relating to effects of changes in rates

during a taxable year) shall apply in the case of any taxable year beginning before 1982 for which a designation is made. The statement of designation shall be signed by the candidate and shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the candidate and of the committee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the statement as a designation under section 527(h) of the Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Designate the committee as the principal campaign committee of the candidate.
The candidate shall attach to the statement a copy of the statement of designation filed with the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election to be treated as a qualified fund for purposes of the research credit. This paragraph applies to the election provided under section 44F(e)(4) of the Code, as added by section 221(a) of the Act. The election to be treated as a qualified fund for purposes of the research credit may be made effective as of any date after June 30, 1981, and before January 1, 1986. An organization shall make this election by filing with the service center with which it files its annual return a statement signed by a person authorized to act on behalf of the organization. That statement shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the electing organization and of the organization that established and maintains the electing organization,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the election as an election under section 44F(e)(4) of the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the date on which the election is to become effective (in the case of elections filed before February 1, 1982, not earlier than the date that is 7 months before the date on which the election is filed; in the case of elections filed after January 31, 1982, not earlier than the date on which the election is filed), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide all information necessary to show that the organization is entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election to treat qualified subchapter S trust as grantor trust. This paragraph applies to the election provided under section 1371(g)(2) of the Code, as added by section 234(b) of the Act. The election to treat a qualified subchapter S trust as a grantor trust described in section 1371(e)(1)(A) of the Code is available for taxable years beginning after 1981. The beneficiary of the trust (or the legal representative of the beneficiary) shall make this election by signing and filing with the service center with which the subchapter S corporation files its income tax return a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the beneficiary, the trust, and the subchapter S corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as an election under section 1371(g)(2) of the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the date on which the election is to become effective (not earlier than 60 days before the date on which the election is filed), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides all information necessary to show that the beneficiary is entitled to make the election.
Note that this election does not itself constitute an election as to the status of the corporation; the corporation must make the election provided in section 1372(a) to be treated as an electing small business corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to have Code section 422A apply to options granted before 1981. This paragraph applies to the election provided under section 251(c)(1)(B) of the Act to have Code section 422A apply to certain options granted before 1981. A corporation may make only one election under this provision. Thus, a corporation that makes an election under this provision with respect to certain options granted before 1981 may not make any subsequent election under this provision with respect to other options granted before 1981. An election under this provision shall be made no later than the due date (taking extensions into account) of the income tax return of the corporation for its first taxable year during which either an option subject to the election or an option subject to the rules of section 422A of the Code is exercised. In any event, no election under this provision will be permitted after the due date (taking extensions into account) of the income tax return for the taxable year including December 31, 1982. A corporation shall make this election by attaching

to its income tax return (or amended return) a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as an election under section 251(c)(1)(B) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the options to which the election applies, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides all information necessary to show that the corporation is entitled to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Election to increase basis of property on which additional estate tax is imposed. This paragraph applies to the election provided under section 1016(c) of the Code, as amended by section 421(g) of the Act. The election to increase the basis of property on which additional estate tax is imposed is available with respect to the estates of decedents dying after 1981. The qualified heir shall make this election by filing with the Form 706-A (Additional Estate Tax Return) a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the qualified heir and of the estate,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as an election under section 1016(c) of the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the property with respect to which the election is made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provides any additional information required by the instructions accompanying Form 706-A.
A qualified heir making an election under this paragraph must pay interest on the additional estate tax from the date that is 9 months after the date of the decedent's death to the date of the payment of the additional estate tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Revocation of elections. Elections under paragraph (f) of this section are irrevocable. Other elections made under this section may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke an election shall be signed by the applicant and filed with the service center with which the election was filed and shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of all parties identified in connection with the election,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the election being revoked by reference to the section of the Code or Act under which the election was made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the scope of the election, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Explain why the applicant seeks to revoke the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Additional information required. If later regulations issued under the section of the Code or Act under which the election was made require the furnishing of information in addition to that which was furnished with the statement of election and an office of the Internal Revenue Service requests the taxpayer to provide the additional information, the taxpayer shall furnish the additional information in a statement filed with that office of the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days after the request is made.

In the case of an ownership interest held by a partnership or an S corporation, the partnership or S corporation shall make the election. Each person making the election shall do so in accordance with paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, and shall identify in the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section the persons with ownership interests in the sound recording, and shall state that each such person is making the election with respect to that sound recording.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules for making the election with respect to redemption through use of related corporations. For either election available under section 712(l)(7) of the Act (relating to redemptions through related corporations) to be effective, such election must be made jointly by both the issuing and acquiring corporations. The election is made jointly when both the issuing and acquiring corporations make the election in accordance with paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rules for making the election for investment tax credit at risk rules. The election under section 431(e)(2) of the Act is made by filing an amended return for the first taxable year ending after February 18, 1981, during which taxable year property, to which the amendments made by section 211(f) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 apply, was placed in service. If that taxable year is a closed year, the election is made by filing an amended return for the first succeeding open taxable year, but in such event this election can be made only if the aggregate amount of the investment tax credit that would have been allowable in the closed years had the election been effective for those years is greater than or equal to the amount of the investment tax credits actually claimed in the closed years. In the case of partnerships and S corporations, the election under section 431(e) is made, respectively, at the partner or the shareholder level. Any election made under section 431(e) shall apply to all property of the taxpayer to which the

amendments made by section 211(f) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 apply. Amended returns must be filed for any year the tax liability for which is affected by making this election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rules for certain elections by life insurance companies--(A) Election with respect to loss from operations of member of group. Any life insurance company that makes an election under section 806(d)(4) must include on the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the members of the controlled group that did not file a consolidated return with the life insurance company for the taxable year to which the election applies, the amount of loss subject to the limitation provided by section 806(d)(4)(B), and a computation showing how such amount was derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Election to use preceding year's interest rate for non-annuity reserves. If the election under section 807(d)(4)(C) is not made for all non-annuity contracts issued by the life insurance company before the end of the taxable year in which the election is made, the company must reasonably identify, in the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the contracts or groups of contracts for which the election is made. The statement, however, need not specify each individual contract for which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revocation. The elections under Act sections 31(a), 31(g)(16), 31(f), 113, 211 (Code section 810(b)(3)), 216(c) (1) and (2), 217(l), 431(e)(2), and 712(l)(7) (B) and (C)(ii) are irrevocable. Elections under Act sections 41(a) (Code sections 1282(b)(2) and 1283(c)(2)), 211 (Code sections 806(d)(4), and 807(d)(4)(C)), 217(i), 1066, and 1078 are revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner. A revocation under Act section 211 (Code section 807(d)(4)(C)) shall be treated as a change in basis of computing reserves that is subject to the adjustment provided in section 807(f) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Church or qualified church-controlled organization's election of exemption from social security taxes under chapter 21--(1) In general. This paragraph applies to the election under section 3121(w) of the Code, as added by section 2603(b) of the Act, by a church or qualified church-controlled organization (as defined in section 3121(w)(3)) that service performed in the employ of such church or organization shall be excluded from employment for purposes of title II of the Social Security Act and chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any election made under section 3121(w) shall apply to all services performed on or after January 1, 1984, by employees of such church or organization (whether or not they were employees on that date or on the date the election is made). Employees of the electing church or organization are subject to the provisions of chapter 2 of the Code (relating to the tax on self-employment income) as amended by section 2603 (c)(2) and (d)(2) of the Act for service performed for such church or organization on or after January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time for making the election.

Any election under section 3121(w) by a church or organization for which the first quarterly employment tax return for the tax imposed under section 3111 is due (or would be due but for this election) after October 31, 1984, must be made on or before the day before the first date that such tax return would be due from the church or organization (disregarding any extension of such due date). A purported election filed after the date prescribed in this paragraph (b)(2) shall be void.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of making the election. To make an election under section 3121(w), a church or qualified church-controlled organization must certify that it is opposed for religious reasons to the payment of the tax imposed by section 3111 (relating to the employer tax) of the Code. The election and certification are made by executing and filing Form 8274 in accordance with the form and its instructions. The form shall be signed by an official authorized to sign tax returns for the church or organization. Where tax imposed by section 3111 is reported (or would be reported but for this election) with respect to more

than one church or organization on a single quarterly employment tax return, and the election under section 3121(w) is made, then all of the churches and organizations covered by the last such return filed before such election was made for which the time for making the election has not expired shall be covered by the election unless specifically excluded by stating such exclusion in the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Refunds of FICA taxes paid. Where a church or qualified church-controlled organization makes a timely election under section 3121(w), a refund, without interest, shall be made to such church or organization of any taxes paid under sections 3101 and 3111 with respect to service performed after December 31, 1983, covered by the election. However, the refund will be made only if the church or organization agrees on its claim for the refund to pay to each employee covered by the election the portion of the refund attributable to the tax imposed on the wages of the employee by section 3101. The employee may not receive any other refund of such taxes. The claim for refund shall be made by the church or organization by filing Form 843 with the service center where the Form 941 on which the taxes subject to refund was filed. Form 843 shall be executed in accordance with the form and its instructions, and also in accordance with the instructions to Form 8274 that relate to Form 843.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Irrevocability of election except by Commissioner. An election under section 3121 shall be irrevocable by the electing church or organization. The Commissioner, however, shall permanently revoke the election if the church or organization fails to furnish the information required under section 6051 to the Internal Revenue Service for a period of 2 years or more and also fails to furnish such information within 60 days after a written request therefor is made by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election to issue taxable student loan bonds. This paragraph applies to the election by an issuer to issue taxable student loan bonds under section 625(c) of the Act. The election is available for obligations issued after December 31, 1983, and is made by filing a statement and necessary attachments with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255, prior to the issuance of such taxable bonds. The statement shall identify the election as made under section 625(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and shall contain the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the issuer, and the total purchase price, face amount and interest rate of the issue, bond issuance costs, amounts allocated to reasonably required reserve or replacement funds, and the date of issue. The issuer shall attach to the statement of election a copy of previous Internal Revenue Service correspondence relating to the tax exempt status of the issuing authority and a statement containing the total purchase price, face amount, interest rate, bond issuance costs, amounts allocated to reasonably required reserve or replacement funds, and the date of issuance of outstanding tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer. With respect to outstanding tax exempt issues of student loan bonds of the issuer issued after December 31, 1982, the issuer may alternatively attach copies of the Form 8038 filed with respect to such issues. Each taxable student loan bond must state on its face that the interest paid on such bond is subject to federal income taxation. An election with respect to an issue is irrevocable once made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election not to claim the credit for alcohol used as fuel. The election under section 40(f) (as added by section 474(k) of the Act) not to claim the alcohol fuels credit is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, and shall be made for the taxable year in which such credit is determined by not claiming such credit on an original return or amended return at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for the taxable year (determined without regard for extensions). The election may be revoked within the 3-year period by filing an amended return and claiming the credit on the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Protective election to adopt LIFO method--(1) Time for making the election. A protective election in connection with the enactment of section 95 of the

Act to adopt the LIFO method of accounting for inventory under section 472 of the Code can only be made for the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after July 18, 1984, and must be made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the tax return for such taxable year. Once made, the election is irrevocable unless the Commissioner authorizes the use of another inventory method (see Sec. 1.472-5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner for making a protective election. The protective election is made by completing all line items on a current Form 970 and indicating that the election is a protective election filed in connection with the enactment of section 95 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. The Form 970 must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which the protective election is made. The LIFO method adopted under the protective election must be consistent in all respects with the taxpayer's LIFO method used in the taxpayer's most recently completed taxable year for which the LIFO method was used. In completing the current Form 970, the taxpayer shall specify the method of inventory valuation that the taxpayer would have used, the opening LIFO inventory for the taxable year for which the protective election is made, and the section 481 adjustment that would be required, as if the taxpayer were not on the LIFO method for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the protective election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Election by an estate or trust to recognize gain or loss on the distribution of property (other than cash) to a beneficiary. This paragraph applies to the election made by a trust or estate to recognize gain or loss on the distribution of property (other than cash) to a beneficiary under section 643(d) of the Code as amended by section 81 of the Act. The election is available for distributions made after June 1, 1984, in taxable years ending after such date. The election must be made by the fiduciary who is required to make the return of the estate or trust under section 641 and Sec. 1.641(b)-2. The election shall be made by such fiduciary on the tax return of the estate or trust for the taxable year with respect to which the distribution of property was made and must be filed by the due date (including extensions) of such return. Until the Form 1041, U.S. Fiduciary Income Tax Return is revised, the election should be made by including the gain or loss on the Schedule D (or other appropriate schedule, if applicable) of the Form 1041 and attaching the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the tax return on which the election is made and including on that statement the name and taxpayer identification number of the distributee. For distributions made after June 1, 1984, and before July 18, 1984, the election must be filed by the later of the due date (including extentions) of the tax return of the estate or trust for the taxable year with respect to which the distribution was made or January 1, 1985. For those distributions, the fiduciary may make the election in the manner described above on a tax return, or amended return, for the year with respect to which the distribution was made. An election under section 643(d) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. The request for revocation of an election should be made by the fiduciary in the form of a ruling request and must contain the information required by regulations and revenue procedures pertaining thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Election to treat a stapled foreign entity as a subsidiary. This paragraph applies to the election, provided under section 136(c)(6) of the Act, to treat a foreign corporation which was a stapled entity with a domestic corporation as of June 30, 1983, as being owned (to the extent of its stapled interests) by the domestic corporation with which it is stapled. This treatment, if so elected, is in lieu of the treatment prescribed in section 269B(a)(1) of the Code, as added by the Act. This election may be made by the domestic corporation with which the foreign entity is stapled. The election may not be made by the foreign entity or by shareholders of the domestic corporation. This election must be made no later than January 14, 1985, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. This election shall be effective after December 31, 1986. The domestic corporation shall make this

election by filing with the service center with which the domestic corporation files its income tax return a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the domestic corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identifies the election as made under section 136(c)(6) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identifies the foreign entity and the interests in the foreign entity which constitute stapled interests with respect to the stock of the domestic corporation, and specifies the date on which those interests became stapled interests.
If this election is not made, the foreign corporation (interests in which were stapled interests as of June 30, 1983) will be treated as a domestic corporation, effective January 1, 1987, under section 269B(a)(1) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Election to treat certain section 1248 amounts as included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A). This paragraph applies to the elections, provided under section 133(d)(3) of the Act, to treat amounts included in the gross income of any person as a dividend by reason of section 1248 (a) or (f) after October 9, 1975, and before July 19, 1985, as an amount included in the gross income of such person under section 951(a)(1)(A). The election with respect to transactions to which section 1248(a) applies may be made by the foreign corporation described in section 1248(a) (or its successor in interest). The election with respect to transactions to which section 1248(f) applies may be made by the domestic corporation described in section 1248(f)(1) (or its successor in interest). Neither election may be made by an affected shareholder of any such corporation (unless the shareholder is the successor in interest). This election must be made no later than January 14, 1985, and shall apply with respect to all transactions to which section 1248 (a) or (f) applies that occurred after October 9, 1975, and before July 19, 1984. Once made, the election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. A foreign corporation shall make this election by filing the statement described in this paragraph with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. A domestic corporation shall make this election by filing the statement described in this paragraph with the service center with which the domestic corporation files its income tax return. In either case, the statement shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number (if any) of the corporation making the election,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the election as made under section 133(d)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identify all of the transactions (including the date of each transaction), shareholders involved in those transactions, and amounts to which the election applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Special election for computing investment company taxable income. This paragraph applies to the election by a regulated investment company provided under section 1071(b) of the Act, which added section 852(b)(2)(F) to the Code. Under section 852(b)(2)(F), the taxable income of a regulated investment company shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects. The election may be made only for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. A regulated investment company shall make the election by computing taxable income without regard to section 454(b) on its return for the first taxable year for which it desires the election to apply and shall attach the statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the return on which the election is made. A regulated investment company shall make the election by the time set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Once made, the election applies to the first taxable year for which it is made and to all subsequent taxable years and cannot be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Election of extension of time for payment of estate tax for interests in certain holding companies. An election under section 6166(b)(8), as added by section 1021(a) of the Act, or under section 1021(d)(2) of the Act, shall be made by including on the notice of election under section 6166 required by Sec. 20.6166-1(b) a statement that an election is being made under section 6166(b)(8) or section 1021(d)(2) of the Act (whichever

is applicable) and the facts which formed the basis for the executor's conclusion that the estate qualified for such election. If a taxpayer makes an election described in this paragraph (k), then the special 4-percent interest rate of section 6601(j) and the 5-year deferral of principal payments of section 6166(a)(3) are not available. Thus, the first installment of tax is due on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) and subsequent installments bear interest at the rate determined under section 6621. If the executor makes an election described in this paragraph (k) and the notice of election under section 6166 fails to state the amount of tax to be paid in installments or the number of installments, then the election is presumed to be for the maximum amount so payable and for payment thereof in 10 equal annual installments, beginning on the date prescribed in section 6151(a). The elections described under this paragraph (k) are available for estates of decedents dying after July 18, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Subchapter S election by commodities dealers and options dealers. This paragraph applies to a commodities dealer or options dealer referred to in section 102(d)(3) of the Act (relating to the election by such a dealer to be an S corporation) whose taxable year is the calendar year and that was a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361(b) of the Code) as of January 1, 1984. The election by such a dealer under section 102(d)(3) of the Act shall be made in the manner prescribed by section 1362 and the regulations thereunder, except that the election under section 102(d)(3) must be made before October 2, 1984. In addition to making the election in the manner prescribed under such section 1362 and the regulations thereunder, the commodities dealer or options dealer must indicate on Form 2553 that the election is made under section 102(d)(3) of the Act. Although section 102(d)(3) of the Act applies to dealers not covered by this paragraph, and such dealers may make an election under such section 102(d)(3), guidelines for making such an election are not provided in this paragraph and are forthcoming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Election with respect to treatment of S termination year. For the election provided under section 1362(e)(3), as amended by section 721(h) of the Act, see Sec. 18.1362-4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Election to be an S corporation; certain short taxable years. For the election provided under section 1362(b), as amended by section 721(l) of the Act, see Sec. 18.1362-1(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Election with respect to subchapter S passive investment income rules.

For the election provided under section 1371(e), as amended by section 721(o) of the Act, see Sec. 18.1371-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> No elections for closed year. Any election under this section which is allowed to be made by filing an amended return may only be made if the period for making a claim for refund or credit with respect to the taxable year for which such election is to be effective has not expired. This paragraph shall not apply to the election under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section with respect to the election under section 1078 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Additional information required. Later regulations or revenue procedures issued under provisions of the Code or Act covered by this section may require the furnishing of information in addition to that which was furnished with the statement of election described herein. In such event the later regulations or revenue procedures will provide guidance with respect to the furnishing of such additional information.

The elections under sections 42(d)(3)(B), 42(f)(1), 42(g)(3)(B)(i), 42(i)(2)(B), and 42(j)(5)(B) of the Code generally must be made for the taxable year in which the building is placed in service, or the succeeding taxable year if the section 42(f)(1) election is made to defer the start of the credit period, and must be made in the certification required to be filed pursuant to section 42(l) (1) and (2), as amended by the Act. The election under section 42(j)(5)(B) of the Code must be made by the later of the due date of the certification or January 22, 1990. The election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii) must be made in accordance with the requirements of Notice 89-1, 1989-2 I.R.B. 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election to treat certain carryovers of disallowed investment interest expense as passive activity deductions. The requirements of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to an election under section 1005(c)(11) of the Act. Instead, the election must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed in Notice 89-36, 1989-13 I.R.B. 6. Thus, the election must be made before the filing deadline specified in Notice 89-36 by amending previously filed returns to reflect any change in the computation of tax liability that results from the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election with respect to the treatment of reasonably estimated losses in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution--(1) In general. This paragraph (d) applies to an election under section 905(a) of the 1986 Act, and to an election under section 1009(d) of the Act, both relating to section 165(l) of the Code. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As of the close of the taxable year, it can reasonably be estimated that there is a loss on a deposit (within the meaning of section 165(l)(4)) of a qualified individual (as defined in section 165(l)(2)) in a qualified financial institution (as defined in section 165(l)(3)), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such loss is on account of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such institution, then the qualified individual may elect under either section 165(l)(1) or (5) (but not both), to treat the amount (subject to the applicable limitations if under section 165(l)(5)) so estimated for that taxable year as a loss described in either section 165(c)(3), relating to casualty losses, or section 165(c)(2), relating to transactions entered into for profit, and incurred during the taxable year.
The election will apply to all losses of the qualified individual on deposits in the institution with respect to which an election is made. For additional information and examples of the application of the election rules, see Notice 89-28, 1989-12 I.R.B. 72.</p><p class="depth0">This paragraph (d) includes the procedural and the principal substantive rules first issued in Notice 89-28. For specific rules relating to an election under section 165(1)(5), see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific rules relating to the section 165(1)(5) election--(i) Applicability. An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code may be made only if no part of the taxpayer's deposits in the financial institution is federally insured. Generally, this requirement will be met only in cases in which none of the deposits in the financial institution are federally insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dollar limitations. An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code is limited to $20,000 ($10,000 in the case of a separate return by a married individual) in aggregate losses on deposits in any one financial institution. The applicable dollar limit must be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds that can reasonably be expected to be received under any state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and manner of determining loss and making the election--(i) Year of election and determination of loss. A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code either for the first taxable year in which a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made or for a later taxable year that is prior to the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. The amount of the loss is determined by the difference between a taxpayer's basis in the deposits

and the amount that is reasonably estimated to be recovered, taking into account all facts and circumstances reasonably available to the taxpayer as of the date the election is made. A reasonable estimate might be based, for example, on the percentage of total deposits likely to be recovered by the depositors according to a determination made by the regulatory authority or trustee having responsibility over the institution. In addition, the taxpayer's basis in the deposits must be reduced to the extent that a loss is claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time and manner of making election. A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which the taxpayer made a reasonable estimate of the loss;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An amended income tax return for a taxable year described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, if the period prescribed for filing a claim for refund or credit for that taxable year has not yet expired; or, if applicable,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An amended income tax return for a taxable year (beginning after December 31, 1981) described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, whether or not the claim for refund or credit is barred by another provision of law, but only if the amended return is properly filed on or before November 9, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Information to include with election. The election should include any information requested in the applicable forms and instructions (e.g., Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts). If the applicable form(s) and instructions do not make reference to or request information concerning this election, the taxpayer should, on an appropriate line or space clearly indicate the name of the financial institution, include the following language: ``Insolvent Financial Institution Election,'' and include the calculation of the reasonably estimated loss claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revocability of the election--(i) In general. If a taxpayer desires to revoke an election under section 165(l) of the Code, the taxpayer must request, in writing, the consent of the Secretary setting forth the pertinent facts surrounding the election and the reasons for requesting a revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. With respect to an election made under section 165(l)(1) of the Code prior to November 9, 1989, a qualified individual may revoke such election without securing the prior consent of the Secretary but only if the taxpayer makes an election under section 165(l)(5) by November 9, 1989, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective date. Paragraph (d) of this section is generally effective for elections made under section 165(1) of the Code on or after November 10, 1988. However, an election filed prior to February 24, 1989, that is made in any reasonable manner will be effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to treat a survivor annuity payable to a surviving spouse as a nondeductible terminable interest.

The issuer must retain a copy of the election until 6 years after the date the last bond that is part of the issue is retired. In addition, while the facilities are nongovernmentally owned, any publicly recorded document with respect to the facilities must state that neither the electing owner, nor any person purchasing the facilities during the period the bonds are outstanding or within 6 years after the date the last bond that is part of the issue is retired, nor any successor in interest to the electing owner or such purchaser, may claim any deduction under section 167 or 168 of the Code or any credit with respect to the facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election is binding on purchasers and successors.

Sec. 301.9100-14T  Individual's election to terminate taxable year when case commences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules for making the election under section 1398(d)(2) to terminate the taxable year of an individual taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Availability of election. This election is available to an individual taxpayer in a case commenced after March 24, 1981, under chapter 7 (relating to liquidations) or chapter 11 (relating to reorganizations) of title 11 of the United States Code. If the case is dismissed, the taxpayer cannot make the election, and an election previously made will be void. For purposes of this section, a partnership is not treated as an individual. If the taxpayer making the election is married (within the meaning of section 143), the election is available to the taxpayer's spouse, but only if the spouse is eligible to file, and does file, a joint return with the taxpayer for the taxable year ended as a result of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of election. The election terminates the taxable year of the taxpayer (and of a spouse who joins in the election) on the day before the commencement date of the case. A new taxable year begins on the commencement date and (unless terminated earlier) ends on the date on which the taxpayer's taxable year in which the case commenced would have ended if the election had not been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time and manner. A taxpayer to whom the election is available makes the election by filing a return for the short taxable year ending the day before commencement of the case (the ``first short taxable year'') on or before the 15th day of the fourth full month following the end of that first short taxable year. The spouse of such a taxpayer makes the election by making a

joint return with the taxpayer for that first short taxable year within the time prescribed in the preceding sentence. To facilitate processing, the taxpayer should write ``Section 1398 Election'' at the top of the return. A taxpayer may also make the election by attaching a statement of election to an application for extension of time for filing a return that satisfies the requirements under section 6081 for the first short taxable year. The application for extension must be submitted under section 6081 on or before the due date of the return for the first short taxable year. The statement must state that the taxpayer elects under section 1398(d)(2) to close his or her taxable year as of the day before commencement of the case. If the taxpayer's spouse elects to close his or her taxable year, the spouse must join in the application for extension and in the statement of election. If a joint return is not filed for the first short taxable year, the election of the spouse made with the application is void.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Irrevocability of election. The election is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent bankruptcy case of debtor's spouse. If a case under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code commences with respect to the spouse of a debtor to whom an election under this section was available, the spouse can make an election under this section even if the spouse's case commences in the same taxable year in which the debtor's case commences. The spouse can make the election whether or not the spouse previously joined in the debtor's election. If the spouse joined in the debtor's election, or if the debtor did not make the election, the debtor may join in the spouse's election, assuming the debtor is otherwise eligible to file a joint return with the spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example. (1) Assume that husband and wife are calendar-year taxpayers, that a bankruptcy case involving only the husband commences on March 1, 1982, and that a bankruptcy case involving only the wife commences on October 10, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the husband does not make an election, his taxable year would not be affected; i.e., it does not terminate on February 28. If the husband does make an election, his first short taxable year would be January 1 through February 28; his second short taxable year would begin March 1. The tax return for his first short taxable year would be due on June 15. The wife could join in the husband's election, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through February 28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The wife could elect to terminate her taxable year on October 9. If she did, and if the husband had not made an election or if the wife had not joined in the husband's election, she would have two taxable years in 1982--the first from January 1 through October 9, and the second from October 10 through December 31. The tax return for her first short taxable year would be due on February 15, 1983. If the husband had not made an election to terminate his taxable year on February 28, the husband could join in an election by his wife, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through October 9. If the husband had made an election but the wife had not joined in the husband's election, the husband could not join in an election by the wife to terminate her taxable year on October 9, since they could not file a joint return for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the wife makes the election relating to her own bankruptcy case, and had joined the husband in making an election relating to his case, she would have two additional taxable years with respect to her 1982 income and deductions--the second short taxable year would be March 1 through October 9, and the third short taxable year would be October 10 through December 31. The husband could join in the wife's election if they file a joint return for the second short taxable year. If the husband joins in the wife's election, they could file joint returns for the short taxable year ending December 31, but would not be required to do so.

Sec. 301.9100-16T  Election to accrue vacation pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 463 provides that taxpayers whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting may elect without the consent of the Commissioner, to deduct certain amounts with respect to vacation pay which, because of contingencies, would not otherwise be deductible. Such election must apply to the liability for all vacation pay accounts maintained by the taxpayer within a single trade or business if the liability is contingent when vacation pay is earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time for making election. (1) In the case of a taxpayer who established or maintained a vacation pay account pursuant to I.T. 3956 and who continued to maintain such account pursuant to section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended, for its last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, the election must be made for each trade or business for which such account was maintained on or before the later of (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973. The election pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective with respect to an account described in this paragraph (b)(1) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1972. Failure to file such election shall constitute a change in the method of accounting for vacation pay for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 1972. Such change in accounting method will be considered a change initiated by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a trade or business of a taxpayer to which paragraph (b)(1) does not apply, the election provided for in this section may be made for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973, by making the election not later than (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year for which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A taxpayer who elects under section 463 to treat vacation pay as provided in this section and who wishes to revoke such election may only do so with the consent of the Commissioner. Such revocation shall constitute a change in the method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Manner of making election. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the election provided for in this section must be made by means of a statement attached to a timely filed income tax return. The statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is electing to apply the provisions of section 463, and shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's name and a description of each vacation pay plan to which the election is to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A schedule with appropriate explanations showing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a vacation pay account established or maintained pursuant to I.T. 3956 and section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The balance of each such vacation pay account maintained by the taxpayer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount, determined as if the taxpayer had maintained a vacation pay account for the last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by employees, before the close of the taxable year and payable during such taxable year or within 12 months following the close of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of other vacation pay accounts, the amount of the closing balances the taxpayer would have had for the taxpayer's 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the election was made, had

the taxpayer maintained an account representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by the employees before the close of the taxable year and payable during the taxable year or within 12 months following the close of the taxable year throughout the 3 immediately preceding taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amounts accrued and deducted for prior years for vacation pay but not paid at the close of the taxable year preceding the year for which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where a taxpayer has filed its return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973 prior to July 21, 1975, and has not made the election pursuant to this section, the election may be made by filing an amended return (showing adjustments, in any) for such year and attaching the statement required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section on or before July 21, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The time for making the election may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). X, whose taxable year begins on February 1, files, its return based on the accrual method of accounting. X has continuously accrued and deducted for income tax purposes contingent amounts of vacation pay, pursuant to I.T. 3956. Pursuant to section 463 and these regulations, in order for X to continue accruing and deducting its vacation pay amounts, X must elect to account for vacation pay under section 463 by attaching the election to its timely filed return for its taxable year ending on January 31, 1975, or if X has already filed such return by July 21, 1975, without such election, by filing the election statement with an amended return by July 21, 1975. If X does not make the election under section 463, X will be treated as having initiated a change in its method of accounting for vacation pay in its taxable year ending on January 31, 1973.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Y, a calendar year taxpayer files its returns based on the accrual method of accounting. Y deducted its vacation pay amounts only when paid since such amounts were contingent when earned and Y was not entitled to the benefits of I.T. 3956, Y may elect for its taxable year ending on December 31, 1974, to deduct certain amounts with respect to contingent vacation pay which were not otherwise deductible, by filing an election pursuant to these regulations with its timely filed income tax return for such year or if such return was already filed by [insert date 90 days after publication of this document as a Treasury decision], without such election, by filing the election with an amended return filed by July 21, 1975.

corporation; the internal revenue officer with whom the corporation's returns of income have been filed for each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; the names and addresses of all persons who have been shareholders of the corporation at any time during each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; computations showing the amount of the corporation's overpayment or deficiency of tax for any taxable year which is attributable to the election under this paragraph; and computations showing each shareholder's portion of the undistributed taxable income (determined as provided in section 1373(b) of the Code) or net operating loss (determined as provided in section 1374(c) of the Code) for each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, unless such computations were made on the corporation's returns of income for each of such years. In order for an election under this paragraph to be effective, it must be accompanied by the consents of certain shareholders as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consents by shareholders. An election by a corporation pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by the consent of each person who was a shareholder of the corporation at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966. This includes persons who may not be shareholders on the date the election is filed. Where stock of the corporation was owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which was community property), or was owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person who had a community interest in such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or by his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. If a person who is required to file a consent under this subparagraph is deceased, the executor or administrator of such person's estate, or other person charged with the property of such person, shall file the required consent. The consent of each shareholder shall be in the form of a statement signed by the shareholder in which he states that he consents to the election by the corporation under this paragraph. Each of such statements shall set forth the name and address of the corporation and of the shareholder; the number of shares of stock of the corporation owned by such shareholder at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962; the date (or dates) on which such stock was acquired, and, if disposed of, the date (or dates) of disposition; and the internal revenue officer with whom the shareholder's income tax returns have been filed for each of such taxable years in which he owned any such stock. In addition, a consent under this paragraph is not effective unless (i) the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for each taxable year for which there would be a deficiency attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph has not expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed, and (ii) there is included in, or attached to, the statement of consent a written consent that the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year (to the extent that such deficiency is attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph) shall not expire before the expiration of 1 year after the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed. Each of the statements of consent under this subparagraph shall be filed with the corporation's election under this paragraph. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election and consents are binding. The election and consents under this paragraph are binding and may not be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> New shareholders. Section 1372(e)(1) of the Code provides that an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall terminate if certain new shareholders do not consent to such election within the time prescribed by regulations. New shareholders of a corporation which makes

an election under paragraph (b) of this section may not have consented to the corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code within such prescribed time as a result of a termination of such election under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 89-389. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be treated as terminated for the failure of any new shareholder to file a timely consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, for any of the taxable years of the corporation between and including the earliest taxable year determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and the taxable year during which the corporation files an election under paragraph (b) of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code would have terminated for a taxable year under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code in the event it had not made an election under paragraph (b) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A proper consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code is filed by such new shareholder with the corporation's election under paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 301.9100-20T  Election to treat certain distributions as made onthe last day of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 233(b) of the Revenue Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 112) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by adding to section 1375 a new subsection (e) (relating to certain distributions after close of taxable year). Section 1375(e) provides that a corporation, with the consent of its shareholders, may elect, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, to treat a distribution of money made after the close of the taxable year as made, and as received by its shareholders, on the last day of such taxable year if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The corporation makes a distribution of money to its shareholders on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of a taxable year with respect to which it was an electing small business corporation within the meaning of section 1371(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such distribution is made pursuant to a resolution of the corporation's board of directors, adopted before the close of such taxable year, to distribute to its shareholders all or a part of the proceeds of one or more sales of capital assets, or of property described in section 1231(b), made during such taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each shareholder on the day such distribution is received--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Owns the same proportion of the stock of the corporation on such day as he owned on the last day of such taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consents to such election. Section 1375(e) applies only with respect to taxable years of corporations beginning after December 31, 1957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner for making election--(1) Taxable years ending after February 26, 1964. For taxable years ending after February 26, 1964, an election under section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year shall be made by attaching to the corporation income tax return for such taxable year, filed not later than the time (including extensions thereof) prescribed by law, the following documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the corporation elects the application of section 1375(e) and the date and amount of each distribution to which the election applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the resolution of the board of directors referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement of the consent of each shareholder of the corporation containing the information required by, and filed in the manner provided in, paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and ending on or before February 26, 1964. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and ending on or before February 26, 1964, an election under section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year shall be made on or before June 25, 1964, by either attaching the documents described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to its income tax return for such taxable year, or by filing such documents with the district director with whom the corporation has filed, or intends to file,

its income tax return for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election is binding. An election under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph is binding and may not be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Shareholders' consent. The consent of a shareholder to an election under section 1375(e) shall be in the form of a statement signed by the shareholder in which such shareholder consents to the election of the corporation. Such shareholder's consent is binding and may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. Each person who is a shareholder of the electing corporation must consent to the election; thus, where stock of the corporation is owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which is community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. The statement shall set forth the name, address, and account number of the corporation and of the shareholder, the date the distribution is received, the number and proportion of the shares of stock of the corporation owned by him on the date the distribution is received, and the number and proportion of such shares owned by him on the last day of the taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the election is made. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.
