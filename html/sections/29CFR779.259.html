                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>, does not exclude the dollar volume of sales  or business of that establishment from the annual gross volume of the  enterprise. However, the dollar volume of an establishment derived from  transactions with other establishments in the same enterprise does not  ordinarily constitute part of the annual gross volume of the enterprise  as a whole. The computation of the annual gross volume of sales or  business of the enterprise is made ``exclusive of excise taxes at the  retail level which are separately stated''. The taxes which may be  excluded are discussed in Sec. Sec. 779.261 through 779.264. The  methods of calculating the annual gross volume of sales of an enterprise  are set forth in Sec. Sec. 779.265 through 779.269.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the ordinary case the functions of a leased department are  controlled or unified in such a way that it is included in the  establishment and therefore in the enterprise in which it is located, as  discussed in Sec. 779.225. The applicability of enterprise coverage and  certain exemptions to such a leased department depends upon the  enterprise coverage and the exemption status of the establishment in  which the leased department is located. The annual gross volume of such  a leased department is included in the annual gross volume of the  establishment in which it is located as well as in the annual gross  volume of the enterprise of which such establishment is a part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Likewise, where franchise or other arrangements result in the  creation of a larger enterprise by means of operational restrictions so  that the establishment, dealer, or concessionaire   is an integral part of the related activities of the enterprise which  grants the franchise, right, or concession, as discussed in Sec. Sec.  779.229 and 779.232, it will follow that the annual gross volume of  sales made or business done of such an enterprise includes the dollar  volume of sales or business of each related establishment dealer, or  concessionaire.</p>
