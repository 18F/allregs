                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial determination of family eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA is  responsible for receipt and review of applications, and determination of  family eligibility for participation in accordance with HUD regulations  (see 24 CFR parts 5, 750 and 760). The PHA is responsible for verifying  the sources and amount of the family's income and other information  necessary for determining income eligibility and the amount of the  assistance payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> PHA records on applicants and Families selected to participate  must be maintained so as to provide HUD with racial, gender, and ethnic  data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selection of Families for participation. When vacancies occur,  the PHA will refer to the Owner one or more appropriate size Families on  its waiting list. The PHA must select Families for participation in  accordance with the provisions of the Program and in accordance with the  PHA's application, including any PHA requirement or preferences as  approved by HUD. The PHA must select Families eligible for housing  assistance payments currently residing in units that are designated for  rehabilitation under the Program   without requiring that these Families be placed on the waiting list.  Notwithstanding the fact that the PHA may not be accepting additional  applications for participation because of the length of the waiting  list, the PHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list  if the applicant is otherwise eligible for partcipation and claims that  he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part  5, unless the PHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants  who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference,  and the anticipated number of admissions under this part, that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to  qualify for a Federal preference and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's system for  applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the  applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the  waiting list, the applicant would qualify for assistance before other  applicants on the waiting list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Owner selection of Families. All vacant units under Contract  must be rented to Eligible Families referred by the PHA from its waiting  list. However, if the PHA is unable to refer a sufficient number of  interested applicants on the waiting list to the Owner within 30 days of  the Owner's notification to the PHA of a vacancy, the Owner may  advertise or solicit applications from Low-Income Families and refer  such Families to the PHA to determine eligibility. Since the Owner is  responsible for tenant selection, the Owner may refuse any family,  provided that the Owner does not unlawfully discriminate. However, the  Owner must not deny program assistance or admission to an applicant  based on the fact that the applicant is or has been a victim of domestic  violence, dating violence, or stalking, if the applicant otherwise  qualifies for assistance or admission. Should the Owner reject a Family,  and should the Family believe that the Owner's rejection was the result  of unlawful discrimination, the Family may request the assistance of the  PHA in resolving the issue. If the issue cannot be resolved promptly,  the Family may file a complaint with HUD, and the PHA may refer the  Family to the next available Moderate Rehabilitation unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Briefing of Families. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a Family is initially determined  to be eligible for housing assistance payments or is selected for  participation in accordance with this section, the PHA must provide the  Family with information as to the Tenant Rent and the PHA's schedule of  Utility Allowances. Each Family must also, either in group or individual  sessions, be provided with a full explanation of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Family and Owner responsibilities under the Lease and Contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Significant aspects of the applicable State and local laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Significant aspects of Federal, State and local fair housing  laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The fact that the subsidy is tied to the unit and the Family  must occupy a unit rehabilitated under the Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Family's options under the Program should the Family be  required to move due to an increase or decrease in Family size; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The advisability and availability of blood lead level screening  for children under 6 years of age and HUD's lead-based paint  requirements in part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all Families to be temporarily relocated, the briefing must  include a discussion of the relocation policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Continued participation of Family when Contract is terminated.  If an Owner evicts an assisted family in violation of the Contract or  otherwise breaches the Contract, and the Contract for the unit is  terminated, and if the Family was not at fault and is eligible for  continued assistance, the Family may continue to receive housing  assistance through the conversion of the Moderate Rehabilitation  assistance to tenant-based assistance under the Section 8 certificate or  voucher program. The Family must then be issued a certificate or  voucher, and treated as any participant in the tenant-based programs  under 24 CFR part 982, and must be assisted by the PHA in finding a  suitable unit. All requirements of 24 CFR part 982 will be applicable  except that the term of any housing assistance payments contract may not  extend beyond the term of the initial   Moderate Rehabilitation Contract. If the Family is determined ineligible  for continued assistance, the certificate or voucher may be offered to  the next Family on the PHA's waiting list. The unit will remain under  the Moderate Rehabilitation ACC which provides for such a conversion of  the units; therefore no amendment to the ACC will be necessary to  convert to the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Families determined by the PHA to be ineligible. If a Family is  determined to be ineligible in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved  application, either at the application stage or after assistance has  been provided on behalf of the Family, the PHA shall promptly notify the  Family by letter of the determination and the reasons for it and the  letter shall state that the Family has the right within a reasonable  time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing. If, after  conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines, based on a  preponderance of the evidence, that the Family is ineligible, it shall  notify the Family in writing. The procedures of this paragraph do not  preclude the Family from exercising its other rights if it believes it  is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion,  sex, age, handicap, familial status, or national origin. The informal  review provisions for the denial of a Federal selection preference under  Sec. 882.517 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section. The  informal hearing requirements for denial and termination of assistance  on the basis of ineligible immigration status are contained in 24 CFR  part 5.
