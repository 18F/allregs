The refund shall be mailed to the  HFA for credit to the mortgagor's account. In computing the pro rata  portion of the annual mortgage insurance premium, the date of  termination of insurance shall be the last day of the month in which the  mortgage is prepaid or the Commissioner receives a notification of  termination, whichever is later. No refund shall be made if the  insurance was terminated because of the submission of an application for  initial claim payment or if the termination occurs before the date of  the first payment to principal.</p>
