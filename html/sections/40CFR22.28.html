The motion shall be made to the Presiding Officer and filed with the Regional Hearing Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of motion to reopen a hearing. Within 15 days following the service of a motion to reopen a hearing, any other party to the proceeding may file with the Regional Hearing Clerk and serve on all other parties a response.
