Sec. 217.36 or 217.37, but only as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An investing Board-regulated institution that has obtained a  credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize  the credit risk mitigant under Sec. Sec. 217.36 or 217.37, but only as  provided in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mismatches. A Board-regulated institution must make any  applicable adjustment to the protection amount of an eligible guarantee  or credit derivative as required in Sec. 217.36(d), (e), and (f) for  any hedged securitization exposure. In the context of a synthetic   securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative  covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual  maturities, the Board-regulated institution must use the longest  residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual  maturity of all hedged exposures.
