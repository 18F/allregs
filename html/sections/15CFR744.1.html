The following are steps you should follow in using the provisions of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review each end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the scope of these prohibitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of the end-use and end-user prohibitions described in

this part are applicable to your planned export, reexport, transfer (in-country) or other activity. See Supplement No. 1 to part 732 for guidance. For exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) that are in transit at the time you are informed by BIS that a license is required in accordance with Sec. Sec. 744.2(b), 744.3(b), 744.4(b) or 744.6(b) of the EAR, you may not proceed any further with the transaction unless you first obtain a license from BIS (see part 748 of the EAR for instructions on how to apply for a license). The provisions of Sec. 748.4(d)(2) shall not apply to license applications submitted pursuant to a notification from BIS that occurs while an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is in transit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A list of entities is included in Supplement No. 4 to this part 744 of the EAR (Entity List).
