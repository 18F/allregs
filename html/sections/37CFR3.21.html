                                Sec.  3.21  Identification of patents and patent applications.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An assignment relating to a patent must identify the patent by the  patent number. An assignment relating to a national patent application  must identify the national patent application by the application number  (consisting of the series code and the serial number; e.g., 07/123,456).  An assignment relating to an international patent application which  designates the United States of America must identify the international  application by the international application number; e.g., PCT/   US2012/012345. An assignment relating to an international design  application which designates the United States of America must identify  the international design application by the international registration  number or by the U.S. application number assigned to the international  design application. If an assignment of a patent application filed under  Sec.  1.53(b) of this chapter is executed concurrently with, or  subsequent to, the execution of the patent application, but before the  patent application is filed, it must identify the patent application by  the name of each inventor and the title of the invention so that there  can be no mistake as to the patent application intended. If an  assignment of a provisional application under Sec.  1.53(c) of this  chapter is executed before the provisional application is filed, it must  identify the provisional application by the name of each inventor and  the title of the invention so that there can be no mistake as to the  provisional application intended.
