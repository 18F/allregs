                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part only:</p><p class="depth0">Barge vapor connection means the point in a barge's piping system  where it connects to a vapor collection hose or arm. This may be the  same as the barge's cargo connection while controlling vapors during  tank barge cargo tank-cleaning operations.</p><p class="depth0">Cargo deck area means that part of the weather deck that is directly  over the cargo tanks.</p><p class="depth0">Cargo tank venting system means the venting system required by 46  CFR 32.55.</p><p class="depth0">Certifying entity means a certifying entity accepted by the Coast  Guard as such pursuant to 33 CFR part 154, subpart P.</p><p class="depth0">Cleaning facility means a facility used or capable of being used to  conduct cleaning operations on a tank barge.</p><p class="depth0">Cleaning operation means any stripping, gas-freeing, or tank-washing  operation of a barge's cargo tanks conducted at a cleaning facility.</p><p class="depth0">Commandant means the Commandant (CG-ENG), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 2nd  St. SW., Stop 7126, Washington, DC 20593-7126.</p><p class="depth0">Facility vapor connection means the point in a facility's fixed  vapor collection system where the system connects with the vapor  collection hose or the base of the vapor collection arm.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed stripping line means a pipe extending to the low point of each  cargo tank, which is welded through the deck and terminated above deck  with a valve, and plugged at the open end.</p><p class="depth0">Flammable liquid means a liquid as defined in 46 CFR 30.10-22.</p><p class="depth0">Fluid displacement system means a system that removes vapors from a  barge's cargo tanks during gas freeing through the addition of an inert  gas or other medium into the cargo tank.</p><p class="depth0">Fluid injection connection means the point in a fluid displacement  system at which the fixed piping or hose that supplies the inert gas or  other medium connects to a barge's cargo tanks or fixed piping system.</p><p class="depth0">Gas freeing means the removal of vapors from a tank barge.</p><p class="depth0">Independent as applied to two systems means that one system will  operate when there is a failure of any part of the other system.</p><p class="depth0">Inerted means the oxygen content of the vapor space in a cargo tank  is reduced in accordance with the inert gas requirements of 46 CFR 32.53  or 33 CFR 153.500. If a cargo vapor in a cargo tank that is connected to  the vapor collection system is defined as inerted at the start of cargo  transfer, the oxygen content in the vapor space of the cargo tank must  not exceed 60 percent by volume of the cargo's minimum oxygen  concentration for combustion, or 8 percent by volume for vapor of crude  oil, gasoline blends, or benzene.</p><p class="depth0">Marine Safety Center (MSC) means Commanding Officer, Marine Safety  Center, U.S. Coast Guard, 4200 Wilson Boulevard Suite 400, Arlington, VA  22203 for visitors.

It includes the vapor collection system and vapor processing unit or a  tank.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor processing unit means the components of a VCS that recover,  destroy, or disperse vapor collected from a vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Vessel-to-vessel transfer (direct or through a shore loop) means  either--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The transfer of a bulk liquid cargo from a tank vessel to a  service vessel; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The transfer of a bulk liquid cargo from a service vessel to  another vessel in order to load the receiving vessel to a deeper draft.</p><p class="depth2">Vessel vapor connection means the point in a vessel's fixed vapor  collection system where the system connects with the vapor collection  hose or arm.
