In order to be approved, the hydraulic releases must be tested in accordance with Sec. 160.062-4(c) by an independent laboratory accepted by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR 159.010. The independent laboratory will forward the report to the Commandant for examination, and if satisfactory an official approval number will be assigned to the manufacturer for the model hydraulic release submitted.
