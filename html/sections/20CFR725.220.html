                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of determining whether an individual may qualify for  benefits as the child of a deceased miner, the provisions of Sec.  725.208 shall be applicable. As used in this section, the term  ``beneficiary'' means only a surviving spouse entitled to benefits at  the time of such surviving spouse's death (see Sec. 725.212), or a  miner. For purposes of a survivor's claim, an individual will be  considered to be a child of a beneficiary if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The courts of the State in which such beneficiary is domiciled  (see Sec. 725.231) would find, under the law they would apply in  determining the devolution of the beneficiary's intestate personal  property, that the individual is the beneficiary's child; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such individual is the legally adopted child of such  beneficiary; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Such individual is the stepchild of such beneficiary by reason  of a valid marriage of such individual's parent or adopting parent to  such beneficiary; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Such individual does not bear the relationship of child to such  beneficiary under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, but would,  under State law, have the same right as a child to share in the  beneficiary's intestate personal property; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Such individual is the natural son or daughter of a beneficiary  but does not bear the relationship of child to such beneficiary under  paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, and is not considered to be  the child of the beneficiary under paragraph (d) of this section, such  individual shall nevertheless be considered to be the child of such  beneficiary if the beneficiary and the mother or father, as the case may  be, of such individual went through a marriage ceremony resulting in a  purported marriage between them which but for a legal impediment (see  Sec. 725.230) would have been a valid marriage; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Such individual is the natural son or daughter of a beneficiary  but does not have the relationship of child to such beneficiary under  paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, and is not considered to be  the child of the beneficiary under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section,  such individual shall nevertheless be considered to be the child of such  beneficiary if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such beneficiary, prior to his or her entitlement to benefits,  has acknowledged in writing that the individual is his or her son or  daughter, or has been decreed by a court to be the father or mother of  the individual, or has been ordered by a court to contribute to the  support of the individual (see Sec. 725.233(a)) because the individual  is a son or daughter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such beneficiary is shown by satisfactory evidence to be the  father or   mother of the individual and was living with or contributing to the  support of the individual at the time such beneficiary became entitled  to benefits.</p>
