                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual's written request for access to records about  himself which does not specify the Act under which the request is made  will be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and  the Privacy Act and the applicable regulations. Such requests will be  processed under both Acts regardless of whether the requester cites one  Act, both, or neither in the request in order to ensure the maximum  possible disclosure to the requester. Individuals may not be denied  access to a record pertaining to themselves merely because those records  are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Privacy Act request that neither specifies the system(s) of  records to be searched nor identifies the substantive nature of the  information sought will be processed by searching the systems of records  categorized as Environmental Health, Safety and Fitness, FOIA/Privacy,  General, and Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Privacy Act request that does not designate the system(s) of  records to be searched but does identify the substantive nature of the  information sought will be processed by searching those systems of  records likely to have information similar to that sought by the  requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The NRO will not disclose any record to any person or government  agency except by written request or   prior written consent of the subject of the record unless the disclosure  is required by law or is within the exceptions of the Privacy Act. If a  requester authorizes another individual to obtain the requested records  on his behalf, the requester shall provide a written, signed, notarized  statement appointing that individual as his representative and  certifying that the individual appointed may have access to the  requester's records and that such access shall not constitute an  invasion of his privacy nor a violation of his rights under the Privacy  Act. In lieu of a notarized statement, the NRO will accept a declaration  in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of a written request, the Privacy Act Coordinator  (PA Coordinator) will release to the requester those records which are  releasable and applicable to the individual making the request. Records  about individuals include data stored electronically or in electronic  media. Documentary material qualifies as a record if the record is  maintained in a system of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Initial availability, potential for release, and cost  determination will usually be made within ten working days of the date  on which a written request for any identifiable record is received by  the NRO (and acknowledgement is sent to the individual). If additional  time is needed due to unusual circumstances, a written notification of  the delay will be forwarded to the requester within the ten working day  period. This notification will briefly explain the circumstances for the  delay and indicate the anticipated date for a substantive response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All requests will be handled in the order received on a `first- in, first-out' basis. Requests will be considered for expedited  processing only if the NRO determines that there is a genuine health,  humanitarian, or due process reason involving possible deprivation of  life or liberty which creates an exceptional and urgent need, that there  is no alternative forum for the records sought, and that substantive  records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be releasable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records provided or originated by another agency or containing  other agency information will not be released prior to coordination with  the other agency involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses  is a violation of the Privacy Act and is subject to criminal penalties.</p>
