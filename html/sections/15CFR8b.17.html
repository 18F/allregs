                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or  activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in  its entirety it is readily accessible to qualified handicapped  individuals. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of  its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and  usable by qualified handicapped individuals. However, if a particular  program is available in only one location, that site must be made  accessible or the aid, benefit, or service must be made available at an  alternative accessible site or sites. Accessibility requires nonpersonal  aids to make the aid, benefit, or service accessible to mobility  impaired persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of  equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible  buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery  of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing  facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the  requirement of Sec. 8b.19, or any other method that results in making  its program or activity accessible to handicapped individuals. A  recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing  facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance  with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods  for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a  recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped  individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a small recipient finds, after consultation with a qualified  handicapped individual seeking its services, that there is no method of  complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a  significant alteration in its existing facilities or facility, the small  recipient may, as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped  individual to other providers of those services that are accessible at  no additional cost to the handicapped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of  this part. Where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such  changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this  part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of  this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the  effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps  necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the  assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or  organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition  plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a  minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that  limit the accessibility of its program or activity to qualified  handicapped individuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  full accessibility under Sec. 8b.17(a) and, if the time period of the  transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be  taken during each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to  ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision  or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of  services, activities and facilities that are accessible to and   usable by qualified handicapped individuals.
