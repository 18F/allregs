                                Sec. 1241.14  Continued detention of removable aliens on account
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides for the review of determinations by  the Department of Homeland Security to continue the detention of  particular removable aliens found to be specially dangerous. See 8 CFR  241.14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. This section applies to the review of the  continued detention of removable aliens because the Department of  Homeland Security has determined that release of the alien would pose a  special danger to the public, where there is no significant likelihood  of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. This section does not  apply to aliens who are not subject to the special review provisions  under 8 CFR 241.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Jurisdiction. The immigration judges and the Board have  jurisdiction with respect to determinations as to whether release of an  alien would pose a special danger to the public, as provided in  paragraphs (f) through (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)-(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Detention of aliens determined to be specially dangerous--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Standard for continued detention. Subject to the review procedures  provided in this section, the Service shall continue to detain an alien  if the release of the alien would pose a special danger to the public,  because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alien has previously committed one or more crimes of  violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Due to a mental condition or personality disorder and behavior  associated with that condition or disorder, the alien is likely to  engage in acts of violence in the future; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No conditions of release can reasonably be expected to ensure  the safety of the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination by the Commissioner. The Service shall promptly  initiate review proceedings under paragraph (g) of this section if the  Commissioner has determined in writing that the alien's release would  pose a special danger to the public, according to the standards of  paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Medical or mental health examination. Before making such a  determination, the Commissioner shall arrange for a report by a  physician employed or designated by the Public Health Service based on a  full medical and psychiatric examination of the alien. The report shall  include recommendations pertaining to whether, due to a mental condition  or personality disorder and behavior associated with that condition or  disorder, the alien is likely to engage in acts of violence in the  future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Detention pending review. After the Commissioner or Deputy  Commissioner has made a determination under this paragraph, the Service  shall continue to detain the alien, unless an immigration judge or the  Board issues an administratively final decision dismissing the review  proceedings under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Referral to Immigration Judge. Jurisdiction for an immigration  judge to review a determination by the Service pursuant to paragraph (f)  of this section that an alien is specially dangerous shall commence with  the filing by the Service of a Notice of Referral to the Immigration  Judge (Form I-863) with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over  the place of the alien's custody. The Service shall promptly provide to  the alien by personal service a copy of the Notice of Referral to the  Immigration Judge and all accompanying documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factual basis. The Service shall attach a written statement that  contains a summary of the basis for the Commissioner's determination to  continue to detain the alien, including a description of the evidence  relied upon to reach the determination regarding the alien's special  dangerousness. The Service shall attach copies of all relevant documents  used to reach its decision to continue to detain the alien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of reasonable cause hearing. The Service shall attach a  written notice advising the alien that the Service   is initiating proceedings for the continued detention of the alien and  informing the alien of the procedures governing the reasonable cause  hearing, as set forth at paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice of alien's rights. The Service shall also provide written  notice advising the alien of his or her rights during the reasonable  cause hearing and the merits hearing before the Immigration Court, as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alien shall be provided with a list of free legal services  providers, and may be represented by an attorney or other representative  of his or her choice in accordance with 8 CFR part 1292, at no expense  to the Government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Immigration Court shall provide an interpreter for the  alien, if necessary, for the reasonable cause hearing and the merits  hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine  evidence against the alien, to present evidence in the alien's own  behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Service; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The alien shall have the right, at the merits hearing, to  cross-examine the author of any medical or mental health reports used as  a basis for the determination under paragraph (f) of this section that  the alien is specially dangerous.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record. All proceedings before the immigration judge under this  section shall be recorded. The Immigration Court shall create a record  of proceeding that shall include all testimony and documents related to  the proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reasonable cause hearing. The immigration judge shall hold a  preliminary hearing to determine whether the evidence supporting the  Service's determination is sufficient to establish reasonable cause to  go forward with a merits hearing under paragraph (i) of this section. A  finding of reasonable cause under this section will be sufficient to  warrant the alien's continued detention pending the completion of the  review proceedings under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scheduling of hearing. The reasonable cause hearing shall be  commenced not later than 10 business days after the filing of the Form  I-863. The Immigration Court shall provide prompt notice to the alien  and to the Service of the time and place of the hearing. The hearing may  be continued at the request of the alien or his or her representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence. The Service must show that there is reasonable cause  to conduct a merits hearing under a merits hearing under paragraph (i)  of this section. The Service may offer any evidence that is material and  relevant to the proceeding. Testimony of witnesses, if any, shall be  under oath or affirmation. The alien may, but is not required to, offer  evidence on his or her own behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decision. The immigration judge shall render a decision, which  should be in summary form, within 5 business days after the close of the  record, unless that time is extended by agreement of both parties, by a  determination from the Chief Immigration Judge that exceptional  circumstances make it impractical to render the decision on a highly  expedited basis, or because of delay caused by the alien. If the  immigration judge determines that the Service has met its burden of  establishing reasonable cause, the immigration judge shall advise the  alien and the Service, and shall schedule a merits hearing under  paragraph (i) of this section to review the Service's determination that  the alien is specially dangerous. If the immigration judge determines  that the Service has not met its burden, the immigration judge shall  order that the review proceedings under this section be dismissed. The  order and any documents offered shall be included in the record of  proceedings, and may be relied upon in a subsequent merits hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appeal. If the immigration judge dismisses the review  proceedings, the Service may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals  in accordance with Sec. 1003.38 of this chapter, except that the  Service must file the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) with the Board  within 2 business days after the immigration judge's order. The Notice  of Appeal should state clearly and conspicuously that it is an appeal of  a reasonable cause decision under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Service reserves appeal of a dismissal of the reasonable  cause hearing, the immigration judge's order shall be stayed until the  expiration of the time to appeal. Upon the Service's filing of a timely  Notice of Appeal, the immigration judge's order shall remain in abeyance  pending a final decision of the appeal. The stay shall expire if the  Service fails to file a timely Notice of Appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Board will decide the Service's appeal, by single Board  Member review, based on the record of proceedings before the immigration  judge. The Board shall expedite its review as far as practicable, as the  highest priority among the appeals filed by detained aliens, and shall  determine the issue within 20 business days of the filing of the notice  of appeal, unless that time is extended by agreement of both parties, by  a determination from the Chairman of the Board that exceptional  circumstances make it impractical to render the decision on a highly  expedited basis, or because of delay caused by the alien.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the Board determines that the Service has met its burden of  showing reasonable cause under this paragraph (h), the Board shall  remand the case to the immigration judge for the scheduling of a merits  hearing under paragraph (i) of this section. If the Board determines  that the Service has not met its burden, the Board shall dismiss the  review proceedings under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Merits hearing. If there is reasonable cause to conduct a merits  hearing under this section, the immigration judge shall promptly  schedule the hearing and shall expedite the proceedings as far as  practicable. The immigration judge shall allow adequate time for the  parties to prepare for the merits hearing, but, if requested by the  alien, the hearing shall commence within 30 days. The hearing may be  continued at the request of the alien or his or her representative, or  at the request of the Service upon a showing of exceptional  circumstances by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section. The immigration judge may  receive into evidence any oral or written statement that is material and  relevant to this determination. Testimony of witnesses shall be under  oath or affirmation. The alien may, but is not required to, offer  evidence on his or her own behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors for consideration. In making any determination in a  merits hearing under this section, the immigration judge shall consider  the following non-exclusive list of factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alien's prior criminal history, particularly the nature and  seriousness of any prior crimes involving violence or threats of  violence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien's previous history of recidivism, if any, upon  release from either Service or criminal custody;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The substantiality of the Service's evidence regarding the  alien's current mental condition or personality disorder;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The likelihood that the alien will engage in acts of violence  in the future; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The nature and seriousness of the danger to the public posed by  the alien's release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decision. After the closing of the record, the immigration judge  shall render a decision as soon as practicable. The decision may be oral  or written. The decision shall state whether or not the Service has met  its burden of establishing that the alien should remain in custody  because the alien's release would pose a special danger to the public,  under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The decision  shall also include the reasons for the decision under each of the  standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, although a formal  enumeration of findings is not required. Notice of the decision shall be  served in accordance with Sec. 1240.13(a) or (b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the immigration judge determines that the Service has met its  burden, the immigration judge shall enter an order providing for the  continued detention of the alien.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the immigration judge determines that the Service has failed  to meet its burden, the immigration judge   shall order that the review proceedings under this section be dismissed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appeal. Either party may appeal an adverse decision to the Board  of Immigration Appeals in accordance with Sec. 3.38 of this chapter,  except that, if the immigration judge orders dismissal of the  proceedings, the Service shall have only 5 business days to file a  Notice of Appeal with the Board. The Notice of Appeal should state  clearly and conspicuously that this is an appeal of a merits decision  under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Service reserves appeal of a dismissal, the immigration  judge's order shall be stayed until the expiration of the time to  appeal. Upon the Service's filing of a timely Notice of Appeal, the  immigration judge's order shall remain in abeyance pending a final  decision of the appeal. The stay shall expire if the Service fails to  file a timely Notice of Appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Board shall conduct its review of the appeal as provided in  8 CFR part 3, but shall expedite its review as far as practicable, as  the highest priority among the appeals filed by detained aliens. The  decision of the Board shall be final as provided in Sec. 1003.1(d)(3)  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Release of alien upon dismissal of proceedings. If there is an  administratively final decision by the immigration judge or the Board  dismissing the review proceedings under this section upon conclusion of  the reasonable cause hearing or the merits hearing, the Service shall  promptly release the alien on conditions of supervision, as determined  by the Service, pursuant to Sec. 1241.13. The conditions of supervision  shall not be subject to review by the immigration judge or the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Subsequent review for aliens whose release would pose a special  danger to the public--(1) Periodic review. In any case where the  immigration judge or the Board has entered an order providing for the  alien to remain in custody after a merits hearing pursuant to paragraph  (i) of this section, the Service shall continue to provide an ongoing,  periodic review of the alien's continued detention, according to Sec.  1241.4 and paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alien's request for review. The alien may also request a review  of his or her custody status because of changed circumstances, as  provided in this paragraph (k). The request shall be in writing and  directed to the HQPDU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time for review. An alien may only request a review of his or  her custody status under this paragraph (k) no earlier than six months  after the last decision of the immigration judge under this section or,  if the decision was appealed, the decision of the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Showing of changed circumstances. The alien shall bear the  initial burden to establish a material change in circumstances such that  the release of the alien would no longer pose a special danger to the  public under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Review by the Service. If the Service determines, upon  consideration of the evidence submitted by the alien and other relevant  evidence, that the alien is not likely to commit future acts of violence  or that the Service will be able to impose adequate conditions of  release so that the alien will not pose a special danger to the public,  the Service shall release the alien from custody pursuant to the  procedures in Sec. 1241.13. If the Service determines that continued  detention is needed in order to protect the public, the Service shall  provide a written notice to the alien stating the basis for the  Service's determination, and provide a copy of the evidence relied upon  by the Service. The notice shall also advise the alien of the right to  move to set aside the prior review proceedings under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Motion to set aside determination in prior review proceedings.  If the Service denies the alien's request for release from custody, the  alien may file a motion with the Immigration Court that had jurisdiction  over the merits hearing to set aside the determination in the prior  review proceedings under this section. The immigration judge shall  consider any evidence submitted by the alien or relied upon by the  Service and shall provide an opportunity for the Service to respond to  the motion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless the immigration judge determines that the alien has  satisfied the requirements under paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section,  the immigration judge shall deny the motion. Neither the immigration  judge nor the Board may sua sponte set aside a determination in prior  review proceedings. Notwithstanding 8 CFR 1003.23 or 1003.2 (motions to  reopen), the provisions set forth in this paragraph (k) shall be the  only vehicle for seeking review based on material changed circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The alien may appeal an adverse decision to the Board in  accordance with Sec. 1003.38 of this chapter. The Notice of Appeal  should state clearly and conspicuously that this is an appeal of a  denial of a motion to set aside a prior determination in review  proceedings under this section.
