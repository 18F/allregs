                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents. A PTCIP filed pursuant to this subpart shall, at a  minimum, describe:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The functional requirements that the proposed system must meet;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How the PTC railroad intends to comply with Secs. 236.1009(c)  and (d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> How the PTC system will provide for interoperability of the  system between the host and all tenant railroads on the track segments  required to be equipped with PTC systems under this subpart and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include relevant provisions of agreements, executed by all  applicable railroads, in place to achieve interoperability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List all methods used to obtain interoperability; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify any railroads with respect to which interoperability  agreements have not been achieved as of the time the plan is filed, the  practical obstacles that were encountered that prevented resolution, and  the further steps planned to overcome those obstacles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How, to the extent practical, the PTC system will be implemented  to address areas of greater risk to the public and railroad employees  before areas of lesser risk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The sequence and schedule in which track segments will be  equipped and the basis for those decisions, and shall at a minimum  address the following risk factors by track segment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Segment traffic characteristics such as typical annual passenger  and freight train volume and volume of poison- or toxic-by-inhalation  (PIH or TIH) shipments (loads, residue);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Segment operational characteristics such as current method of  operation (including presence or absence of a block signal system),  number of tracks, and maximum allowable train speeds, including planned  modifications; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Route attributes bearing on risk, including ruling grades and  extreme curvature;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following information relating to rolling stock:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> What rolling stock will be equipped with PTC technology;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The schedule to equip that rolling stock by December 31, 2015;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All documents and information required by Sec. 236.1006; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Unless the tenant railroad is filing its own PTCIP, the host  railroad's PTCIP shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Attest that the host railroad has made a formal written request  to each tenant railroad requesting identification of each item of  rolling stock to be PTC system equipped and the date each will be  equipped; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Include each tenant railroad's response to the host railroad's  written request made in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(iv)(A) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The number of wayside devices required for each track segment  and the installation schedule to complete wayside equipment installation  by December 31, 2015;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Identification of each track segment on the railroad as mainline  or non-mainline track. If the PTCIP includes an MTEA, as defined by  Sec. 236.1019, the PTCIP should identify the tracks included in the MTEA  as main line track with a reference to the MTEA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To the extent the railroad determines that risk-based  prioritization required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is not  practical, the basis for this determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The dates the associated PTCDP and PTCSP, as applicable, will  be submitted to FRA in accordance with Sec. 236.1009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional Class I railroad PTCIP requirements. Each Class I  railroad shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In its PTCIP a strategy for full deployment of its PTC system,  describing the criteria that it will apply in identifying additional  rail lines on its own network, and rail lines of entities that it  controls or engages in joint operations with, for which full or partial  deployment of PTC technologies is appropriate, beyond those required to  be equipped under this subpart. Such criteria shall include  consideration of the policies established by 49 U.S.C. 20156 (railroad  safety risk reduction program), and regulations issued thereunder, as  well as non-safety business benefits that may accrue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the Technology Implementation Plan of its Risk Reduction  Program, when first required to be filed in accordance with 49 U.S.C.  20156 and any regulation promulgated thereunder, a specification of rail  lines selected for full or partial deployment of PTC under the criteria  identified in its PTCIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an  expectation or requirement that additional rail lines beyond those  required to be equipped by this subpart must be equipped or that such  lines will be equipped during the period of primary implementation  ending December 31, 2015.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As used in this paragraph, ``partial implementation'' of a PTC  system refers to use, pursuant to subpart H of this part, of technology  embedded in PTC systems that does not employ all of the functionalities  required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FRA review. Within 90 days of receipt of a PTCIP, the Associate  Administrator will approve or disapprove of the plan and notify in  writing the affected railroad or other entity. If the PTCIP is not  approved, the notification will include the plan's deficiencies. Within  30 days of receipt of that notification, the railroad or other entity  that submitted the plan shall correct all deficiencies and resubmit the  plan in accordance with Sec. 236.1009 and paragraph (a) of this section,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpart H. A railroad that elects to install a PTC system when  not required to do so may elect to proceed under this subpart or under  subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of a PTCIP, NPI, PTCDP, or PTCSP, FRA posts on its  public web site notice of receipt and reference to the public docket in  which a copy of the filing has been placed. FRA may consider any public  comment on each document to the extent practicable within the time  allowed by law and without delaying implementation of PTC systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The PTCIP shall be maintained to reflect the railroad's most  recent PTC deployment plans until all PTC system deployments required  under this subpart are complete.
