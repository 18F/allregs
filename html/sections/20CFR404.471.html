                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nonpayment of benefits during the trial work period. Beginning  with work activity performed in March 2004 and thereafter, if you are  convicted by a Federal court of fraudulently concealing your work  activity and the concealment of the work activity occurred while you  were in a trial work period, monthly disability benefits under title II  of the Social Security Act are not payable for months in which you  performed services during that trial work period prior to the conviction  (see Sec. 404.1592 for a definition of a trial work period and  services). Benefits already received for months of work activity in the  trial work period prior to the conviction and in the same period of  disability during which the fraudulently concealed work activity  occurred, will be considered an overpayment on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Concealment of work activity. You can be found to be  fraudulently concealing work activity if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You provide false information to us concerning the amount of  earnings you received or are receiving for a particular period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You received or are receiving disability benefits while engaging  in work activity under another identity (this would include working  under another social security number or a forged social security  number); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You take other actions to conceal work activity with the intent  of fraudulently obtaining benefits in excess of amounts that are due.
