                                Sec. 25.102  How is compensation for death of a non-citizen
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If the disability causes death, the compensation shall be payable in  the amount and to or for the benefit of the following persons:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To the undertaker or person entitled to reimbursement,  reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding $800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the surviving spouse, if there is no child, 30 percent of the  monthly pay until his or her death or remarriage subject to the lump sum  provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To the surviving spouse, if there is a child, the compensation  payable under paragraph (b) of this section, and in addition thereto 10  percent of the monthly wage for each child, not to exceed a total of 50  percent of the monthly pay for such surviving spouse and children  subject to the lump sum provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135. If a child has a  guardian other than the surviving spouse, the compensation payable on  account of such child shall be paid to such guardian. The compensation  entitlement of any child shall cease when he or she dies, marries or  reaches the age of 18 years, or if over such age and incapable of self- support, becomes capable of self-support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To the children, if there is no surviving spouse, 25 percent of  the monthly pay for one child and 10 percent thereof for each additional  child, not to exceed a total of 50 percent of the monthly pay thereof,  divided among such children share and share alike subject to the lump  sum provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135. The compensation entitlement of each  child shall cease when he or she dies, marries or reaches the age of 18,  or if over such age and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of  self-support. The compensation of a child under legal age shall be paid  to its guardian, if there is one, otherwise to the person having the  custody or care of such child, for such child, as the Director in his or  her discretion shall determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To the parents, if one is wholly dependent for support upon the  deceased employee at the time of his or her death and the other is not  dependent to any extent, 20 percent of the monthly pay; if both are  wholly dependent, 10 percent thereof to each; if one is or both are  partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the  Director. The compensation to a parent or parents in the percentages  specified shall be paid if there is no surviving spouse or child, but if  there is a surviving spouse or child, there shall be paid so much of  such percentages for a parent or parents as, when added to the total of  the percentages of the surviving spouse and children, will not exceed a  total of 50 percent of the   monthly pay. These payments are subject to the lump sum provision of 5  U.S.C. 8135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To the brothers, sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, if one  is wholly dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time  of his or her death, 20 percent of the monthly pay to such dependent; if  more than one are wholly dependent, 30 percent of such pay, divided  among such dependents share and share alike; if there is no one of them  wholly dependent, but one or more are partly dependent, 10 percent of  such pay divided among such dependents share and share alike. The  compensation to such beneficiaries shall be paid if there is no  surviving spouse, child or dependent parent. If there is a surviving  spouse, child or dependent parent, there shall be paid so much of the  above percentages as, when added to the total of the percentages payable  to the surviving spouse, children and dependent parents, will not exceed  a total of 50 percent of such pay. These payments are subject to the  lump sum provision of 5 U.S.C. 8135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The compensation entitlement of each beneficiary under  paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section shall be paid until he or she, if  a parent or grandparent, dies, marries or ceases to be dependent, or, if  a brother, sister or grandchild, dies, marries or reaches the age of 18  years, or if over such age and incapable of self-support, becomes  capable of self-support. The compensation of a brother, sister or  grandchild under legal age shall be paid to his or her guardian, if  there is one, otherwise to the person having the custody or care of such  person, for such person, as the Director in his or her discretion shall  determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Upon the cessation of any person's compensation for death under  this subpart, the compensation of any remaining person entitled to  continuing compensation in the same case shall remain the same so that  the continuing compensation shall be at the same rate each person  previously received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> In cases where there are two or more classes of persons entitled  to compensation for death under this subpart, and the apportionment of  such compensation as provided in this section would result in injustice,  the Director may in his or her discretion modify the apportionments to  meet the requirements of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compensation for death shall be paid where practicable in a lump  sum pursuant to section 8135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In the event a beneficiary eligible for death benefits covered  under subpart B can demonstrate that the amount payable under the  special schedule would result in a payment that would be demonstrably  less than the amount payable under the law of his home country, the  Director retains the discretion to pay that amount of compensation under  5 U.S.C. 8137(a)(2)(A), not to exceed the amount payable under FECA. To  request benefits under this paragraph, the beneficiary must submit the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Translated copies of the applicable local statute as well as any  regulations, policies and procedures the beneficiary asserts are  applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A translated copy of an opinion rendered by an attorney licensed  in that jurisdiction or an advisory opinion from a court or  administrative tribunal that explains the benefits payable to the  beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A FECA death gratuity of $65,000 may be payable for the death of  a non-citizen non-resident employee should the death be a result of  injury incurred in connection with service with an Armed Force in a  contingency operation as set forth in subpart J of part 10.</p>
