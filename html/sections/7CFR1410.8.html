Such designation must clearly define conservation and environmental objectives and provide analysis of how CRP can cost-effectively address such objectives. Generally, the total acreage of all conservation priority areas, in aggregate, shall not total more than 33 percent of the cropland in a State unless there are identified and documented extraordinary environmental needs, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As determined by the Deputy Administrator, a region shall be eligible for designation as a priority area only if the region has actual significant adverse water quality, air quality, wildlife habitat, or other natural resource impacts related to activities of agricultural production, or if the designation helps agricultural producers to comply with Federal and State environmental laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conservation priority area designations shall expire after 5 years unless re-designated, except they may be withdrawn:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the request of the appropriate State water quality agency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In those areas designated as conservation priority areas, under this section, cropland is considered eligible for enrollment according Sec. 1410.6(b)(10) based on identified environmental concerns. These concerns may include water quality, such as assisting agricultural producers to comply with nonpoint source pollution requirements, air quality, or wildlife habitat (especially for threatened and endangered species or those species that may become threatened and endangered), as determined by the Deputy Administrator.</p>
