                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The borrower must give the school the following information as part of the origination process for a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement, as described in 34 CFR part 668, that the loan will be used for the cost of the student's attendance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information demonstrating that the borrower is eligible for the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information concerning the outstanding FFEL Program and Direct Loan Program loans of the borrower and, for a parent borrower, of the student, including any Federal Consolidation Loan or Direct Consolidation Loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement authorizing the school to release to the Secretary information relevant to the student's eligibility to borrow or to have a parent borrow on the student's behalf (e.g., the student's enrollment status, financial assistance, and employment records).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The borrower must promptly notify the Secretary of any change of name, address, student status to less than half-time, employer, or employer's address; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower must promptly notify the Secretary of any change of name, address, student status to less than half-time, employer, or employer's address; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The borrower must promptly notify the school of any change in address during enrollment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Borrower defenses. (1) In any proceeding to collect on a Direct Loan, the borrower may assert as a defense against repayment, any act or omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable State law. These proceedings include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any proceeding to collect on a Direct Loan, the borrower may assert as a defense against repayment, any act or omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable State law. These proceedings include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tax refund offset proceedings under 34 CFR 30.33.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wage garnishment proceedings under section 488A of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Salary offset proceedings for Federal employees under 34 CFR part 31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Consumer reporting agency reporting proceedings under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the borrower's defense against repayment is successful, the Secretary notifies the borrower that the borrower is relieved of the obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay. The Secretary affords the borrower such further relief as the Secretary determines is appropriate under the circumstances. Further relief may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reimbursing the borrower for amounts paid toward the loan voluntarily or through enforced collection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Updating reports to consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's Direct Loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary may initiate an appropriate proceeding to require the school whose act or omission resulted in the borrower's successful defense against repayment of a Direct Loan to pay to the Secretary the amount of the loan to which the defense applies. However, the Secretary does not initiate such a proceeding after the period for the retention of records described in Sec. 685.309(c) unless the school received actual notice of the claim during that period.
