                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ninth announcement of the Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory  Board of the United States Pharmacopeia is concerned with the status of  the treatment of pernicious anemia. It clearly presents the following  facts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Sixteenth Revision of the Pharmacopeia of the United States,  which became official on October 1, 1960, does not include preparations  intended for the treatment of pernicious anemia by oral administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The U.S.P. unit for anti-anemia preparations no longer has any  significance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board was  disbanded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On the basis of the scientific evidence and conclusions  summarized in the statement of the U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations  Advisory Board as well as pertinent information from other sources, the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds it is the consensus of well  informed medical opinion that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parenteral administration of cyanocobalamin or vitamin  B12 is generally recognized as a fully effective treatment of  pernicious anemia. Parenteral cyanocobalamin preparations have not been  and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a  duly licensed medical practitioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia do not respond to  orally ingested products. There is no known way to predict which  patients will fail to respond or will cease to respond to the treatment  of pernicious anemia with orally ingested preparations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The substitution of a possibly inadequate treatment, such as the  ingestion of oral preparations of vitamin B12 with intrinsic  factor concentrate, in place of parenteral vitamin B12  products for a disease condition as serious   as pernicious anemia cannot be regarded as safe in all cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The development of the classical symptoms of pernicious anemia  that would cause a person to seek medical attention may in some cases be  delayed by oral ingestion of intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia is a  disease that is associated, among other things, with a higher than  normal incidence of cancer of the stomach and that for the safety of the  patient, requires continuous expert medical supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With inadequate treatment there may be markedly deleterious  effects on the nervous system. It is well established that whereas the  development of anemia is completely reversible with adequate treatment,  the involvement of the nervous system may not be completely reversible  and thus may result in permanent damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Some hematologists prescribe oral preparations of vitamin  B12 in the treatment of pernicious-anemia patients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate serve no known  useful therapeutic or nutritive purpose except to the extent that they  do increase the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12 in  patients with a deficiency or absence of intrinsic factor, which may  eventually lead to pernicious anemia. This conclusion does not apply to  diagnostic procedures using radioactive cyanocobalamin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Medical expertise is required for the diagnosis as well as the  management of pernicious anemia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Eleventh Edition of The National Formulary and its first  Interim Revision include monographs for oral preparations of vitamin  B12 with intrinsic factor concentrate, establish a unit of  vitamin B12 with intrinsic factor concentrate, and provide  for a National Formulary Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board to  assign the potency of such preparations. This provides for the  availability of such oral preparations, standardized within the meaning  of the broad limits characteristic of the evaluation of such  preparations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any drug that is offered for or purports to contain intrinsic  factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded as misbranded  within the meaning of section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act unless it is labeled with the statement ``Rx only.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any drug for oral ingestion intended, represented, or advertised  for the prevention or treatment of pernicious anemia or which purports  to contain any substance or mixture of substances described in paragraph  (d) of this section (other than diagnostic drugs containing radioactive  cyanocobalamin) will be regarded as misbranded under sections 502 (f)(2)  and (j) of the act unless its labeling bears a statement to the effect  that some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia may not respond to  the orally ingested product and that there is no known way to predict  which patients will respond or which patients may cease to respond to  the orally ingested products. The labeling shall also bear a statement  that periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia  patients are essential and recommended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,  intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate are regarded as food  additives. No food additive regulation nor existing extension of the  effective date of section 409 of the act authorizes these additives in  foods, including foods for special dietary uses. Any food containing  added intrinsic factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded  as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to any article  shipped within the jurisdiction of the act contrary to the provisions of  this policy statement after the 180th day following publication of this  statement in the Federal Register.  [40 FR 14033, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 67 FR 4906, Feb. 1, 2002]</p>
