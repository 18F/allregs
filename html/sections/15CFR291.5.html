All proposals will be reviewed by NIST  to assure compliance with the proposal content and other basic  provisions of this notice. Proposals which satisfy these requirements  will be designated qualified proposals; all others will be disqualified  at this phase of the evaluation and selection process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposal review and selection of finalists. NIST will appoint an  evaluation panel composed of NIST and in some   cases other federal employees to review and evaluate all qualified  proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria and values set  forth in this notice. A site visit may be required to make full  evaluation of a proposal. From the qualified proposals, a group of  finalists will be numerically ranked and recommended for award based on  this review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Award determination. The Director of the NIST, or her/his  designee, shall select awardees based on total evaluation scores,  geographic distribution, and the availability of funds. All three  factors will be considered in making an award. Upon the final award  decision, a notification will be made to each of the proposing  organizations.</p>
