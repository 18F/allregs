                                Sec. 825.124  Needed to care for a family member or covered servicemember.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The medical certification provision that an employee is needed  to care for a family member or covered servicemember encompasses both  physical and psychological care. It includes situations where, for  example, because of a serious health condition, the family member is  unable to care for his or her own basic medical, hygienic, or  nutritional needs or safety, or is unable to transport himself or  herself to the doctor. The term also includes providing psychological  comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or  parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or  home care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term also includes situations where the employee may be  needed to substitute for others who normally care for the family member  or covered servicemember, or to make arrangements for changes in care,  such as transfer to a nursing home. The employee need not be the only  individual or family member available to care for the family member or  covered servicemember.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule  necessary to care for a family member or covered servicemember includes  not only a situation where the condition of the family member or covered  servicemember itself is intermittent, but also where the employee is  only needed intermittently--such as where other care is normally  available, or care responsibilities are shared with another member of  the family or a third party. See Sec. Sec. 825.202-825.205 for rules  governing the use of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.</p>
