                                Sec. 1500.135  Summary of guidelines for determining chronic toxicity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A substance may be toxic due to a risk of a chronic hazard. (A  regulatory definition of ``toxic'' that pertains to chronic toxicity may  be found at 16 CFR 1500.3(c)(2).) The following discussions are intended  to help clarify the complex issues involved in assessing risk from  substances that may potentially cause chronic hazards and, where  possible, to describe conditions under which substances should be  considered toxic due to a risk of the specified chronic hazards. The  guidelines are not intended to be a static classification system, but  should be considered along with available data and with expert judgment.  They are not mandatory. Rather, the guidelines are intended as an aid to  manufacturers in determining whether a product subject to the FHSA  presents a chronic hazard. All default assumptions contained in the  guidelines on hazard and risk determination   are subject to replacement when alternatives which are supported by  appropriate data become available. The following are brief summaries of  more extensive discussions contained in the guidelines. Thus, the  guidelines should be consulted in conjunction with these summaries.  Copies of the guidelines may be obtained from the Office of Compliance  and Enforcement, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC  20207. (In addition to the chronic hazards discussed below, issues  relating to the chronic hazard of sensitization are discussed in 16 CFR  1500.3(c)(5).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Carcinogenicity. Substances are toxic by reason of their  potential carcinogenicity in humans when they are known or probable  human carcinogenic substances as defined below. Substances that are  possible human carcinogenic substances or for which there is no evidence  of carcinogenic effect under the following categories lack sufficient  evidence to be considered toxic by virtue of their potential  carcinogenicity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Known Human carcinogenic Substances (``sufficient evidence'' in  humans). Substances are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity when  they meet the ``sufficient evidence'' criteria of carcinogenicity from  studies in humans, which require that a causal relationship between  exposure to an agent and cancer be established. This category is similar  to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Group A, the  International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) Group 1, or the  American National Standards Institute's (ANSI) Category 1. A causal  relationship is established if one or more epidemiological  investigations that meet the following criteria show an association  between cancer and exposure to the agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No identified bias that can account for the observed association  has been found on evaluation of the evidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All possible confounding factors which could account for the  observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown  unlikely to be due to chance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Probable Human Carcinogenic Substances. Substances are also  toxic by reason of their probable carcinogenicity when they meet the  ``limited evidence'' criteria of carcinogenicity in humans or the  ``sufficient evidence'' criteria of carcinogenicity in animals described  below. This category is similar to EPA's Group B, IARC's Group 2, or  ANSI's Categories 2 and 3. Evidence derived from animal studies that has  been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. For example,  such evidence would result when there was an identified mechanism of  action for a chemical that causes cancer in animals that has been shown  not to apply to the human situation. It is reasonable, for practical  purposes, to regard an agent for which there is ``sufficient'' evidence  of carcinogenicity in animals as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to  humans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Limited evidence'' of carcinogenicity in humans. The evidence  is considered limited for establishing a causal relationship between  exposure to the agent and cancer when a causal interpretation is  credible, but chance, bias, or other confounding factors could not be  ruled out with reasonable confidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Sufficient evidence'' of carcinogenicity in animals.  Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity requires that the substance has  been tested in well-designed and -conducted studies (e.g., as conducted  by National Toxicology Program (NTP), or consistent with the Office of  Science Technology Assessment and Policy (OSTP) guidelines) and has been  found to elicit a statistically significant (p <0.05) exposure-related  increase in the incidence of malignant tumors, combined malignant and  benign tumors, or benign tumors if there is an indication of the ability  of such benign tumors to progress to malignancy:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In one or both sexes of multiple species, strains, or sites of  independent origin; or experiments using different routes of  administration or dose levels; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To an unusual degree in a single experiment (one species/strain/ sex) with regard to unusual tumor type, unusual tumor site, or early age  at onset of the tumor.    The presence of positive effects in short-term tests, dose-response  effects data, or structure-activity relationship are considered  additional evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Possible Human Carcinogenic Substance (``limited evidence''  animal carcinogen). In the absence of ``sufficient'' or ``limited''  human data, agents with ``limited'' evidence of carcinogenicity from  animal studies fall into this category. Such substances, and those that  do not fall into any other group, are not considered ``toxic.'' This  does not imply that the substances are or are not carcinogens, only that  the evidence is too uncertain to provide for a determination. This  category is similar to EPA's Group C, IARC's Group 3, or ANSI's category  4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Neurotoxicity. Substances are toxic by reason of their potential  neurotoxicity in humans when they meet the ``sufficient evidence'' or  ``limited evidence'' criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or when they  meet the ``sufficient evidence'' criteria of neurotoxicity in animals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Known Neurotoxic Substances (``sufficient evidence in humans'').  Substances are toxic by reason of their neurotoxicity and are considered  ``known neurotoxic substances'' when they meet the ``sufficient  evidence'' criteria of neurotoxicity derived from studies in humans  which require that a causal association between exposure to an agent and  neurotoxicity be established with a reasonable degree of certainty.  Substances in this category meet the definition of ``neurotoxic'' as  stated above. ``Sufficient evidence,'' derived from human studies, for a  causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity is  considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consistent pattern of neurological dysfunction is observed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The adverse effects/lesions account for the neurobehavioral  dysfunction with reasonable certainty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All identifiable bias and confounding factors are reasonably  discounted after consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance,  based on statistical analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Probable Neurotoxic Substances. Substances are also toxic by  reason of their probable neurotoxicity when they meet the ``limited  evidence'' criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or the ``sufficient  evidence'' criteria derived from animal studies. Evidence derived from  animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not  included. Such evidence would result, for example, when there was an  identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes neurotoxicity  in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Limited evidence'' of neurotoxicity in humans. The evidence  derived from human studies is considered limited for neurotoxicity when  the evidence is less than convincing, i.e., one of the criteria of  ``sufficient evidence'' of neurotoxicity for establishing a causal  association between exposure to the agent and neurotoxicity is not met,  leaving some uncertainties in establishing a causal association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Sufficient evidence'' of neurotoxicity in animals. Sufficient  evidence of neurotoxicity derived from animal studies for a causal  association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity requires  that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The substance has been tested in well-designed and -conducted  studies (e.g., NTP's neurobehavioral battery, or conforming to EPA's  neurotoxicity test guidelines); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The substance has been found to elicit a statistically  significant (p <0.05) increase in any neurotoxic effect in one or both  sexes of multiple species, strains, or experiments using different  routes of administration and dose-levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Possible Neurotoxic Substances. ``Possible neurotoxic  substances'' are the substances which meet the ``limited evidence''  criteria of neurotoxicity evidence derived from animal studies in the  absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or  data which do not fall into any other group. Substances in this category  are not considered ``toxic.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions of  ``Sufficient'' and ``Limited'' Evidence. The following definitions apply  to all categories stated below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Sufficient evidence'' from human studies for a causal  association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of  developmental or reproductive toxicity is considered to exist if the  studies meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No identified bias that can account for the observed association  has been found on evaluation of the evidence.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> All possible confounding factors which could account for the  observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown  unlikely to be due to chance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Limited evidence'' from human studies exists when the human  epidemiology meets all but one of the criteria for ``sufficient  evidence''; i.e., the statistical evidence is borderline as opposed to  clear-cut, there is a source of bias, or there are confounding factors  that have not been and cannot be accounted for.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Sufficient evidence'' from animal studies exists when</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Obtained from a good quality animal study; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The substance has been found to elicit a statistically  significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in multiple endpoints in  a single species/strain, or in the incidence of a single endpoint at  multiple dose levels or with multiple routes of administration in a  single species/strain, or increase in the incidence of a single endpoint  in multiple species/strains/ experiments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ``Limited evidence'' from animal studies exists when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Obtained from a good quality study and there is a statistically  significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in the incidence of a  single endpoint in a single species/strain/experiment at a single dose  level administered through only one route and such evidence otherwise  does not meet the criteria for ``sufficient evidence''; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The evidence is derived from studies which can be interpreted to  show positive effects but have some qualitative or quantitative  limitations with respect to experimental procedures (e.g., doses,  exposure, follow-up, number of animals/group, reporting of the data,  etc.) which would prevent classification of the evidence in the group of  ``sufficient evidence.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Developmental Toxicants. Substances are toxic by reason of their  potential developmental or reproductive toxicity when they meet the  ``sufficient evidence'' or ``limited evidence'' criteria of  developmental or reproductive toxicity in humans, or when they meet the  ``sufficient evidence'' criteria of developmental or reproductive  toxicity in animals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the  European Economic Community (EEC) have developed categories for  teratogens but not other developmental toxicants. The teratogen  guidelines limit the information only to structural birth defects and do  not include other hazards of developmental toxicity such as embryonal  death, fetal death, or functional deficiencies which are also important  in assessing the overall toxicity of a substance when administered  during pregnancy. Recently, EPA has proposed a system for classifying  developmental toxicity. The Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) has not yet developed any classification for  developmental toxicity. The commission has established the following  categories for determination of developmental toxicity according to the  available evidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Known Human Developmental Toxicant (``sufficient evidence in  humans''). A substance is considered a ``known human developmental  toxicant'' if there is ``sufficient'' human evidence to establish a  causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence  of developmental toxicity manifested by death of the conceptus (embryo  or fetus), or structural or functional birth defects. This category  (Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to category 1 of the EEC  and categories D and X of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited  to teratogens. This category is also comparable to the category  ``definitive evidence for human developmental toxicity'' proposed by  EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Probable Human Developmental Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``probable human developmental toxicant'' if there is  ``limited'' human evidence or ``sufficient'' animal evidence   to establish a causal association between human exposure and subsequent  occurrence of developmental toxicity. This group (Probable Human  Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to the category ``adequate  evidence for human developmental toxicity'' proposed by EPA. This  category is also comparable to category 2 of the EEC and category A1 of  FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possible Human Developmental Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``possible human developmental toxicant'' if there is  ``limited'' animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the  presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other  group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and  subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity. EEC, FDA, and EPA have  not developed a category comparable to this group. The Commission  believes that data from well planned animal studies are important to  consider even though they may provide only limited evidence of  developmental toxicity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Male Reproductive Toxicants. Male reproductive toxicants can be  grouped into the following different categories based on evidence  obtained from human or animal studies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Known Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``known human male reproductive toxicant'' if there is  ``sufficient'' human evidence to establish a causal association between  human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main  endpoints which are mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and  postnatal development of the conceptus. This category is comparable to  the one termed ``Known Positive'' in the EPA guidelines on male  reproductive risk assessment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``probable human male reproductive toxicant'' if there is  ``limited'' human evidence or ``sufficient'' animal evidence to  establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse  effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable  to the one termed ``Probable Positive'' in the EPA guidelines on male  reproductive risk assessment. However, the EPA category is based only on  sufficient animal evidence. CPSC believes that limited human evidence is  also sufficient for a chemical to be placed in this category.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possible Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``possible human male reproductive toxicant'' if there is  limited animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the  presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other  group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and  adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is  comparable to the one termed ``Possible Positive A'' in the EPA  guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. EPA proposes to use  either limited human or limited animal evidence data to classify a  toxicant as a ``Possible Positive A'' toxicant. As described above, CPSC  would elevate limited human evidence to the category ``Probable Human  Male Reproductive Toxicant.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Female Reproductive Toxicants. Female reproductive toxicants can  be grouped into the following different categories based on evidence  obtained from human or animal studies. EPA has proposed guidelines for  assessing female reproductive risk but has not yet proposed a specific  system for categorization of female reproductive toxicants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Known Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``known human female reproductive toxicant'' if there is  ``sufficient'' human evidence to establish a causal association between  human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function such  as mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and postnatal development of  the conceptus.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Probable Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``probable human female reproductive toxicant'' if there is  ``limited'' human evidence or ``sufficient'' animal evidence to  establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse  effects on female reproductive function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possible Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is  considered a ``possible human female reproductive toxicant'' if there is  ``limited'' animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the  presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other  group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and  adverse effects on female reproductive function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other Subjects Related to the Determination that a Substance is  Toxic. Under the FHSA, for a toxic substance to be considered hazardous,  it must not only have the potential to be hazardous but there must also  be the potential that persons are exposed to the substance, that the  substance can enter the body, and that there is a significant risk of an  adverse health effect associated with the customary handling and use of  the substance. Under these guidelines, existence of an adverse health  effect means that such exposure is above the ``acceptable daily intake''  (``ADI''). The ADI is based on the risks posed by the substance, and  whether they are acceptable under the FHSA. This section addresses those  issues by providing guidelines concerning assessment of exposure,  assessment of bioavailability, determination of acceptable risks and the  ADI to children and adults, and assessment of risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assessment of Exposure. An exposure assessment may comprise a  single exposure scenario or a distribution of exposures. Reasonably  foreseeable use, as well as accidental exposure, should be taken into  consideration when designing exposure studies. The following guidelines  should be used in the assessment of exposure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inhalation. Inhalation studies to assess exposure should be  reliable studies using direct monitoring of populations, predictions of  exposure through modeling, or surrogate data.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Direct Monitoring. Populations to be monitored should be  selected randomly to be representative of the general population, unless  the exposure of a particular subset population is the desired goal of  the assessment. The monitoring technique should be appropriate for the  health effect of interest.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Modeling. Predictions of exposure to a chemical using  mathematical models can be based on physical and chemical principles,  such as mass balance principles. Mass balance models should consider the  source strength of the product of interest, housing characteristics, and  ambient conditions likely to be encountered by the studied population.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Surrogate Data. Surrogate data should only be used when data  concerning the chemical of interest are sparse or unavailable and when  there is a reasonable assurance that the surrogate data will accurately  represent the chemical of interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Oral Ingestion. Oral ingestion studies may involve direct  monitoring of sources of chemicals as well as laboratory simulations.  The estimation of exposure from ingestion of chemicals present in  consumer products is predicted based upon estimates of use of the  product and absorption of the chemical from the gastrointestinal tract.  The following criteria should be established for laboratory simulations  to estimate exposure:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A simulant or range of simulants should be carefully selected to  mimic the possible range of conditions which occur in humans, such as  full and empty stomachs, or various saliva compositions at different  times of the day.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The mechanical action to which a product is submitted must be  chosen to represent some range of realistic conditions to which a human  may subject the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dermal Exposure. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Dermal exposure involves estimating the  amount of substance contacting the skin. This may involve experiments  measuring the amount of material leached from a product contacting a  liquid layer which interfaces with the skin, or the amount of substance  which migrates from a product (in solid or liquid form) which is in  contact with the skin.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Parameters to be considered include: Surface area of the skin  contacted, duration of contact, frequency of contact, and thickness of a  liquid interfacial layer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assessment of Bioavailability. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to consider  bioavailability in estimating the risk from use of a product containing  a toxic substance only arises when it is anticipated that the   absorption characteristics of a substance to which there is human  exposure will differ from those characteristics for the substance tested  in the studies used to define the dose-response relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the need to assess bioavailability, the factors  to be examined include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The physical or chemical form of the substance,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or through the  skin),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The presence of other constituents in the product which  interfere with or alter absorption of the toxic substance, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Dose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assessment of Risk. This section on quantitative risk assessment  applies to estimates of risk for substances that are toxic by reason of  their carcinogenicity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Generally, the study leading to the highest risk should be used  in the risk assessment; however, other factors may influence the choice  of study.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Risk should be based on the maximum likelihood estimate from a  multistage model (such as Global83 or later version) unless the maximum  likelihood estimate is not linear at low dose, in which case the 95%  upper confidence limit on risk should be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For systemic carcinogens, if estimates of human risk are made  based on animal data, a factor derived from dividing the assumed human  weight (70 kg) by the average animal weight during the study and taking  that to the \1/3\ power should be used. There is the possibility that  this factor may be changed, using the \1/4\ power instead of the \1/3\  power, as part of a unified Federal regulatory approach. If such an  approach is adopted, it will apply here.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When dose is expressed as parts per million, and the carcinogen  acts at the site of contact, humans and animals exposed to the same  amount for the same proportion of lifetime should be assumed to be  equally sensitive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If no experimental study having the same route of exposure as  that anticipated for human use of a substance is available, a study by  another route of exposure may be used. Pharmacokinetic methods may be  used if sufficient data are available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When exposure scenarios are different from those used in the  underlying study upon which estimates of risk are based, proportionality  should be applied. If pharmacokinetic methods are used to adjust for  risks at high versus low exposure levels, level-time measures should not  be combined without taking the non-linearity into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acceptable Risks--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ADI for Carcinogens. The maximum  acceptable daily intake (``ADI'') is that exposure of a toxic (by virtue  of its carcinogenicity) substance that is estimated to lead to a  lifetime excess risk of one in a million. Exposure refers to the  anticipated exposure from normal lifetime use of the product, including  use as a child as well as use as an adult.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ADI for Neurotoxicological and Developmental/Reproductive  Agents. Due to the difficulties in using a numerical risk assessment  method to determine risk for neurotoxicological or developmental/ reproductive toxicants, the Commission is using a safety factor  approach, as explained below.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Human Data. If the hazard is ascertained from human data, a  safety factor of ten will be applied to the lowest No Observed Effect  Level (``NOEL'') seen among the relevant studies. If no NOEL can be  determined, a safety factor of 100 will be applied to the Lowest  Observed Effect Level (``LOEL''). Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in  terms of daily dose level.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Animal Data. If the hazard is ascertained from animal data, a  safety factor of one hundred will be applied to the lowest NOEL. If no  NOEL can be determined, a safety factor of one thousand will be applied  to the lowest LOEL. Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in terms of daily  dose level.  [57 FR 46665, Oct. 9, 1992]</p>
