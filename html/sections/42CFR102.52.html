This documentation must demonstrate that the source of the vaccinia was an individual described in Sec.  102.3(x)(1)-(3) (a person meeting the definition of a smallpox vaccine recipient, except for the requirement that the person sustained a covered injury) or an individual who was accidentally inoculated by an individual described in Sec.  102.3(x)(1)-(3) (a person meeting the definition of a smallpox vaccine recipient, except for the requirement that the person sustained a covered injury). If the requester is unable to provide the identity of the person who was the source of the accidental exposure, he or

she must explain in writing both why this criterion cannot be met and the circumstances of the accidental vaccinia inoculation that support an individual described above as the source of the accidental vaccinia inoculation. The Secretary has the discretion to accept the requester's statement as evidence of the requester's source of exposure; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medical records sufficient to demonstrate that the requester contracted vaccinia during the effective period of the Declaration (or within 30 days thereafter) and sustained a covered injury, as described in Sec.  102.3(g), in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  102.50. These records must be consistent with the requester contracting vaccinia after the accidental vaccinia inoculation described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
