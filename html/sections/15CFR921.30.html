                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Under Secretary may designate an area proposed for designation by the Governor of the state in which it is located, as a National Esturaine Research Reserve if the Under Secretary finds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The area is a representative estuarine ecosystem that is suitable for long-term research and contributes to the biogeographical and typological balance of the System;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Key land and water areas of the proposed Reserve, as identified in the management plan, are under adequate state control sufficient to provide long-term protection for reserve resources to ensure a stable environment for research;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Designation of the area as a Reserve will serve to enhance public awareness and understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A final management plan has been approved by NOAA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An MOU has been signed between the state and NOAA ensuring a long-term commitment by the state to the effective operation and implementation of the area as a National Estuarine Research Reserve;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All MOU's necessary for reserve management (i.e., with relevant Federal, state, and local agencies and/or private organizations) have been signed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The coastal state in which the area is located has complied with the requirements of subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NOAA will determine whether the designation of a National Estuarine Research Reserve in a state with a federally approved coastal zone management program directly affects the coastal zone. If the designation is found to directly affect the coastal zone, NOAA will make a consistency determination pursuant to Sec. 307(c)(1) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1456, and 15 CFR part 930, subpart C. See Sec. 921.4(b). The results of this consistency determination will be published in the Federal Register when the notice of designation is published. See Sec. 921.30(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NOAA will publish the notice of designation of a National Estuarine Research Reserve in the Federal Register. The state shall be responsible for having a similar notice published in the local media.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term state control in Sec. 921.30(a)(3) does not necessarily require that key land and water areas be owned by the state in fee simple. Acquisition of less-than-fee simple interests e.g., conservation easements) and utilization of existing state regulatory measures are encouraged where the state can demonstrate that these interests and measures assure adequate long-term state control consistent with the purposes of the research reserve (see also Sec. Sec. 921.13(a)(7); 921.21(g)). Should the state later elect to purchase an interest in such lands using NOAA funds, adequate justification as to the need for such acquisition must be provided to NOAA.</p>
