                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What elements apply to operating personnel? Training provided under this subpart for any locomotive engineer or other person who participates in the operation of a train in train control territory must be defined in the PSP and the following elements must be addressed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Familiarization with train control equipment onboard the locomotive and the functioning of that equipment as part of the system and in relation to other onboard systems under that person's control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any actions required of the onboard personnel to enable, or enter data to, the system, such as consist data, and the role of that function in the safe operation of the train;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sequencing of interventions by the system, including pre-enforcement notification, enforcement notification, penalty application initiation and post-penalty application procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Railroad operating rules applicable to the train control system, including provisions for movement and protection of any unequipped trains, or trains with failed or cut-out train control onboard systems and other on-track equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Means to detect deviations from proper functioning of onboard train control equipment and instructions regarding the actions to be taken with respect to control of the train and notification of designated railroad personnel; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Information needed to prevent unintentional interference with the proper functioning of onboard train control equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How must locomotive engineer training be conducted? Training required under this subpart for a locomotive engineer, together with required records, must be integrated into the program of training required by part 240 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What requirements apply to full automatic operation? The following special requirements apply in the event a

train control system is used to effect full automatic operation of the train:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PSP must identify all safety hazards to be mitigated by the locomotive engineer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PSP must address and describe the training required with provisions for the maintenance of skills proficiency. As a minimum, the training program must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As described in Sec. 236.923(a)(2), develop failure scenarios which incorporate the safety hazards identified in the PSP, including the return of train operations to a fully manual mode;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide training, consistent with Sec. 236.923(a), for safe train operations under all failure scenarios and identified safety hazards that affect train operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide training, consistent with Sec. 236.923(a), for safe train operations under manual control; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Consistent with Sec. 236.923(a), ensure maintenance of manual train operating skills by requiring manual starting and stopping of the train for an appropriate number of trips and by one or more of the following methods:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Manual operation of a train for a 4-hour work period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Simulated manual operation of a train for a minimum of 4 hours in a Type I simulator as required; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Other means as determined following consultation between the railroad and designated representatives of the affected employees and approved by the FRA. The PSP must designate the appropriate frequency when manual operation, starting, and stopping must be conducted, and the appropriate frequency of simulated manual operation.</p>
