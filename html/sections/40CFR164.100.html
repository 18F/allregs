                                Sec. 164.100  Appeals from or review of interlocutory orders or rulings.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided herein, appeals as a matter of right shall lie to the Environmental Appeals Board only from an initial or accelerated decision of the Administrative Law Judge. Appeals from other orders or rulings shall, except as provided in this section, lie only if the Administrative Law Judge certifies such orders or rulings for appeal, or otherwise as provided. The Administrative Law Judge may certify an order or ruling for appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board when: (a) The order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and (b) either (1) an immediate appeal from the order and ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or (2) review after the final judgment is issued will be inadequate or ineffective. The Administrative Law Judge shall certify orders or rulings for appeal only upon the request of a party. If the Environmental Appeals Board determines that certification was improvidently granted, or takes no action within thirty (30) days of the certification, the appeal shall be deemed dismissed. When an order or ruling is not certified by the Administrative Law Judge, it shall be reviewed by the Environmental Appeals Board only upon appeal from the initial or accelerated decision except when the Environmental Appeals

Board determines, upon request of a party and in exceptional circumstances, that delaying review would be deleterious to vital public or private interests. Except in extraordinary circumstances proceedings will not be stayed pending an interlocutory appeal; where a stay is granted, a stay of more than 30 days must be approved by the Environmental Appeals Board. Ordinarily, the interlocutory appeal will be decided on the basis of the submission made to the Administrative Law Judge, but the Environmental Appeals Board may allow further briefs and oral argument.
