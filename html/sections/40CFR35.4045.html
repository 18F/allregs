However, a group that was previously incorporated as a nonprofit organization and includes all individuals and groups who joined in applying for the TAG is not required to reincorporate for the specific purpose of representing affected individuals at the site, if in EPA's discretionary judgment, the group has a history of involvement at the site. You must also:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time of award, demonstrate that your group has incorporated as a nonprofit organization or

filed the necessary documents for incorporation with the appropriate State agency; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the time of your first request for reimbursement or advance payment, submit proof that the State has incorporated your group as a nonprofit organization.</p>
