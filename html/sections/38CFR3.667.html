                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pension or compensation may be paid from a child's  18th birthday based upon school attendance if the child was at that time  pursing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution  and a claim for such benefits is filed within 1 year from the child's  18th birthday.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pension or compensation based upon a course of instruction at an  approved educational institution which was begun after a child's 18th  birthday may be paid from the commencement of the course if a claim is  filed within 1 year from that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An initial award of DIC (dependency and indemnity compensation)  to a child in the child's own right is payable from the first day of the  month in which the child attains age 18 if the   child was pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational  institution on the child's 18th birthday, and if a claim for benefits is  filed within 1 year from the child's 18th birthday. In the case of a  child who attains age 18 after September 30, 1981, if the child was,  immediately before attaining age 18, counted under 38 U.S.C. 1311(b) for  the purpose of determining the amount of DIC payable to the surviving  spouse, the effective date of an award of DIC to the child shall be the  date the child attains age 18 if a claim for DIC is filed within 1 year  from that date.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An initial award of dependency and indemnity compensation to a  child in its own right based upon a course of instruction at an approved  educational institution which was begun after the child's 18th birthday  may be paid from the first day of the month in which the course  commenced if a claim is filed within 1 year from that date.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where a child was receiving dependency and indemnity  compensation in its own right prior to age 18, payments may be continued  from the 18th birthday if the child was then attending an approved  educational institution and evidence of such school attendance is  received within 1 year from the 18th birthday. Where the child was  receiving dependency and indemnity compensation in its own right prior  to age 18 and was not attending an approved educational institution on  the 18th birthday but commences attendance at an approved educational  institution after the 18th birthday, payments may be resumed from the  commencing date of the course if evidence of such school attendance is  filed within 1 year from that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vacation periods. A child is considered to be in school during a  vacation or other holiday period if he or she was attending an approved  educational institution at the end of the preceding school term and  resumes attendance, either in the same or a different approved  educational institution, at the beginning of the next term. If an award  has been made covering a vacation period, and the child fails to  commence or resume school attendance, benefits will be terminated the  date of last payment or the last day of the month preceding the date of  failure to pursue the course, whichever is the earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ending dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, benefits may be authorized through the last day of the month in  which a course was or will be completed.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(7))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfers to other schools. When benefits have been authorized  based upon school attendance and it is shown that during a part or all  of that period the child was pursuing a different course in the same  approved educational institution or a course in a different approved  educational institution, payments previously made will not be disturbed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Accrued benefits only. When a claim for accrued benefits is  filed by or on behalf of a veteran's child over 18 but under 23 years of  age, who was pursuing a course of instruction at the time of the payee's  death and payment of accrued benefits only is involved, evidence of  school attendance need not be confirmed by the school. When the payee's  death occurred during a school vacation period, the requirements will be  considered to have been met if the child was carried on the school rolls  on the last day of the regular school term immediately preceding the  date of the payee's death.
