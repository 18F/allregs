                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves out of a demonstration area, the enrollment of the eligible beneficiary and all family members will be terminated. If an enrolled eligible beneficiary moves to an area located within a demonstration area, he or she will continue to be eligible to participate in the demonstration project. If the eligible beneficiary was enrolled prior to the move in an HMO that does not serve the new demonstration area, the eligible beneficiary will have an opportunity to select a new health plan offered by a carrier participating in the demonstration project in the new area. If the eligible beneficiary was enrolled in a fee-for-service plan prior to the move and moves to another area that is within an existing demonstration area, the eligible beneficiary can maintain his or her current coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an enrolled eligible beneficiary disenrolls, cancels, or terminates enrollment for any reason, he or she will not be eligible to reenroll in the demonstration project. Once coverage ends, eligible beneficiaries and all family members have the right to resume all of the benefits to which they are entitled to under title 10 of the United States Code. Medicare-covered eligible beneficiaries and their eligible family members who had Medigap policies prior to their enrollment in the demonstration project are entitled to reinstate that coverage under the conditions stated in section 1108(l) of title 10, United States Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible beneficiaries and their family members are eligible for Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC)

under the conditions and for the durations described in subpart K or until the end of the demonstration project, whichever occurs first. The effective date of TCC for eligible beneficiaries or their eligible family members will be the day after other coverage under this subpart ends. Eligible beneficiaries or their eligible family members selecting TCC must enroll in a health plan offered by a carrier participating in the demonstration project. If an eligible beneficiary or eligible family member enrolled in DoD TCC moves from a demonstration project area, coverage ends. DoD TCC enrollees will be responsible for paying the entire DoD premium rate (OPM's approved net-to-carrier DoD rate plus 4 percent for contingency and administration reserves) plus 2 percent of this premium rate for administration of the program. DoD will make arrangements to collect premiums plus the 2 percent administrative charge from eligible beneficiaries and forward them to OPM's Employees Health Benefits Fund. OPM will establish procedures for receiving the 2 percent administrative payment into the Employees Health Benefits Fund and making this amount available to DoD for administration of the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enrolled eligible beneficiaries are not eligible for the temporary extension of coverage and conversion opportunities described in subpart D of this part.</p>
