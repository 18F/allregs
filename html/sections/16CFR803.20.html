                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Persons and individuals subject to request. Pursuant to section 7A(e)(1), the submission of additional information or documentary material relevant to the acquisition may be required from one or more persons required to file notification, and, with respect to each such person, from one or more entities included therein, or from one or more officers, directors, partners, agents, or employees thereof, if so required by the same request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons and individuals subject to request. Pursuant to section 7A(e)(1), the submission of additional information or documentary material relevant to the acquisition may be required from one or more persons required to file notification, and, with respect to each such person, from one or more entities included therein, or from one or more officers, directors, partners, agents, or employees thereof, if so required by the same request.</p><p class="depth3">Example: A request for additional information may require a corporation and, in addition, a named officer or employee to provide certain information or documents, if both the corporation and the officer or employee are named in the same request. See subparagraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All the information and documentary material required to be submitted pursuant to a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be supplied to the Commission or to the Assistant Attorney General, whichever made such request, at such location as may be designated in the request, or, if no such location is designated, at the office designated in Sec. 803.10(c). If such request is not fully complied with, a statement of reasons for noncompliance pursuant to Sec. 803.3 shall be provided for each item or portion of such request which is not fully complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Who may require submission. A request for additional information or documentary material with respect to an acquisition may be issued by the Federal Trade Commission or its designee, or by the Assistant Attorney General or his or her designee, but not by both to the same person, any entities included therein, or any officers, directors, partners, agents, or employees of that person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Who may require submission. A request for additional information or documentary material with respect to an acquisition may be issued by the Federal Trade Commission or its designee, or by the Assistant Attorney General or his or her designee, but not by both to the same person, any entities included therein, or any officers, directors, partners, agents, or employees of that person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When request effective. A request for additional information or documentary material shall be effective--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a written request, upon receipt of the request by the ultimate parent entity of the person to which the request is directed (or, if another entity included within the person filed notification pursuant to Sec. 803.2(a), then by such entity), within the original 30-day (or, in the case of a cash tender offer or of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), 15-day) waiting period (or, if Sec. 802.23 applies, such other period as that section provides); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a written request, upon notice of the issuance of such request to the person to which it is directed within the original 30-day (or, in the case of a cash tender offer or of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), 15-day) waiting period (or, if Sec. 802.23 applies, such other period as that section provides), provided that written confirmation of the request is mailed to the person to which the request is directed within the original 30-day (or, in the case of a cash tender offer or of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), 15-day) waiting period (or, if Sec. 802.23 applies, such other period as that section provides). Notice to the person to which the request is directed may be given by telephone or in person. The person filing notification shall keep a designated individual reasonably available during normal business hours throughout the waiting period at the

telephone number supplied in the Notification and Report Form. Notice of a request for additional information or documentary material need be given by telephone only to that individual or to the individual designated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Upon the request of the individual receiving notice of the issuance of such a request, the full text of the request will be read. The written confirmation of the request shall be mailed to the ultimate parent entity of the person filing notification, or if another entity within the person filed notification pursuant to Sec. 803.2(a), then to such entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the individual designated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not located in the United States, the person filing notification shall designate an additional individual located within the United States to be reasonably available during normal business hours throughout the waiting period through a telephone number supplied on the certification page of the Notification and Report Form. This individual shall be designated for the limited purpose of receiving notification of the issuance of requests for additional information or documentary material in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests to natural persons. A request addressed to an individual, requiring that he or she submit additional information or documentary material, shall be transmitted to the person filing notification of which the individual is an ultimate parent entity, officer, director, partner, agent or employee, and shall be effective as to that individual when effective as to the person filing notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A written copy of the request shall also be delivered to the individual by hand, or by registered or certified mail at his or her home or business address.</p><p class="depth3">Example: A designee of the Federal Trade Commission sends, by certified letter which is received within the 30-day waiting period, a written request for additional information to corporation W, the ultimate parent entity within a person which filed notification. The request is effective under clause (b)(2)(i). If the letter also addressed a request for documentary material to the secretary of corporation W, a named individual, under paragraph (b)(3), the request would likewise be effective as to the individual upon receipt of the letter by W. In the latter case, the Federal Trade Commission also would send a copy of the request to the Secretary of the corporation at his or her home or business address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiting period extended. (1) During the time period when a request for additional information or documentary material remains outstanding to any person other than either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the time period when a request for additional information or documentary material remains outstanding to any person other than either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a tender offer, the person whose voting securities are sought to be acquired by the tender offeror (or any officer, director, partner, agent or employee thereof), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), the acquired person, the waiting period shall remain in effect, even though the waiting period would have expired (see Sec. 803.10(b)) if no such request had been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for additional information or documentary material to any person other than either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a tender offer, the person whose voting securities are being acquired pursuant to the tender offer (or any officer, director, partner, agent or employee thereof), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), the acquired person, shall in every instance extend the waiting period for a period of 30 (or, in the case of a cash tender offer or of an acquisition covered by 11 U.S.C. 363(b), 10) calendar days from the date of receipt (as determined under Sec. 803.10) of the additional information or documentary material requested.</p><p class="depth4">Example: Acquiring person ``A'' makes a non-cash tender offer for voting securities of corporation ``X'', and files notification. Under Sec. 801.30, the waiting period begins upon filing by ``A,'' and ``X'' must file within 15 days thereafter (10 days if it were a cash tender offer). Assume that before the end of the waiting period, the Assistant Attorney General issues a request for additional information to ``A'' and ``X.'' Since the transaction is a non-cash tender offer, the waiting period is extended for 30 days (10 days if it were a cash tender offer) beyond the date on which ``A'' responds. Note that under Sec. 803.21, even though the waiting period is not affected by the second request to ``X'' or by ``X'' supplying the requested information, ``X'' is obliged to respond to the request within a reasonable time. Nevertheless, the Federal

Trade Commission and Assistant Attorney General could, notwithstanding the pendency of the request for additional information, terminate the waiting period sua sponte pursuant to Sec. 803.11(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Identification of requests. Every request for additional information or documentary material shall be clearly identified as such, whether communicated in person, by telephone or in writing, and shall clearly identify the person, entity or entities, or individual(s) to which it is addressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of requests. Every request for additional information or documentary material shall be clearly identified as such, whether communicated in person, by telephone or in writing, and shall clearly identify the person, entity or entities, or individual(s) to which it is addressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request for clarification. No request for clarification or amplification of a response to any item on the Notification and Report Form, whether communicated in person, by telephone or in writing, shall be considered a request for additional information or documentary material within the meaning of section 7A(e) and this section.
