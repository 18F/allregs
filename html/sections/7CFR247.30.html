                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What happens if a State or local agency misuses program funds?  If FNS determines that a State or local agency has misused program funds  through negligence, fraud, theft, embezzlement, or other causes, FNS  must initiate and pursue a claim against the State agency to repay the  amount of the misused funds. The State agency will be given the  opportunity to contest the claim. The State agency is responsible for  initiating and pursuing claims against subdistributing and local  agencies if they misuse program funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What happens if a State or local agency misuses program  commodities? If a State or local agency misuses program commodities, FNS  must initiate a claim against the State agency to recover the value of  the misused commodities. The procedures for pursuing claims resulting  from misuse of commodities are detailed in Sec. 250.15(c) of this  chapter. Misused commodities include commodities improperly distributed  or lost, spoiled, stolen, or damaged as a result of improper storage,  care, or handling. The State agency is responsible for initiating and  pursuing claims against subdistributing agencies, local agencies, or  other agencies or organizations if they misuse program commodities. The  State agency must use funds recovered as a result of claims for  commodity losses in accordance with Sec. 250.15(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What happens if a participant improperly receives or uses CSFP  benefits through fraud? The State agency must ensure that a local agency  initiates a claim against a participant to recover the value of CSFP  commodities improperly received or used if the local agency determines  that the participant or caretaker of the participant fraudulently  received or used the commodities. For purposes of this program, fraud  includes intentionally making false or misleading statements, or  intentionally withholding information, to obtain CSFP commodities, or  the selling or exchange of CSFP commodities for non-food items. The  local agency must advise the participant of the opportunity to appeal  the claim through the fair hearing process, in accordance with  Sec. 247.33(a). The local agency must also disqualify the participant  from CSFP for a period of up to one year, unless the local agency  determines that disqualification would result in a serious health risk,  in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 247.20(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What procedures must be used in pursuing claims against  participants? The State agency must establish standards,   based on a cost-benefit review, for determining when the pursuit of a  claim is cost-effective, and must ensure that local agencies use these  standards in determining if a claim is to be pursued. In pursuing a  claim against a participant, the local agency must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issue a letter demanding repayment for the value of the  commodities improperly received or used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If repayment is not made in a timely manner, take additional  collection actions that are cost-effective, in accordance with the  standards established by the State agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain all records regarding claims actions taken against  participants, in accordance with Sec. 247.29.
