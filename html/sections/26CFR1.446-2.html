                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section provides rules for  determining the amount of interest that accrues during an accrual period  (other than interest described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and  for determining the portion of a payment that consists of accrued  interest. For purposes of this section, interest includes original issue  discount and amounts treated as interest (whether stated or unstated) in  any lending or deferred payment transaction. Accrued interest determined  under this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the  taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the  cash receipts and disbursements method). Application of an exception  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to one party to a  transaction does not affect   the application of this section to any other party to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest included or deducted under certain  other provisions. This section does not apply to interest that is taken  into account under--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sections 1272(a), 1275, and 163(e) (income and deductions  relating to original issue discount);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 467(a)(2) (certain payments for the use of property or  services);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sections 1276 through 1278 (market discount);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sections 1281 through 1283 (discount on certain short-term  obligations);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Section 7872(a) (certain loans with below-market interest  rates); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Section 1.1272-3 (an election by a holder to treat all interest  on a debt instrument as original issue discount).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> De minimis original issue discount. This section does not apply  to de minimis original issue discount (other than de minimis original  issue discount treated as qualified stated interest) as determined under  Sec. 1.1273-1(d). See Sec. 1.163-7 for the treatment of de minimis  original issue discount by the issuer and Secs. 1.1273-1(d) and 1.1272-3  for the treatment of de minimis original issue discount by the holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accrual of qualified stated interest. Qualified stated interest  (as defined in Sec. 1.1273-1(c)) accrues ratably over the accrual period  (or periods) to which it is attributable and accrues at the stated rate  for the period (or periods).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accrual of interest other than qualified stated interest.  Subject to the modifications in paragraph (d) of this section, the  amount of interest (other than qualified stated interest) that accrues  for any accrual period is determined under rules similar to those in the  regulations under sections 1272 and 1275 for the accrual of original  issue discount. The preceding sentence applies regardless of any  contrary formula agreed to by the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Modifications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issue price. The issue price of the loan or  contract is equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> or (ii), whichever is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a contract for the sale or exchange of property  to which section 483 does not apply, the stated principal amount; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In any other case, the amount loaned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Principal payments that are not deferred payments. In the case  of a contract to which section 483 applies, principal payments that are  not deferred payments are ignored for purposes of determining yield and  adjusted issue price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allocation of interest to payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of this section, each  payment under a loan (other than payments of additional interest or  similar charges provided with respect to amounts that are not paid when  due) is treated as a payment of interest to the extent of the accrued  and unpaid interest determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section as of the date the payment becomes due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>,  the payment is treated by the borrower as a payment of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation respected in certain small transactions. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pro rata prepayments. Accrued but unpaid interest is allocated  to a pro rata prepayment under rules similar to those for allocating  accrued but unpaid original issue discount to a pro rata prepayment  under Sec. 1.1275-2(f). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a pro  rata prepayment is a payment that is made prior to maturity that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is not made pursuant to the contract's payment schedule; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each payment  remaining to be paid on the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Aggregation rule. For purposes of this section, all contracts  calling for deferred payments arising from the same transaction (or a  series of related transactions) are treated as a single contract. This  rule, however, generally only applies to contracts involving a single  borrower and a single lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S.  dollar. This section applies to a debt instrument   that provides for all payments denominated in, or determined by  reference to, the functional currency of the taxpayer or qualified  business unit of the taxpayer (even if that currency is other than the  U.S. dollar). See Sec. 1.988-2(b) to determine interest income or  expense for debt instruments that provide for payments denominated in,  or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. On July 1, 1996, A sells his personal residence to B for a stated  purchase price of $1,297,143.66. The property is not personal use  property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of B.  Under the loan agreement, B is required to make two installment payments  of $648,571.83 each, the first due on June 30, 1998, and the second due  on June 30, 2000. Both A and B use the cash receipts and disbursements  method of accounting and use a calendar year for their taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of unstated interest. Under section 483, the agreement  does not provide for adequate stated interest. Thus, the loan's yield is  the test rate of interest determined under Sec. 1.483-3. Assume that  both A and B use annual accrual periods and that the test rate of  interest is 9.2 percent, compounded annually. Under Sec. 1.483-2, the  present value of the deferred payments is $1,000,000. Thus, the  agreement has unstated interest of $297,143.66.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> First two accrual periods. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, the issue price at the beginning of the first accrual period is  $1,000,000 (the amount described in Sec. 1.483-2(a)(1)(i)). Under  paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of interest that accrues for  the first accrual period is $92,000 ($1,000,000x.092) and the amount of  interest that accrues for the second accrual period is $100,464  ($1,092,000x.092). Thus, $192,464 of interest has accrued as of the end  of the second accrual period. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section,  the $648,571.83 payment made on June 30, 1998, is treated first as a  payment of interest to the extent of $192,464. The remainder of the  payment ($456,107.83) is treated as a payment of principal. Both A and B  take the payment of interest ($192,464) into account in 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Second two accrual periods. The adjusted issue price at the  beginning of the third accrual period is $543,892.17  ($1,092,000+$100,464-$648,571.83). The amount of interest that accrues  for the third accrual period is $50,038.08 ($543,892.17x.092) and the  amount of interest that accrues for the final accrual period is  $54,641.58, the excess of the amount payable at maturity ($648,571.83),  over the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period  ($593,930.25). As of the date the second payment becomes due,  $104,679.66 of interest has accrued. Thus, of the $648,571.83 payment  made on June 30, 2000, $104,679.66 is treated as interest and  $543,892.17 is treated as principal. Both A and B take the payment of  interest ($104,679.66) into account in 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date. This section applies to debt instruments issued  on or after April 4, 1994, and to lending transactions, sales, and  exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may  rely on this section for debt instruments issued after December 21,  1992, and before April 4, 1994, and for lending transactions, sales, and  exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.
