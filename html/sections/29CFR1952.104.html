                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with Section 18(e) of the Act and procedures in 29 CFR Part 1902, and after determination that the state met the ``fully effective'' compliance staffing benchmarks as revised in 1994 in response to a court order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in AFL-CIO v. Marshall, (C.A. No. 74-406), and was satisfactorily providing reports to OSHA through participation in the Federal-state Integrated Management Information System, the Assistant Secretary evaluated actual operations under the Oregon State Plan for a period of at least one year following certification of completion of developmental steps. Based on an 18(e) Evaluation Report covering the period October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, and after opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Secretary determined that, in operation, Oregon's occupational safety and health program (with the exception of temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging) is at least as effective as the Federal program in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment and meets the criteria for final state plan approval in Section 18(e) of the Act and implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1902. Accordingly, under Section 18(e) of the Act, the Oregon State Plan was granted final approval and concurrent Federal enforcement authority

was relinquished for all worksites covered by the plan (with the exception of temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging), effective May 12, 2005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise noted, the plan which has received final approval covers all activities of employers and all places of employment in Oregon. The plan does not cover private sector establishments on Indian reservations and tribal trust lands, including tribal and Indian-owned enterprises; employment at Crater Lake National Park; employment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Albany Research Center (ARC); Federal agencies; the U.S. Postal Service and its contractors; contractors on U.S. military reservations, except those working on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam construction projects; and private sector maritime employment on or adjacent to navigable waters, including shipyard operations and marine terminals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oregon is required to maintain a state program which is at least as effective as operations under the Federal program; to submit plan supplements in accordance with 29 CFR part 1953; to allocate sufficient safety and health enforcement staff to meet the benchmarks for state staffing established by the U.S. Department of Labor, or any revisions to those benchmarks; and, to furnish such reports in such form as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
