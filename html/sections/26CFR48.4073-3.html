                                Sec. 48.4073-3  Exemption of tread rubber used for recapping nonhighway
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sold direct by manufacturer for nontaxable use. The tax does not  apply to the sale of tread rubber by the manufacturer to any person for  use by that person otherwise than in the recapping or retreading of  tires of the type used on highway vehicles. In determining whether tread  rubber is sold for a taxable or nontaxable use, the type of vehicle on  which the recapped or retreaded tire is to be used, or the actual or  intended use of the recapped or retreaded tire, is immaterial. The  controlling factor is whether the tire resulting from the recapping or  retreading is of a type that is used otherwise than on a highway  vehicle. For definition of ``tires of the type used on highway  vehicles'', see paragraph (c) of Sec. 48.4072-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence required to establish exemption. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To establish the  right to sell tread rubber tax free under section 4073(c), the  manufacturer must obtain from the purchaser and retain in its possession  a properly executed exemption certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where only occasional sales of tread rubber for exempt use are  made to a purchaser, a separate exemption certificate should be  furnished for each   order. However, where sales are regularly and frequently made to a  purchaser for exempt use, a certificate covering all purchases during  the period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable. The  certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to  tax-free sales must be kept for inspection by the district director as  provided in section 6001 and the regulations in subpart Q.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acceptable form of exemption certificate. The following form of  exemption certificate is acceptable for the purposes of this section and  must be adhered to in substance:</p><p class="depth2">Exemption Certificate</p><p class="depth2">(For use by persons who purchase tread rubber from the manufacturer,  producer, or importer thereof for use otherwise than in recapping or  retreading tires of the type used on highway vehicles (section 4073(c)  of the Internal Revenue Code).)  (Date) ------------------------, 19----</p><p class="depth2">I, the undersigned, certify that I am the purchaser, or the (Title)  ------ of (Name of purchaser if other than the undersigned) ----------  who is the purchaser of: ---- The tread rubber specified in the  accompanying order or contract, or ---- All tread rubber specified in  contracts or orders entered into or placed with (Name of seller) ------  for the period commencing ------ and ending ------ (period not to exceed  12 calendar quarters), and that such tread rubber will not be used in  the recapping or retreading of tires of the type used on highway  vehicles, but will be used for the following purposes:  ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">The undersigned understands that if the tread rubber is used for the  recapping or retreading of tires of the type used on highway vehicles,  or is sold or otherwise disposed of, such fact must be promptly reported  to the manufacturer. The undersigned also understands that the  fraudulent use of this certificate for the purpose of securing this  exemption will subject the undersigned or any other party making such  fraudulent use to a fine of not more than $10,000, or to imprisonment  for not more than 5 years, or both, together with costs of prosecution.  The purchaser also understands that the purchaser must be prepared to  establish by satisfactory evidence the purpose for which the tread  rubber was used.  (Signature)_____________________________________________________________ (Address)_______________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption certificate not obtained prior to filing of  manufacturer's excise tax return. If the sale is otherwise exempt but  the exemption certificate is not obtained prior to the time the  manufacturer files a return covering taxes due for the period during  which the sale was made, the manufacturer must include the tax on the  sale in its return for that period. However, if the certificate is later  obtained, a claim for refund of the tax paid on the sale may be filed,  or a credit for the amount may be taken upon a subsequent return, as  provided by section 6416(b)(2) and Sec. 48.6416(b)-2.  (Secs. 4071(b), 4071(c), 4073(c), and 7805, Internal Revenue Code of  1954.
