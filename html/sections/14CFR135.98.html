                            <p class="depth0">After August 13, 2008, no certificate holder may operate an aircraft in the region north of 78[deg] N latitude (``North Polar Area''), other than intrastate operations wholly within the state of Alaska, unless authorized by the FAA. The certificate holder's operation specifications must include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The designation of airports that may be used for en-route diversions and the requirements the airports must meet at the time of diversion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for all-cargo operations, a recovery plan for passengers at designated diversion airports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A fuel-freeze strategy and procedures for monitoring fuel freezing for operations in the North Polar Area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A plan to ensure communication capability for operations in the North Polar Area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An MEL for operations in the North Polar Area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A training plan for operations in the North Polar Area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A plan for mitigating crew exposure to radiation during solar flare activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A plan for providing at least two cold weather anti-exposure suits in the aircraft, to protect crewmembers during outside activity at a diversion airport with extreme climatic conditions. The FAA may relieve the certificate holder from this requirement if the season of the year makes the equipment unnecessary.
