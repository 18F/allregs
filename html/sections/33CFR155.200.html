An on-deck spill could result from a leaking fitting, an overfill, a bad connection, or similar operational mishap. The term on-deck spill is used to differentiate these operational discharges from those caused by collision or grounding where the hull is punctured and a tank is ruptured, resulting in an uncontrolled discharge of oil into the marine environment.</p><p class="depth0">Offshore oil barge means a tank barge carrying oil in bulk as cargo, including dual-mode integrated tug-barges, certificated by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter D, for navigation in waters outside the Boundary Lines, as defined in 46 CFR part 7, in any ocean or the Gulf of Mexico; any tank barge in Great Lakes service; or any foreign flag tank barge.</p><p class="depth0">Oil tanker means a self-propelled vessel carrying oil in bulk as cargo, including integrated tug-barges designed for push-mode operation.</p><p class="depth0">Vessel carrying oil as secondary cargo means a vessel carrying oil pursuant to a permit issued under 46 CFR 30.01-5, 46 CFR 70.05-30, or 46 CFR 90.05-35 or pursuant to an International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) or Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) certificate required by Sec. 151.33 or Sec. 151.35 of this chapter; or any uninspected vessel that carries oil in bulk as cargo.
