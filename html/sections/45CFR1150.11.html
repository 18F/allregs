                            <p class="depth0">A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or  contract will be considered as a single claim in determining whether the  claim is one of not more than $100,000, excluding interest, for the  purpose of compromise or suspension or termination of collection action.  Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling  established by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended.  Joining two or more claims in a demand upon a debtor for payment of more  than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or suspension or termination  of collection action with regard to any one claim not exceeding  $100,000, excluding interest.</p>
