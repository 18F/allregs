                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)  of this section, an owner may make an election under section 181 to  deduct production costs of a production only if that owner has not  deducted in a previous taxable year any production costs for that  production under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) other  than section 181.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. An owner may make an election under section 181  despite prior deductions under any other provision of the Code for  amortization of the costs of acquiring or developing screenplays,  scripts, story outlines, motion picture production rights to books and  plays, and other similar properties for purposes of potential future  development or production of a production, if such costs were paid or  incurred before the first taxable year for which an election may be made  under Sec. 1.181-2(b) and are included in aggregate production costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time of making election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The election to deduct  production costs for a production under section 181   must be made by the due date (including any extension) for filing the  owner's Federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any aggregate production costs have been paid or incurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and  circumstances) that the production will be set for production and will,  upon completion, be a qualified film or television production; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For any pre-amendment production, the owner reasonably expects  (based on all of the facts and circumstances) that the aggregate  production costs paid or incurred for the pre-amendment production will,  at no time, exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit set  forth under Sec. 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em> that are deductible  under Sec. 1.181-1(a)(1)(i) for the taxable year paragraph (b)(1) of  this section is first satisfied and the election is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Six-month extension. See Sec. 301.9100-2 for a six-month  extension of time to make the election in certain circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner of making election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An owner must make  the election under section 181 separately for each production. For a  production owned by an entity, the election must be made by the entity.  For example, if the production is owned by a partnership or S  corporation, the partnership or S corporation must make the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information required--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initial election. For each production  to which the election applies, the owner must attach a statement to the  owner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the election  stating that the owner is making an election under section 181 and  providing--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name (or other unique identifying designation) of the  production;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date aggregate production costs were first paid or incurred  for the production;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The amount of aggregate production costs paid or incurred for  the production during the taxable year (including costs described in  Sec. Sec. 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181-2(b)(2));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The amount of qualified compensation (as defined in Sec. 1.181- 3(d)) paid or incurred for the production during the taxable year  (including costs described in Sec. 1.181-2(b)(2));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The amount of compensation (as defined in Sec. 1.181-3(c)) paid  or incurred for the production during the taxable year (including costs  described in Sec. 1.181-2(b)(2));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> If the owner expects that the aggregate production costs of the  production will be significantly paid or incurred in (or, if applicable,  if a significant portion of the total number of days of first-unit  principal photography will occur in) one or more of the areas specified  in Sec. 1.181-1(b)(2)(i), the identity of the area or areas, the amount  of aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of  first-unit principal photography engaged in) for the applicable  activities described in Sec. 1.181-1(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or  (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, that took place within such areas (including  costs described in Sec. Sec. 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181-2(b)(2)), and  the aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the total number of  days of first-unit principal photography engaged in) for such activities  (whether or not they took place in such areas), for the taxable year  (including costs described in Sec. Sec. 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181- 2(b)(2));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A declaration that the owner reasonably expects (based on all of  the facts and circumstances at the time the election is made) both that  the production will be set for production (or has been set for  production) and will be a qualified film or television production; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> For any pre-amendment production, a declaration that the owner  reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the  time   the election is made) that the aggregate production costs paid or  incurred for the pre-amendment production will not, at any time, exceed  the applicable aggregate production costs limit set forth under Sec.  1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent taxable years. If the owner pays or incurs  additional production costs in any taxable year subsequent to the  taxable year for which production costs are first deducted under section  181, the owner must attach a statement to its Federal income tax return  for that subsequent taxable year providing--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name (or other unique identifying designation) of the  production that was used in the initial election, and any revised name  (or unique identifying designation) subsequently used for the  production;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date the aggregate production costs were first paid or  incurred for the production;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The amount of aggregate production costs paid or incurred for  the production during the current taxable year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The amount of qualified compensation paid or incurred for the  production during the current taxable year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The amount of compensation paid or incurred for the production  during the current taxable year, and the aggregate amount of  compensation paid or incurred for the production in all prior taxable  years;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> If the owner expects that the aggregate production costs of the  production will be significantly paid or incurred in (or, if applicable,  if a significant portion of the total number of days of first-unit  principal photography will occur in) one or more of the areas specified  in Sec. 1.181-1(b)(2)(i), the identity of the area or areas, the amount  of aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of  first-unit principal photography engaged in) for the applicable  activities described in Sec. 1.181-1(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or  (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, that took place within such areas, and the  aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of  first-unit principal photography engaged in) for such activities  (whether or not they took place in such areas), for the current taxable  year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A declaration that the owner continues to reasonably expect  (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the current  taxable year) both that the production will be set for production (or  has been set for production) and will be a qualified film or television  production; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> For any pre-amendment production, a declaration that the owner  continues to reasonably expect (based on all of the facts and  circumstances at the end of the current taxable year) that the aggregate  production costs paid or incurred for the pre-amendment production will  not, at any time, exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit  set forth under Sec. 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deductions by more than one person. If more than one person will  claim deductions under section 181 with respect to the production for  the taxable year, each person claiming the deduction (but not the  members of an entity who are issued a Schedule K-1 by the entity with  respect to their interest in the production) must provide a list of the  names and taxpayer identification numbers of all such persons, the  dollar amount that each such person will deduct under section 181, and  the information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section for all  such persons. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, whether or not  multiple persons form a partnership with respect to the production will  be determined in accordance with Sec. 301.7701-3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revocation of election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An owner may revoke an  election made under this section only with the consent of the  Commissioner. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an  owner seeking consent to revoke an election made under this section must  submit a letter ruling request, other than a Form 3115, ``Application  for Change in Accounting Method,'' under the appropriate revenue  procedure. See, for example, Rev. Proc. 2011-1, 2011-1 CB 1 (updated  annually) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consent granted. The Commissioner grants consent to an owner to  revoke an election under this section   for a particular production if the owner--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Complies with the recapture provisions of Sec. 1.181-4(a)(3) on  a timely filed (including any extension) original Federal income tax  return for the taxable year of the revocation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Attaches a statement to that Federal income tax return that  includes the name of the production that was in the owner's original  election statement, and any revised name (or other unique identifying  designation) of the production, and a statement that the owner revokes  the election under section 181 for that production, pursuant to Sec.  1.181-2(d)(2).
