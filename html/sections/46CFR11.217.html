                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this  subchapter must be paid before the applicant may take the first  examination section. If an applicant fails three or more sections of the  examination, a complete re-examination must be taken. On the subsequent  exam, if the applicant again fails three or more sections, at least 3  months must elapse before another complete examination is attempted, and  a new examination fee is required. If an applicant fails one or   two sections of an examination, the applicant may be retested twice on  these sections during the next 3 months. If the applicant does not  successfully complete these sections within the 3-month period, a  complete re-examination must be taken at least 3 months from the date of  the last retest, and a new examination fee is required. The 3-month  retest period may be extended by the Coast Guard if the applicant  presents evidence documenting sea time that prevented the taking of a  retest during the 3-month period. The retest period may not be extended  beyond 7 months from the initial examination. All examinations and  retests must be completed within 1 year of approval for examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Coast Guard refuses to grant an applicant the endorsement  applied for due to the applicant's failure to pass a required  examination, the Coast Guard will provide the applicant with a written  statement setting forth the portions of the examination that must be  retaken and the date by which the examination must be completed.
