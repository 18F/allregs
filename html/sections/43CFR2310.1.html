                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The basic steps leading up to the making, modification or extension of a withdrawal, except emergency withdrawals, are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preapplication consultation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Obtaining Secretarial approval of a withdrawal petition in appropriate cases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submission for filing of an application for a requested withdrawal action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Publication in the Federal Register of a notice stating that a withdrawal proposal has been made or that an application has been submitted for filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Negotiations between the applicant and the authorized officer as well as the accomplishment of investigations, studies and analyses which may be required to process an application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Preparation of the case file to be considered by the Secretary, including the authorized officer's findings and recommendations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transmittal of the case file to the Director, Bureau of Land Management, for the Director's review and decision regarding the findings and recommendations of the authorized officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Transmittal of the case file to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Publication of a public land order or a notice of denial signed by the Secretary. If the application seeks a national defense withdrawal that may only be made by an Act of Congress, the Secretary will transmit to the Congress proposed legislation along with the Secretary's recommendations, and documentation relating thereto.


Sec. 2310.1-1  Preapplication consultation.</p><p class="depth0">A potential applicant should contact the appropriate State office of the Bureau of Land Management well in advance of the anticipated submission date of an application. Early consultation can familiarize the potential applicant with the responsibilities of an applicant, the authorized officer and the Secretary. Early consultation also will assist in determining the need for a withdrawal, taking possible alternatives into account, increase the likelihood that the applicant's needs will be considered in ongoing land use planning, assist in determining the extent to which any public lands that may be involved would have to be segregated if an application is submitted; and result in preliminary determinations regarding the scheduling of various investigations, studies, analyses, public meetings and negotiations that may be required for a withdrawal. Studies and analyses should be programmed to ensure their completion in sufficient time to allow the Secretary or the Congress adequate time to act on the application before the expiration of the segregation period.


Sec. 2310.1-2  Submission of applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applications for the making, modification or extension of a withdrawal shall be submitted for filing, in duplicate, in the proper Bureau of Land Management office, as set forth in

Sec. 1821.2-1 of this title, except for emergency withdrawal requests and applications that are classified for national security reasons. Requests for emergency withdrawals and applications that are classified for national security reasons shall be submitted, in duplicate, in the Office of the Secretary, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Before the authorized officer can take action on a withdrawal proposal, a withdrawal application in support thereof shall be submitted. The application may be submitted simultaneously with the making of a withdrawal proposal, in which case only the notice required by Sec. 2310.3-1(a) of this title, referencing both the application and the withdrawal proposal, shall be published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No specific form is required, but, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 2310.3-6(b) of this title, the application shall contain at least the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the applicant. Where the organization intending to use the lands is different from the applicant, the name and address of such using agency shall also be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant is a department or agency other than the Department of the Interior or an office thereof, a statement of the delegation or delegations of authority of the official acting on behalf of the department or agency submitting the application, substantiating that the official is empowered to act on behalf of the head of the department or agency in connection with all matters pertaining to the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the lands which are subject to an application are wholly or partially under the administration of any department or agency other than the Department of the Interior, the Secretary shall make or modify a withdrawal only with the consent of the head of the department or agency concerned, except in the case of an emergency withdrawal. In such case, a copy of the written consent shall accompany the application. The requirements of section (e) of E.O. 10355 (17 FR 4831), shall be complied with in those instances where the Order applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The type of withdrawal action that is being requested (See Sec. 2300.0-5(h) of this title) and whether the application pertains to the making, extension or modification of a withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A description of the lands involved in the application, which shall consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A legal description of the entire land area that falls within the exterior boundaries of the affected area and the total acreage of such lands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A legal description of the lands, Federal or otherwise, within the exterior boundaries that are to be excepted from the requested action, and after deducting the total acreage of all the excepted lands, the net remaining acreage of all Federal lands (as well as all non-Federal lands which, if they should be returned to or should pass to Federal ownership, would become subject to the withdrawal) within the exterior boundaries of the affected land areas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a national defense withdrawal which can only be made by an Act of Congress, sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Act of February 28, 1958 (43 U.S.C. 157 (2), (3)) shall be complied with in lieu of paragraphs (c)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the application is for a withdrawal that would overlap, or that would add lands to one or more existing withdrawals, the application shall also contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An identification of each of the existing withdrawals, including the project name, if any, the date of the withdrawal order, the number and type of order, if known, or, in lieu of the foregoing, a copy of the order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As to each existing withdrawal that would be overlapped by the requested withdrawal, the total area and a legal description of the area that would be overlapped; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The total acreage, Federal or otherwise, that would be added to the existing withdrawal, if the new application is allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The public purpose or statutory program for which the lands would be withdrawn. If the purpose or program for which the lands would be withdrawn is classified for national security reasons, a statement to that effect shall be included; but, if at all possible, a general description of the use to

which the lands would be devoted, if the requested withdrawal is allowed, should be included. In the case of applications that are not classified for national security reasons, an analysis of the manner in which the lands as well as their natural resources and resource values would be used to implement the purpose or program shall be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The extent to which the lands embraced in the application are requested to be withheld from settlement, sale, location or entry under the public land laws, including the mining laws, together with the extent to which, and the time during which, the lands involved in the application would be temporarily segregated in accordance with Sec. 2310.2 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The type of temporary land use that, at the discretion of the authorized officer, may be permitted or allowed during the segregation period, in accordance with Sec. 2310.2 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> An analysis and explanation of why neither a right-of-way under section 507 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1767), nor a cooperative agreement under sections 302(b) (43 U.S.C. 1732(b)) and 307(b) (43 U.S.C. 1737(b)) of the act would adequately provide for the proposed use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The duration of the withdrawal, with a statement in justification thereof (see Sec. 2310.3-4 of this title). Where an extension of an existing withdrawal is requested, its duration may not exceed the duration of the existing withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> A statement as to whether any suitable alternative sites are available for the proposed use or for uses which the requested withdrawal action would displace. The statement shall include a study comparing the projected costs of obtaining each alternative site in suitable condition for the intended use, as well as the projected costs of obtaining and developing each alternative site for uses that the requested withdrawal action would displace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> A statement as to whether water will or will not be needed to fulfill the purpose of the requested withdrawal action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> The place where records relating to the application can be examined by interested persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except in the case of an emergency withdrawal, if the preceding application requirements have not been met, or if an application seeks an action that is not within the scope of the Secretary's authority, the application may be rejected by the authorized officer as a defective application.


Sec. 2310.1-3  Submission of withdrawal petitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Withdrawal petitions shall be submitted to the Director, Bureau of Land Management, for transmittal to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No specific form is required, but the petition shall contain at least the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The office originating the petition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The type and purpose of the proposed withdrawal action (See Sec. 2300.0-5(h) of this title) and whether the petition pertains to the making, extension or modification of a withdrawal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A legal description of the entire land area that falls within the exterior boundaries affected by the petition, together with the total acreage of such lands, and a map of the area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which and the time during which any public lands that may be involved in the petition would be temporarily segregated and the temporary land uses that may be permitted during the segregation period, in accordance with Sec. 2310.2 of this title; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A preliminary identification of the mineral resources in the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except in the case of petitions seeking emergency withdrawals, if a petition is submitted simultaneously with a withdrawal application, the information requirements pertaining to withdrawal applications (See Sec. 2310.1-2 of this title), shall supersede the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If a petition seeks an emergency withdrawal under the provisions of section 204(e) of the act, the petition shall be filed simultaneously with an application for withdrawal. In such instances, the petition/application shall provide as much of the information required by Sec. Sec. 2310.1-2(c) and 2310.3-2(b) of this title as is available to the petitioner when the petition is submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Upon the approval by the Secretary of a petition for withdrawal, the

petition shall be considered as a Secretarial proposal for withdrawal, and notice of the withdrawal proposal shall be published immediately in the Federal Register in accordance with Sec. 2310.3-1(a) of this title. If a petition which seeks an emergency withdrawal is approved by the Secretary, the publication and notice provisions pertaining to emergency withdrawals shall be applicable. (See Sec. 2310.5 of this title.)


Sec. 2310.1-4  Cancellation of withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals and denial of applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Withdrawal or extension applications and proposals shall be amended promptly to cancel the application or proposal, in whole or in part, with respect to any lands which the applicant, in the case of applications, or the office, in the case of proposals, determines are no longer needed in connection with a requested or proposed action. The filing of a cancellation notice in each such case shall result in the termination of the segregation of the public lands that are to be eliminated from the withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal. (See Sec. 2310.2-1 of this title)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may deny an application if the costs (as defined in section 304(b) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1734(b)) estimated to be incurred by the Department of the Interior would, in the judgment of the Secretary, be excessive in relation to available funds appropriated for processing applications requesting a discretionary withdrawal, or a modification or extension of a withdrawal.</p>
