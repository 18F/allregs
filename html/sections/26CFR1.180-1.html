                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may  elect, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, to treat  as deductible expenses those expenditures otherwise chargeable to  capital account which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable  year for the purchase or acquisition of fertilizer, lime, ground  limestone, marl, or other materials to enrich, neutralize, or condition  land used in farming, and those expenditures otherwise chargeable to  capital account paid or incurred for the application of such items and  materials to such land. No election is required to be made for those  expenditures which are not capital in nature. Section 180, Sec. 1.180- 2, and this section are not applicable to those expenses which are  deductible under section 162 and the regulations thereunder or which are  subject to the method described in section 175 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. Expenditures for the  initial preparation of land never previously used for farming purposes  by the taxpayer or his tenant (although chargeable to capital account)  are not subject to the election. The principles stated in Sec. Sec.  1.175-3 and 1.175-4 are equally applicable under this section in  determining whether the taxpayer is engaged in the business of farming  and whether the land is used in farming.
