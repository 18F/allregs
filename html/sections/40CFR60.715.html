                            <p class="depth0">Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under Sec.  60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If  it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant  coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results,  formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between  a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test  will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample  taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the  sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base film  (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added  during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed  immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added  after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the  calculations that use Method 24 results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and (2) of  this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each  lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the method is to be used in the determination of the  efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust  stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to Sec.  60.713(b)(2), (4), (5), or (6), the test shall consist of three separate  runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the  adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the method is to be used in the determination of the  efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual  exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.713(b)(3),  (4), (5), or (6), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The  test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each  run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow  rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Method 3 is used for gas analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as  applicable, at least twice during each test period.
