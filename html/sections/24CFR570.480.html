                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes policies and procedures applicable to  states that have permanently elected to receive Community Development  Block Grant (CDBG) funds for distribution to units of general local  government in the state's nonentitlement areas under the Housing and  Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (the Act). Other subparts  of part 570 are not applicable to the State CDBG program, except as  expressly provided otherwise. Regulations of part 570 outside of this  subpart that apply to the State CDBG program include Sec. Sec.   570.200(j) and 570.606.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> HUD's authority for the waiver of regulations and for the  suspension of requirements to address damage in a Presidentially- declared disaster area is described in 24 CFR part 5 and in section 122  of the Act, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In exercising the Secretary's obligation and responsibility to  review a state's performance, the Secretary will give maximum feasible  deference to the state's interpretation of the statutory requirements  and the requirements of this regulation, provided that these  interpretations are not plainly inconsistent with the Act and the  Secretary's obligation to enforce compliance with the intent of the  Congress as declared in the Act. The Secretary will not determine that a  state has failed to carry out its certifications in compliance with  requirements of the Act (and this regulation) unless the Secretary finds  that procedures and requirements adopted by the state are insufficient  to afford reasonable assurance that activities undertaken by units of  general local government were not plainly inappropriate to meeting the  primary objectives of the Act, this regulation, and the state's  community development objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative action taken by the Secretary that is not  explicitly and fully part of this regulation shall only apply to a  specific case or issue at a specific time, and shall not be generally  applicable to the state-administered CDBG program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Religious organizations are eligible to participate under the  State CDBG Program as provided in Sec.  570.200(j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In administering the CDBG program, a state may impose additional  or more restrictive provisions on units of general local government  participating in the state's program, provided that such provisions are  not inconsistent with the Act or other statutory or regulatory  provisions that are applicable to the State CDBG program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> States shall make CDBG program grants only to units of general  local government. This restriction does not limit a state's authority to  make payments to other parties for state administrative expenses and  technical assistance activities authorized in section 106(d) of the Act.
