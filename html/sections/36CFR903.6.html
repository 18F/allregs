If the reviewing official denies the appeal, he or she shall advise the individual in writing of the decision and the reasons for reaching it, and that the denial of the appeal is a final agency action entitling the individual to seek judicial review in the appropriate district court of the United States as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).
