                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall develop and  implement a plan and schedule to modify the ambient air quality  monitoring network that complies with the findings of the network  assessments required every 5 years by Sec. 58.10(e). The State or local  agency shall consult with the EPA Regional Administrator during the  development of the schedule to modify the monitoring program, and shall  make the plan and schedule available to the public for 30 days prior to   submission to the EPA Regional Administrator. The final plan and  schedule with respect to the SLAMS network are subject to the approval  of the EPA Regional Administrator. Plans containing modifications to  NCore Stations or PAMS Stations shall be submitted to the Administrator.  The Regional Administrator shall provide opportunity for public comment  and shall approve or disapprove submitted plans and schedules within 120  days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this section shall preclude the State, or where  appropriate local, agency from making modifications to the SLAMS network  for reasons other than those resulting from the periodic network  assessments. These modifications must be reviewed and approved by the  Regional Administrator. Each monitoring network may make or be required  to make changes between the 5-year assessment periods, including for  example, site relocations or the addition of PAMS networks in bumped-up  ozone nonattainment areas. These modifications must address changes  invoked by a new census and changes due to changing air quality levels.  The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall provide written  communication describing the network changes to the Regional  Administrator for review and approval as these changes are identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State, or where appropriate, local agency requests for SLAMS  monitor station discontinuation, subject to the review of the Regional  Administrator, will be approved if any of the following criteria are met  and if the requirements of appendix D to this part, if any, continue to  be met. Other requests for discontinuation may also be approved on a  case-by-case basis if discontinuance does not compromise data collection  needed for implementation of a NAAQS and if the requirements of appendix  D to this part, if any, continue to be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any PM 2.5, O3, CO, PM 10,  SO2, Pb, or NO2 SLAMS monitor which has shown  attainment during the previous five years, that has a probability of  less than 10 percent of exceeding 80 percent of the applicable NAAQS  during the next three years based on the levels, trends, and variability  observed in the past, and which is not specifically required by an  attainment plan or maintenance plan. In a nonattainment or maintenance  area, if the most recent attainment or maintenance plan adopted by the  State and approved by EPA contains a contingency measure to be triggered  by an air quality concentration and the monitor to be discontinued is  the only SLAMS monitor operating in the nonattainment or maintenance  area, the monitor may not be discontinued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any SLAMS monitor for CO, PM 10, SO2, or  NO2 which has consistently measured lower concentrations than  another monitor for the same pollutant in the same county (or portion of  a county within a distinct attainment area, nonattainment area, or  maintenance area, as applicable) during the previous five years, and  which is not specifically required by an attainment plan or maintenance  plan, if control measures scheduled to be implemented or discontinued  during the next five years would apply to the areas around both monitors  and have similar effects on measured concentrations, such that the  retained monitor would remain the higher reading of the two monitors  being compared.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any pollutant, any SLAMS monitor in a county (or portion of  a county within a distinct attainment, nonattainment, or maintenance  area, as applicable) provided the monitor has not measured violations of  the applicable NAAQS in the previous five years, and the approved SIP  provides for a specific, reproducible approach to representing the air  quality of the affected county in the absence of actual monitoring data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A PM 2.5 SLAMS monitor which EPA has determined  cannot be compared to the relevant NAAQS because of the siting of the  monitor, in accordance with Sec. 58.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A SLAMS monitor that is designed to measure concentrations  upwind of an urban area for purposes of characterizing transport into  the area and that has not recorded violations of the relevant NAAQS in  the previous five years, if discontinuation of the monitor is tied to  start-up of another station also characterizing transport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A SLAMS monitor not eligible for removal under any of the  criteria in   paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section may be moved to a  nearby location with the same scale of representation if logistical  problems beyond the State's control make it impossible to continue  operation at its current site.</p>
