Sec. 2812.4-1  Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting compensation payable by licensee to permittee for use of road.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the event the United States exercises the rights received from a permittee hereunder to license a person to remove forest products over any road, right-of-way, or lands of the permittee or of his successor in interest, to the extent that such matters are not covered by an agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 of this subpart, such licensee will be required to pay the permittee or his successor in interest such compensation and to furnish him such security, and to carry such liability insurance as the permittee or his successor in interest and the licensee may agree upon. If the parties do not agree, then upon the written request of either party delivered to the other party, the matter shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the procedures established by Sec. 2812.4-4. During the pendency of such arbitration proceedings the licensee shall be entitled to use the road, right-of-way, or lands involved upon payment, or tender thereof validly maintained, to the permittee of an amount to be determined by the authorized officer and upon the furnishing to the permittee of a corporate surety bond in an amount equal to the difference between the amount fixed by the authorized officer and the amount sought by the permittee. The licensee shall also, as a condition of use in such circumstances, maintain such liability insurance in such amounts covering any additional hazard and risk which might accrue by reason of the licensee's use of the road, as the authorized officer may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The arbitrators shall base their award as to the compensation to be paid by the licensee to the permittee or his successor in interest upon the amortization of the replacement costs for

a road of the type involved, including in such replacement costs an extraordinary cost peculiar to the construction of the particular road involved and subtracting therefrom any capital investment made by the United States or its licensees in the particular road involved or in improvements thereto used by and useful to the permittee or his successor in interest plus a reasonable interest allowance on the resulting cost figure, taking into account the risk involved, plus costs of maintenance if furnished by the permittee or his successor, including costs of gates and gateman. In arriving at the amortization item, the arbitrators shall take into account the probable period of time, past and present, during which such road may be in existence, and the volume of timber which has been moved and the volume of timber currently merchantable, which probably will be moved from all sources over such road. The arbitrators shall also take into account the extent to which the use which the licensee might otherwise economically make of the road system is limited by Sec. 2812.3-5. In addition, the arbitrators may fix the rate at which payments shall be made by the licensee during his use of the road. The arbitrators shall require the licensee to provide adequate bond, cash deposit, or other security to indemnify the permittee or his successor in interest against failure of the licensee to comply with the terms of the award and against damage to the road not incident to normal usage and for any other reasonable purpose, and also to carry appropriate liability insurance covering any additional hazard and risks which may accrue by reason of the licensee's use of the road.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where improvements or additions are required to enable a licensee to use a road or right-of-way to remove timber or forest products, the cost of such improvements will be allowable to the licensee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The full value at current stumpage prices will be allocable against a licensee for all timber to be cut, removed, or destroyed by the licensee on a permittee's land in the construction or improvement of the road involved.


Sec. 2812.4-2  Compensation payable by United States to permittee for use of road.</p><p class="depth0">In the event the United States itself removes forest products over any road or right-of-way of the permittee or his successor in interest, the United States, if there has been no agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 covering the matter, shall pay to the permittee or his successor in interest reasonable compensation as determined by the State Director, who shall base his determination upon the same standards established by this paragraph for arbitrators in the determination of the compensation to be paid by a licensee to a permittee: Provided, however, That no bond or other security or liability insurance is to be required of the United States. When the United States constructs or improves a road on a permittee's land or right-of-way it shall pay to the permittee the full value at current stumpage prices of all timber of the permittee cut, removed, or destroyed in the construction or maintenance of such road or road improvements. Current stumpage prices shall be determined by the application of the standard appraisal formula, used in appraising O. and C. timber for sale, to the volume and grade of timber. Such volume and grade shall be determined by a cruise made by the permittee or, at his request, by the authorized officer. If either the permittee or the authorized officer does not accept the cruise made by the other, the volume and grade shall be determined by a person or persons acceptable both to the permittee and the State Director.


Sec. 2812.4-3  Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting adjustment of road use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When the United States exercises the right received under this paragraph to use or to license any person to use a road of a permittee, the permittee or his successor in interest shall not unreasonably obstruct the United States or such licensee in such use. If there has been no agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 covering such matters, the permittee shall have the right to prescribe reasonable operating regulations, to apply uniformly as between the permittee and such licensee, covering the use of

such road for such matters as speed and load limits, scheduling of hauls during period of use by more than one timber operator, coordination of peak periods of use, and such other matters as are reasonably related to safe operations and protection of the road; if the capacity of such road should be inadequate to accommodate the use thereof which such licensee and permittee desire to make concurrently, they shall endeavor to adjust their respective uses by agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the permittee and such licensee are unable to agree as to the reasonableness of such operating regulations or on the adjustment of their respective uses where the capacity of the road is inadequate to accommodate their concurrent use, then upon the written request of either party delivered to the other party, the matter shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the procedures established by Sec. 2812.4-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The arbitrators may make such disposition of a dispute involving the reasonableness of such operating regulations as appears equitable to them, taking into account the capacity and the construction of the road and the volume of use to which it will be subjected. In the determination of a dispute arising out of the inadequacy of the capacity of a road to accommodate the concurrent use by a permittee and a licensee, the arbitrators may make such disposition thereof as appears equitable to them, taking into account, among other pertinent facts, the commitments of the permittee and the licensee with respect to the cutting and removal of the timber involved and the disposition of the products derived therefrom; the extent to which each of the parties may practicably satisfy any of the aforesaid commitments from other timber currently controlled by him; the past normal use of such road by the permittee; the extent to which federal timber has contributed to the amortization of the capital costs of such road; and the extent to which the United States or its licensees have enlarged the road capacity.


Sec. 2812.4-4  Arbitration procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within 10 days after the delivery of a written request for arbitration under Sec. 2812.4-1 or Sec. 2812.4-3 of this subpart each of the parties to the disagreement shall appoint an arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall select a third arbitrator. If either party fails to appoint an arbitrator as provided herein, the other party may apply to a court of record of the State of Oregon for the appointment of such an arbitrator, as provided by the laws of such State. If within ten days of the appointment of the second of them, the original two arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator who will accept the appointment, either party may petition such a court of record of the State of Oregon for the appointment of a third arbitrator. Should any vacancy occur by reason of the resignation, death or inability of one or more of the arbitrators to serve, the vacancy shall be filled according to the procedures applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator whose death, disability, or other inability to serve, created the vacancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By mutual agreement, the parties may submit to a single arbitration proceeding controversies arising under both Sec. Sec. 2812.4-1 and 2812.4-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The arbitrators shall hear and determine the controversy and make, file, and serve their award in accordance with the substantive standards prescribed in Sec. Sec. 2812.4-1 and 2812.4-3, for the type of controversy involved and in accordance with the procedures established by the laws of the State of Oregon pertaining to arbitration proceedings. A copy of the award shall also be served at the same time upon the authorized officer or the State Director, either personally or by registered mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be assessed by the arbitrators against either or both of the parties, as may appear equitable to the arbitrators, taking into account the original contentions of the parties, the ultimate decision of the arbitrators and such other matter as may appear relevant to the arbitrators.
