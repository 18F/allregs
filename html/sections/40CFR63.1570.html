During the period between the  compliance date specified for your affected source and the date upon  which continuous monitoring systems have been installed and validated  and any applicable operating limits have been set, you must maintain a  log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions  control equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction  plan (SSMP) according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must report each instance in which you did not meet each  emission limitation and each operating limit in this subpart that  applies to you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction. You also must report each instance in which you did not  meet the work practice standards in this subpart that apply to you.  These instances are deviations from the emission limitations and work  practice standards in this subpart. These deviations must be reported  according to the requirements in Sec. 63.1575.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations  that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not  violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that  you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1). The SSMP must  include elements designed to minimize the frequency of such periods  (i.e., root cause analysis). The Administrator will determine whether  deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or  malfunction are   violations, according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).
