                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the beginning of a growing season, as appropriate, but at least once annually, you must inspect all of your agricultural water systems, to the extent they are under your control (including water sources, water distribution systems, facilities, and equipment), to identify conditions that are reasonably likely to introduce known or reasonably foreseeable hazards into or onto covered produce or food contact surfaces in light of your covered produce, practices, and conditions, including consideration of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of each agricultural water source (for example, ground water or surface water);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent of your control over each agricultural water source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The degree of protection of each agricultural water source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of adjacent and nearby land; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The likelihood of introduction of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to agricultural water by another user of agricultural water before the water reaches your covered farm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must adequately maintain all agricultural water distribution systems to the extent they are under your control as necessary and appropriate to prevent the water distribution system from being a source of contamination to covered produce, food contact surfaces, areas used for a covered activity,

or water sources, including by regularly inspecting and adequately storing all equipment used in the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must adequately maintain all agricultural water sources to the extent they are under your control (such as wells). Such maintenance includes regularly inspecting each source to identify any conditions that are reasonably likely to introduce known or reasonably foreseeable hazards into or onto covered produce or food contact surfaces; correcting any significant deficiencies (e.g., repairs to well cap, well casing, sanitary seals, piping tanks and treatment equipment, and control of cross-connections); and keeping the source free of debris, trash, domesticated animals, and other possible sources of contamination of covered produce to the extent practicable and appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As necessary and appropriate, you must implement measures reasonably necessary to reduce the potential for contamination of covered produce with known or reasonably foreseeable hazards as a result of contact of covered produce with pooled water. For example, such measures may include using protective barriers or staking to keep covered produce from touching the ground or using an alternative irrigation method.</p>
