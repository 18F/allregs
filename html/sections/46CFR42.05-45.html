                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term international voyage as used in this part shall have  the same meaning as the term international voyage in Article 2(4) of the  1966 Convention. Except for vessels operating solely on the waters  indicated in Article 5(2) of the 1966 Convention, an international  voyage means a sea voyage from any country to a port outside such  country, or conversely. For this purpose, every territory for the  international relations of which any specific Contracting Government is  responsible or for which the United Nations are the administering  authority is regarded as a separate country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The 1966 Convention does not apply to vessels solely navigating  the Great Lakes. Accordingly, such vessels shall not be considered as  being on an international voyage for the purpose of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of administration of load line requirements in  this subchapter, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Territory of Guam,  the Virgin Islands, and all possessions and lands held by the United  States under a protectorate or mandate shall each be considered to be a  territory of the United States.
