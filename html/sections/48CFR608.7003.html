No GSA waiver is required for official vehicles purchased outside the United States from non-U.S. sources. Normal acquisition procedures shall be followed. However, contracting officers should be aware that statutory ceilings apply to the acquisition of passenger vehicles (i.e., sedans and station wagons) (see P.L. 103-329), so other agencies shall not request that posts acquire vehicles without providing an analysis of how the price compares with this ceiling.</p>
