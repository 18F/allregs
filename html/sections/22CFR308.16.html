                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the event an individual desires to request an amendment of  his or her record, he or she may do so by submitting such written  request to the Director, Administrative Services, Peace Corps, 806  Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20526. The Director,  Administrative Services, shall provide assistance in preparing any  amendment upon request and a written acknowledgment of receipt of such  request within 10 working days after the receipt thereof from the  individual who requested the amendment. Such acknowledgment may, if  necessary, request any additional information needed to make a  determination with respect to such request. If the agency decides to  comply with the request within the 10 day period, no written  acknowledgment is necessary: Provided, however, That a certification of  the change shall be provided to such individual within such period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Promptly after acknowledgment of the receipt of a request for an  amendment the agency shall take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make any corrections of any portion of the record which the  individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform the individual of its refusal to amend the record in  accord with the request together with the reason for such refusal and  the procedures established for requesting review of such refusal by the  head of the agency or his or her designee. Such notice shall include the  name and business address of the reviewing official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refer the request to the agency that has control of and  maintains the record in those instances where the record requested  remains the property of the controlling agency and not of the Peace  Corps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In reviewing a request to amend the record the agency shall  assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the  record with due and appropriate regard for fairness to the individual  about whom the record is maintained. In making such determination, the  agency shall consult criteria for determining record quality published  in pertinent chapters of the Federal Personnel Manual and to the extent  possible shall accord therewith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event the agency agrees with the individual's request to  amend such record it shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise the individual in writing,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Correct the record accordingly, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advise all previous recipients of a record which was corrected  of the correction and its substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event the agency, after an initial review of the request  to amend a record, disagrees with all or a portion of it, the agency  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise the individual of its refusal and the reasons therefore,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform the individual that he or she may request further review  in accord with the provisions of these regulations, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify The name and address of the person to whom the request  should be directed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event an individual requester disagrees with the initial  agency determination, he or she may appeal such determination to the  Director of the Peace Corps or his or her designee. Such request for  review must be made within 30 days after receipt by the requester of the  initial refusal to amend.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If after review the Director or designee refuses to amend the  record as requested he or she shall advise the individual requester of  such refusal and the reasons for same; of his or her right to file a  concise statement in the record of the reasons for disagreeing with the  decision of the agency; of the procedures for filing a statement of  disagreement and of the fact that such statement so filed will be made  available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed  together with a brief statement of the agency summarizing its reasons  for refusal, if the agency decides to place such brief statement in the  record. The agency shall have the authority to limit the length of any  statement to be filed, such limit to depend upon the record involved.  The agency shall also inform such individual that prior recipients of  the disputed record will be provided a copy of both statements of the  dispute to the extent that the accounting of disclosures has been  maintained and of the individual's right to seek judicial review of the  agency's refusal to amend the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If after review the official determines that the record should  be amended in accordance with the individual's request, the agency shall  proceed as provided above in the event a request is granted upon initial  demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Final agency determination of an individual's request for a  review shall be concluded with 30 working days from the date of receipt  of the review request: Provided, however, That the Director or designee  may determine that fair and equitable review cannot be made within that  time. If such circumstances occur, the individual shall be notified in  writing of the additional time required and of the approximate date on  which determination of the review is expected to be completed.</p>
