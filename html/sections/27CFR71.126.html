                            <p class="depth0">On written application by a party to a proceeding, the attendance  and testimony of any person, or the production of documentary evidence  in proceedings instituted under this part may be required by personal  subpoena (Form 5600.10) or by subpoena duces tecum (Form 5600.11).  Application should be addressed to, and subpoenas should be issued by,  the administrative law judge before whom the proceedings are pending,  but may be issued by the appropriate TTB officer or by the  Administrator, if the administrative law judge is unavailable. Both the  application and the subpoena shall set forth the title of the  proceedings, the name and address of the person whose attendance is  required, the date and place of his attendance and, if documents are to  be produced, a description thereof; and the application must have  reasonable scope and specify as exactly as possible the documents  required, if any, and show their general relevance. Subpoenas shall be  served in person. When issued on behalf of the United States, service  shall be made by an officer, employee, or agent of the Treasury  Department; when issued on behalf of a permittee or applicant, service  shall be made by any person who is not a party to the proceeding and is  not less than 18 years of age.
