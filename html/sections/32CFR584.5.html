                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) A child born out of wedlock in a foreign country of an American citizen father and an alien mother does not automatically gain U.S. citizenship. The child must first be legally acknowledged by the father. Marriage to the mother may be required in order for the child to acquire U.S. citizenship. The father also must establish that he had at least 10 years of physical presence in the United States prior to the child's birth. Five of those years must have been spent in the United States after the father's 14th birthday. United States military service counts as physical presence in the United States. (See 8 U.S.C. 1101(c)(1), 1401(g), and 1409(c).) Whether the child gains the citizenship of its mother depends entirely upon the laws of the nation in which she is a citizen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A child born out of wedlock in a foreign country of an American citizen father and an alien mother does not automatically gain U.S. citizenship.

(See 8 U.S.C. 1409(c).) The child will gain the citizenship of the father only if the laws of the nation of which the father is a citizen so provide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for claiming U.S. citizenship rights. (1) A father desiring rights of U.S. citizenship for a foreign-born child must legally acknowledge the child as his own and prepare a case file. Each case is decided on its own merits. The Department of State, if the child is in a foreign nation, or the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), if the

child is in the United States, will make the decision.

The soldier should file Form N-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship) at the nearest INS office. This form can be obtained from the INS. The appendix of AR 608-3 lists the location of INS offices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any soldier who claims to be a U.S. citizen has the burden of proving that claim to the Department of State or INS, as applicable.</p>
