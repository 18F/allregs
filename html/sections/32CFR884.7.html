The requirements of the agreement are substantially met when the state authority informs the accused's commander of the accused's prospective release for return to military authorities and when the state furnishes the accused transportation back to his or her station, together with necessary funds to cover incidental expenses en route. The accused's commander provides copies of the statement or agreement of this section and in Sec. 884.6(b) to the civilian authority to whom the member was delivered and to the Air Force unit, activity, or recruiting office nearest to the place of trial designated in the agreement as the point of contact in the event of release on bail or on recognizance (see Sec. 884.4).
