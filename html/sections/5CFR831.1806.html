                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Refunds--incomplete debt claims. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a creditor agency sends  OPM a notice of debt or an incomplete debt claim against a refund OPM is  processing for payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but  will not make any payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the  creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must  be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM  within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon  request, OPM will grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60  days if the request for extension is received before the   lump-sum payment has been made. The extension will commence on the day  after the 120-day period expires so that the total time OPM holds  payment of the refund will not exceed 180 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a  complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund  under section 8342(a) of title 5, United States Code, in one of two  ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor  of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the  amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any  amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of  the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the time limit for  submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Refunds--complete debt claims--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If OPM receives an  application from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's  debt claim. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a refund has been paid, we will notify the creditor  agency there are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of  debts due because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits  premiums while he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary  was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies  should refer to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to  recover the outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the SF 2805 on  file in the event the debtor is once again employed in a position  subject to retirement deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a refund is payable, and the creditor agency submits a  complete debt claim in accordance with Sec. 831.1805(b) (1), (2), (3),  or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid  to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim,  judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the  creditor agency was paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the  agency's debt claim is received. If a debtor has not filed application  for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM  will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided  the creditor agency initiated the administrative offset before the  statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).)  OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application  from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the  debt. (Note: If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency  must notify OPM so it can void the debt claim).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Future recovery. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If OPM receives an application for refund  within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the  creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt,  the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the  date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency  indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will  contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and  request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest.  OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year  after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest  accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt  is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the  interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must  give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed  financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4  CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as  requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's  changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to  offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency  decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested  information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's  request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the  individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annuities--incomplete debt claims. If a creditor agency sends  OPM notice   of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor who is receiving  an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will notify the  creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must  be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM. No  time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim against an  annuity; however, a complete debt claim must be received within 10 years  of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR  102.3(b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Annuities--complete debt claims--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice. When  OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM  will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a  copy of the debt claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor  agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning deductions. If OPM has already established the  debtor's annuity payment, deductions will begin with the next available  annuity payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity  payments, deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments,  but will begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month  following the last advance payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Updating accrued interest. Once OPM has completed a  collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the  creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due  within 90 days of the date of the final payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claims held for future recovery. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If OPM receives an  application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt  claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year  after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the  creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is  still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a  satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes  that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset  unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the  offset, it must submit the requested information and any new  instructions about the collection to OPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on OPM review. In no case will OPM review--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The merits of a creditor agency's decision with regard to  reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required  in any particular proceeding.</p>
