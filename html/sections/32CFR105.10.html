care and understand their available reporting options (Restricted and Unrestricted) and available SAPR services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be authorized by this part to accept reports of sexual assault along with the SAPR VA and healthcare personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Report directly to the installation commander in accordance with 32 CFR part 103, to include providing regular updates to the installation commander and assist the commander to meet annual SAPR training requirements, including providing orientation briefings for newly assigned personnel and, as appropriate, providing community education publicizing available SAPR services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide a 24 hour, 7 day per week response capability to victims of sexual assault, to include deployed areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> SARCs shall respond (see Sec. 105.3) to every Restricted and Unrestricted Report of sexual assault on a military installation and the response shall be in person, unless otherwise requested by the victim.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the locality, the SARC may ask the SAPR VA to respond and speak to the victim.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> There will be situations where a sexual assault victim receives medical care and a SAFE outside of a military installation under a MOU or MOA with local private or public sector entities. In these cases, pursuant to the MOU or MOA, victims shall be asked whether they would like the SARC to be notified, and, if so, the SARC or SAPR VA shall be notified, and a SARC or SAPR VA shall respond.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When contacted by the SARC or SAPR VA, a sexual assault victim can elect not to speak to the SARC or SAPR VA, or the sexual assault victim may ask to schedule an appointment at a later time to speak to the SARC or SAPR VA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> SARCs shall provide a response that recognizes the high prevalence of pre-existing trauma (prior to the present sexual assault incident).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> SARCs shall provide a response that is gender-responsive, culturally-competent, and recovery-oriented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> SARCs shall offer appropriate referrals to sexual assault victims and facilitate access to referrals.
