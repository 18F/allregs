                            <p class="depth0">In the case of exports involving classified technical data or  defense articles, the Defense Security Service may take appropriate  action to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense National  Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (unless such requirements  are in direct conflict with guidance provided by the Directorate of  Defense Trade Controls, in which case the latter guidance must be  followed). Upon a request to the Defense Security Service regarding the  export of any classified defense article or technical data, the Defense  Security Service official or a designated government transmittal  authority may require the production of other relevant documents and  information relating to the proposed export.
