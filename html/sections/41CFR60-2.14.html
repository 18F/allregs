                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose: Availability is an estimate of the number of qualified  minorities or women available for employment in a given job group,  expressed as a percentage of all qualified persons available for  employment in the job group. The purpose of the availability  determination is to establish a benchmark against which the demographic  composition of the contractor's incumbent workforce can be compared in  order to determine whether barriers to equal employment opportunity may  exist within particular job groups.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contractor must separately determine the availability of  minorities and women for each job group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining availability, the contractor must consider at  least the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The percentage of minorities or women with requisite skills in  the reasonable recruitment area. The reasonable recruitment area is  defined as the   geographical area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably  could seek workers to fill the positions in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The percentage of minorities or women among those promotable,  transferable, and trainable within the contractor's organization.  Trainable refers to those employees within the contractor's organization  who could, with appropriate training which the contractor is reasonably  able to provide, become promotable or transferable during the AAP year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The contractor must use the most current and discrete  statistical information available to derive availability figures.  Examples of such information include census data, data from local job  service offices, and data from colleges or other training institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contractor may not draw its reasonable recruitment area in  such a way as to have the effect of excluding minorities or women. For  each job group, the reasonable recruitment area must be identified, with  a brief explanation of the rationale for selection of that recruitment  area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The contractor may not define the pool of promotable,  transferable, and trainable employees in such a way as to have the  effect of excluding minorities or women. For each job group, the pool of  promotable, transferable, and trainable employees must be identified  with a brief explanation of the rationale for the selection of that  pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Where a job group is composed of job titles with different  availability rates, a composite availability figure for the job group  must be calculated. The contractor must separately determine the  availability for each job title within the job group and must determine  the proportion of job group incumbents employed in each job title. The  contractor must weight the availability for each job title by the  proportion of job group incumbents employed in that job group. The sum  of the weighted availability estimates for all job titles in the job  group must be the composite availability for the job group.</p>
