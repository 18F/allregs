                                Sec. 1.83-2  Election to include in gross income in year of transfer.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If property is transferred (within the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(a)) in connection with the performance of services, the person performing such services may elect to include in gross income under section 83(b) the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the property at the time of transfer (determined without regard to any lapse restriction, as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) over the amount (if any) paid for such property, as compensation for services. The fact that the transferee has paid full value for the property transferred, realizing no bargain element in the transaction, does not preclude the use of the election as provided for in this section. If this election is made, the substantial vesting rules of section 83(a) and the regulations thereunder do not apply with respect to such property, and except as otherwise provided in section 83(d)(2) and the regulations thereunder (relating to the cancellation of a nonlapse restriction), any subsequent appreciation in the value of the property is not taxable as compensation to the person who performed the services. Thus, property with respect to which this election is made shall be includible in gross income as of the time of transfer, even though such property is substantially nonvested (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) at the time of transfer, and no compensation will be includible in gross income when such property becomes substantially vested (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)). In computing the gain or loss from the subsequent sale or exchange of such property, its basis shall be the amount paid for the property increased by the amount included in gross income under section 83(b). If property for which a section 83(b) election is in effect is forfeited while substantially nonvested, such forfeiture shall be treated as a sale or exchange upon which there is realized a loss equal to the excess (if any) of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount paid (if any) for such property, over,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount realized (if any) upon such forfeiture.
If such property is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer, such loss shall be a capital loss. A sale or other disposition of the property that is in substance a forfeiture, or is made in contemplation of a forfeiture, shall be treated as a forfeiture under the two immediately preceding sentences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time for making election. Except as provided in the following sentence, the election referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date the property was transferred (or, if later, January 29, 1970) and may be filed prior to the date of transfer. Any statement filed before February 15, 1970, which was amended not later than February 16, 1970, in order to make it conform to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, shall be deemed a proper election under section 83(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner of making election. The election referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is made by filing one copy of a written statement with the internal revenue office with whom the person who performed the services files his return. In addition, one copy of such statement shall be submitted with this income tax return for the taxable year in which such property was transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional copies. The person who performed the services shall also submit a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) of this section to the person for whom the services are performed. In addition, if the person who performs the services and the transferee of such property are not the same person, the person who performs the services shall submit a copy of such statement to the transferee of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Content of statement. The statement shall be signed by the person making the election and shall indicate that it is being made under section 83(b) of the Code, and shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of each property with respect to which the election is being made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date or dates on which the property is tansferred and the taxable year (for example, ``calendar year 1970'' or ``fiscal year ending May 31, 1970'') for which such election was made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The nature of the restriction or restrictions to which the property is subject;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The fair market value at the time of transfer (determined without regard to any lapse restriction, as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) of each property with respect to which the election is being made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The amount (if any) paid for such property; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> With respect to elections made after July 21, 1978, a statement to the effect that copies have been furnished to other persons as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Revocability of election. An election under section 83(b) may not be revoked except with the consent of the Commissioner. Consent will be granted only in the case where the transferee is under a mistake of fact as to the underlying transaction and must be requested within 60 days of the date on which the mistake of fact first became known to the person who made the election. In any event, a mistake as to the value, or decline in the value, of the property with respect to which an election under section 83(b) has been made or a failure to perform an act contemplated at the time of transfer of such property does not constitute a mistake of fact.
