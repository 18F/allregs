                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Customer identification program: minimum requirements--(1) In general. A mutual fund must implement a written Customer Identification Program (``CIP'') appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a minimum, includes each of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. The CIP must be a part of the mutual fund's anti-money laundering program required under the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A mutual fund must implement a written Customer Identification Program (``CIP'') appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a minimum, includes each of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. The CIP must be a part of the mutual fund's anti-money laundering program required under the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identity verification procedures. The CIP must include risk-based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the extent reasonable and practicable. The procedures must enable the mutual fund to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer. The procedures must be based on the mutual fund's assessment of the relevant risks, including those presented by the manner in which accounts are opened, fund shares are distributed, and purchases, sales and exchanges are effected, the various types of accounts maintained by the mutual fund, the various types of identifying information available, and the mutual fund's customer base. At a minimum, these procedures must contain the elements described in this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Customer information required--(A) In general. The CIP must contain procedures for opening an account that specify the identifying information that will be obtained with respect to each customer. Except as permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a mutual fund must obtain, at a minimum, the following information prior to opening an account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Date of birth, for an individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Address, which shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For an individual, a residential or business street address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an individual who does not have a residential or business street address, an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or the residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust), a principal place of business, local office or other physical location; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identification number, which shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a U.S. person, a taxpayer identification number; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following: a taxpayer identification number; passport number and country of issuance; alien identification card number; or number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">When opening an account for a foreign business or enterprise that does not have an identification number, the mutual fund must request alternative government-issued documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a customer prior to opening an account, the CIP may include procedures for opening an account for a person that has applied for, but has not received, a taxpayer identification number. In this case, the CIP must include procedures to confirm that the application was filed before the person opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification number within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Customer verification. The CIP must contain procedures for verifying the identity of the customer, using the information obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, within a reasonable time after the account is opened. The procedures must describe when the mutual fund will use documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination of both methods as described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Verification through documents. For a mutual fund relying on documents, the CIP must contain procedures that set forth the documents that the mutual fund will use. These documents may include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For an individual, unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard,

such as a driver's license or passport; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued business license, a partnership agreement, or trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Verification through non-documentary methods. For a mutual fund relying on non-documentary methods, the CIP must contain procedures that describe the non-documentary methods the mutual fund will use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> These methods may include contacting a customer; independently verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references with other financial institutions; and obtaining a financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The mutual fund's non-documentary procedures must address situations where an individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or similar safeguard; the mutual fund is not familiar with the documents presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the customer opens the account without appearing in person; and where the mutual fund is otherwise presented with circumstances that increase the risk that the mutual fund will be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Additional verification for certain customers. The CIP must address situations where, based on the mutual fund's risk assessment of a new account opened by a customer that is not an individual, the mutual fund will obtain information about individuals with authority or control over such account, including persons authorized to effect transactions in the shareholder of record's account, in order to verify the customer's identity. This verification method applies only when the mutual fund cannot verify the customer's true identity using the verification methods described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for responding to circumstances in which the mutual fund cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer. These procedures should describe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When the mutual fund should not open an account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms under which a customer may use an account while the mutual fund attempts to verify the customer's identity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When the mutual fund should file a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When the mutual fund should close an account, after attempts to verify a customer's identity have failed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and maintaining a record of all information obtained under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All identifying information about a customer obtained under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the methods and the results of any measures undertaken to verify the identity of the customer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Retention of records. The mutual fund must retain the information in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for five years after the date the account is closed. The mutual fund must retain the information in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of this section for five years after the record is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include procedures for

determining whether the customer appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any Federal government agency and designated as such by the Department of the Treasury in consultation with the Federal functional regulators. The procedures must require the mutual fund to make such a determination within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened, or earlier, if required by another Federal law or regulation or Federal directive issued in connection with the applicable list. The procedures must also require the mutual fund to follow all Federal directives issued in connection with such lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for providing mutual fund customers with adequate notice that the mutual fund is requesting information to verify their identities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for providing mutual fund customers with adequate notice that the mutual fund is requesting information to verify their identities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the mutual fund generally describes the identification requirements of this section and provides the notice in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that a customer is able to view the notice, or is otherwise given notice, before opening an account. For example, depending on the manner in which the account is opened, a mutual fund may post a notice on its Web site, include the notice on its account applications, or use any other form of written or oral notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sample notice. If appropriate, a mutual fund may use the following sample language to provide notice to its customers:</p><p class="depth0">Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account</p><p class="depth0">To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.</p><p class="depth0">What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reliance on other financial institutions. The CIP may include procedures specifying when a mutual fund will rely on the performance by another financial institution (including an affiliate) of any procedures of the mutual fund's CIP, with respect to any customer of the mutual fund that is opening, or has opened, an account or has established a similar formal business relationship with the other financial institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other financial transactions, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The other financial institution is subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal functional regulator; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The other financial institution enters into a contract requiring it to certify annually to the mutual fund that it has implemented its anti-money laundering program, and that it (or its agent) will perform the specific requirements of the mutual fund's CIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions. The Commission, with the concurrence of the Secretary, may, by order or regulation, exempt any mutual fund or type of account from the requirements of this section. The Commission and the Secretary shall consider whether the exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act and is in the public interest, and may consider other appropriate factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other requirements unaffected. Nothing in this section relieves a mutual fund of its obligation to comply with any other provision in this chapter, including provisions concerning information that must be obtained, verified, or maintained in connection with any account or transaction.</p>
