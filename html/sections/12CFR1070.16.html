                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of  this section, and Sec. 1070.17 of this subpart, the CFPB shall respond  to requests according to their order of receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multitrack processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CFPB may establish separate  tracks to process simple and complex requests. The CFPB may assign a  request to the simple or complex track(s) based on the amount of work  and/or time needed to process the request. The CFPB shall process  requests in each track based on the date the request was perfected in  accordance with Sec. 1070.14(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CFPB may provide a requester in its complex track with an  opportunity to limit the scope of the request to qualify for faster  processing within the specified limits of the simple track(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period for responding to requests for records. Ordinarily,  the CFPB shall have twenty (20) business days from when a request is  received by the CFPB to determine whether to grant or deny a request for  records. The twenty (20) business day time period set forth in this  paragraph shall not be tolled by the CFPB except that the CFPB may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make one reasonable demand to the requester for clarifying  information about the request and toll the twenty (20) business day time  period while it awaits the clarifying information; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Toll the twenty (20) business day time period while it awaits  clarification from or addresses any dispute with the requester regarding  the assessment of fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the CFPB determines that due to  unusual circumstances it cannot respond either to a request within the  time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section or to an appeal  within the time period set forth in Sec. 1070.21 of this subpart, the  CFPB may extend the applicable time periods by informing the requester  in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which the  CFPB expects to complete its processing of the request or appeal. Any  extension or extensions of time with respect to a request or an appeal  shall not cumulatively total more than ten (10) business days. However,  if the CFPB determines that it needs additional time beyond a ten (10)  business day extension to process the request or appeal, then the CFPB  shall notify the requester and provide the requester with an opportunity  to limit the scope of the request or appeal or to arrange for an  alternative time frame for processing the request or appeal or a  modified request or appeal. The requester shall retain the right to  define the desired scope of the request or appeal, as long as it meets  the requirements contained in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in this paragraph, ``unusual circumstances'' means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the  office processing the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable   speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the  determination of the request, or among two or more CFPB offices having  substantial subject matter interest therein.</p>
