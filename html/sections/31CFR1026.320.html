                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Every futures commission merchant (``FCM'') and  introducing broker in commodities (``IB-C'') within the United States  shall file with FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required by this  section, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible  violation of law or regulation. An FCM or IB-C may also file with FinCEN  a report of any suspicious transaction that it believes is relevant to  the possible violation of any law or regulation but whose reporting is  not required by this section. Filing a report of a suspicious  transaction does not relieve an FCM or IB-C from the responsibility of  complying with any other reporting requirements imposed by the CFTC or  any registered futures association or registered entity as those terms  are defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7  U.S.C. 1a(29).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section  if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through an FCM or IB-C, it  involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000, and the  FCM or IB-C knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the  transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a  part):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or  conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from  illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature,  source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan  to violate or evade any Federal law or regulation or to avoid any  transaction reporting requirement under Federal law or regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to  evade any requirements of this chapter or of any other regulations  promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort  in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage,  and the FCM or IB-C knows of no reasonable explanation for the  transaction after examining the available facts, including the  background and possible purpose of the transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Involves use of the FCM or IB-C to facilitate criminal  activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The obligation to identify and properly and timely to report a  suspicious transaction rests with each FCM and IB-C involved in the  transaction, provided that no more than one report is required to be  filed by any of the FCMs or IB-Cs involved in a particular transaction,  so long as the report filed contains all relevant facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What to file. A suspicious transaction  shall be reported by completing a Suspicious Activity Report by  Securities and Futures Industries (``SAR-SF''), and collecting and  maintaining supporting documentation as required by paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where to file. The SAR-SF shall be filed with FinCEN in a  central location, to be determined by FinCEN, as indicated in the  instructions to the SAR-SF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When to file. A SAR-SF shall be filed no later than 30 calendar  days after the date of the initial detection by the reporting FCM or IB- C of facts   that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR-SF under this section. If  no suspect is identified on the date of such initial detection, an FCM  or IB-C may delay filing a SAR-SF for an additional 30 calendar days to  identify a suspect, but in no case shall reporting be delayed more than  60 calendar days after the date of such initial detection. In situations  involving violations that require immediate attention, such as terrorist  financing or ongoing money laundering schemes, the FCM or IB-C shall  immediately notify by telephone an appropriate law enforcement authority  in addition to filing timely a SAR-SF. FCMs and IB-Cs wishing  voluntarily to report suspicious transactions that may relate to  terrorist activity may call FinCEN's Financial Institutions Hotline at  1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing timely a SAR-SF if required by this  section. The FCM or IB-C may also, but is not required to, contact the  CFTC to report in such situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An FCM or IB-C is not required to file a SAR-SF  to report--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A robbery or burglary committed or attempted of the FCM or IB-C  that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A violation otherwise required to be reported under the CEA (7  U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the regulations of the CFTC (17 CFR chapter I), or  the rules of any registered futures association or registered entity as  those terms are defined in the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7 U.S.C. 1a(29), by  the FCM or IB-C or any of its officers, directors, employees, or  associated persons, other than a violation of 17 CFR 42.2, as long as  such violation is appropriately reported to the CFTC or a registered  futures association or registered entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Retention of records. An FCM or IB-C shall maintain a copy of  any SAR-SF filed and the original or business record equivalent of any  supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of  filing the SAR-SF. Supporting documentation shall be identified as such  and maintained by the FCM or IB-C, and shall be deemed to have been  filed with the SAR-SF. An FCM or IB-C shall make all supporting  documentation available to FinCEN or any Federal, State, or local law  enforcement agency, or any Federal regulatory authority that examines  the FCM or IB-C for compliance with the BSA, upon request; or to any  registered futures association or registered entity (as defined in the  Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))  (collectively, a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'')) that examines  the FCM or IB-C for compliance with the requirements of this section,  upon the request of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> only, a SAR shall include any suspicious activity  report filed with FinCEN pursuant to any regulation in this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prohibition on disclosures by futures commission merchants and  introducing brokers in commodities--(i) General rule.

A Federal,  State, local, territorial, or Tribal government authority, or any  director, officer, employee, or agent of any of the foregoing, shall not  disclose a SAR, or any information that would reveal the existence of a  SAR, except as necessary to fulfill official duties consistent with  Title II of the BSA. For purposes of this section, ``official duties''  shall not include the disclosure of a SAR, or any information that would  reveal the existence of a SAR, in response to a request for disclosure  of non-public information or a request for use in a private legal  proceeding, including a request pursuant to 31 CFR 1.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prohibition on disclosures by Self-Regulatory Organizations.

An FCM or IB-C, and any director,  officer, employee, or agent of any FCM or IB-C, that makes a voluntary  disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation to a  government agency or makes a disclosure pursuant to this section or any  other authority, including a disclosure made jointly with another  institution, shall be protected from liability to any person for any  such disclosure, or for failure to provide notice of such disclosure to  any person identified in the disclosure, or both, to the full extent  provided by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Compliance. FCMs or IB-Cs shall be examined by FinCEN or its  delegatees for compliance with this section.
