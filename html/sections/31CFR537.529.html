L. 107-56) (USA PATRIOT Act) do not apply to the operation of correspondent accounts for Burmese financial institutions, or to transactions that are conducted through those accounts, provided the Burmese financial institution is not an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec. 537.201(a) and the transactions are otherwise authorized by this part, and therefore fall within the exception set forth in 31 CFR 1010.651(b)(3). In addition, section 537.531 of this part authorizes certain transactions involving specific Burmese financial institutions whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this part.
