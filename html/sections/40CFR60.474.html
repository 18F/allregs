For a saturator, the sampling time and sample  volume for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and 3.00 dscm (106  dscf), and for the blowing still, at least 90 minutes or the duration of  the coating blow or non-coating blow, whichever is greater, and 2.25  dscm (79.4 dscf).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the saturator, the asphalt roofing production rate (P) for  each run shall be determined as follows: The amount of asphalt roofing  produced on the shingle or saturated felt process lines shall be  obtained by direct measurement. The asphalt roofing production rate is  the amount produced divided by the time taken for the run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the blowing still, the asphalt charging rate (P) shall be  computed for each run using the following equation:  P=(Vd)/(K' [thetas])  where:  P=asphalt charging rate to blowing still, Mg/hr (ton/hr). V=volume of asphalt charged, m\3\ (ft\3\). d=density of asphalt, kg/m\3\ (lb/ft\3\).   K'=conversion factor, 1000 kg/Mg (2000 lb/ton).

To obtain this opacity standard, the owner or operator must  request the Administrator to determine opacity during an initial, or  subsequent, performance test when fuel oil is used to fire the  afterburner. Upon receipt of the results of the performance test, the  Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with the mass  standard for the blowing still. If the Administrator finds that the  facility was in compliance with the mass standard during the performance  test but failed to meet the zero opacity standard, the Administrator  will establish and promulgate in the Federal Register an opacity  standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when  fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. When the afterburner is fired  with natural gas, the zero percent opacity remains the applicable  opacity standard.
