                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraisals required. An appraisal performed by a State certified  or licensed appraiser is required for all real estate-related financial  transactions except those in which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transaction value is $250,000 or less;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A lien on real property has been taken as collateral through an  abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction as a  consequence have not been made more favorable than they would have been  in the absence of a lien;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the  real estate's value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the  economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased real estate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the  credit union, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds  necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There has been no obvious and material change in market  conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the  adequacy of the credit union's real estate collateral protection after  the transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The transaction involves the purchase, sale, investment in,  exchange of, or extension of credit secured by, a loan or interest in a  loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgage- backed securities, and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or  real property interest met the requirements of this regulation, if  applicable, at the time of origination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by  a United States government agency or United States government sponsored  agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The transaction either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Qualifies for sale to a United States government agency or  United States government sponsored agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the  appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage Association or  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to  that category of real estate; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The regional director has granted a waiver from the appraisal  requirement for a category of loans meeting the definition of a member  business loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transactions requiring a State-certified appraiser. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (All  transactions of $1,000,000 or more) All federally related transactions  having a transaction value of $1,000,000 or more shall require an  appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (Nonresidential transactions) All federally related transactions  having a transaction value of more than $250,000, other than those  involving appraisals of 1- to 4-family residential properties, shall  require an appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> (Complex residential transactions of $250,000 or more) All  complex 1- to 4-family residential property appraisals rendered in  connection with federally   related transactions shall require a state-certified appraiser if the  transaction value is $250,000 or more. A regulated institution may  presume that appraisals of 1- to 4-family residential properties are not  complex unless the institution has readily available information that a  given appraisal will be complex. The regulated institution shall be  responsible for making the final determination of whether the appraisal  is complex. If, during the course of the appraisal, a licensed appraiser  identifies factors that would result in the property, form of ownership,  or market conditions being considered atypical, then either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to  complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and cosign  the appraisal; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete  the appraisal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transactions requiring either a State-certified or -licensed  appraiser. All appraisals for federally related transactions not  requiring the services of a state-certified appraiser shall be prepared  by either a state-certified appraiser or a state-licensed appraiser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Valuation requirement. Secured transactions exempted from  appraisal requirements pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) of this  section and not otherwise exempted from this regulation or fully insured  shall be supported by a written estimate of market value, as defined in  this regulation, performed by an individual having no direct or indirect  interest in the property, and qualified and experienced to perform such  estimates of value for the type and amount of credit being considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appraisals to address safety and soundness concerns. NCUA  reserves the right to require an appraisal under this subpart whenever  the agency believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness  concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Higher-priced mortgage loans. A credit union may not extend  credit to a consumer in the form of a ``higher-priced mortgage loan'' as  defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(a)(1), without meeting the requirements of  section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1639h, and its  implementing regulations in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.35(c).
