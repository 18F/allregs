                            <p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1990, Public  Law 101-552, as reauthorized by the Administrative Dispute Resolution  Act (ADRA) of 1996, Public Law 104-320, authorizes and encourages  agencies to use mediation, conciliation, arbitration, and other  techniques for the prompt and informal resolution of disputes, either  before or after appeal, and for other purposes. ADR procedures may be  used when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is mutual consent by the parties to participate in the ADR  process (with consent being obtained either before or after an issue in  controversy has arisen);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the submission of a claim; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In resolution of a formal claim. Use of ADR shall be coordinated  with counsel. For all matters filed with the DOTBCA, the DOTBCA  Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures contained in 48 CFR  Chapter 63, Section 6302.30, ADR Methods (Rule 30), will be distributed  to the parties, if ADR procedures are used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Pursuant to the ADRA, DOT has appointed a Dispute Resolution  Specialist, who is responsible for the operations of the Center for  Alternative Dispute Resolution, (C-4). The Center may provide an  internal DOT neutral agreeable to the parties to conduct any of the  alternative means of dispute resolution set forth in the ADRA, 5 U.S.C.  571(3) on a non-reimbursable basis for DOT operating administrations and  their contracting partners. Alternative means of dispute resolution  include settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation,  fact finding, mini-trials, and arbitration, or any combination of these  methods. The Center may also arrange for an external public or private  neutral at the parties' expense.</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER F_SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF CONTRACTING</p>
