Sec. 905.52 and 905.53 and the regulations issued thereunder, ship any variety for the following purposes: (a) To a charitable institution for consumption by such institution; (b) to a relief agency for distribution by such agency; (c) to a commercial processor for conversion by such processor into canned or frozen products or into a beverage base; (d) by parcel post; or (e) in such minimum quantities, types of shipments, or for such purposes as the committee with the approval of the Secretary may specify. No assessment shall be levied on fruit so shipped. The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe such rules, regulations, or safeguards as it may deem necessary to prevent varieties handled under the provisions of this section from entering channels of trade for other than the purposes authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and safeguards may include the requirements that handlers shall file applications with the committee for authorization to handle a variety pursuant to this section, and that such applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser or receiver that the variety will not be used for any purpose not authorized by this section.
