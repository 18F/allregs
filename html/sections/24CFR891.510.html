                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Minimizing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and  objectives of subpart E of this part, Sponsors and Borrowers shall  assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the  displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit  organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under  subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Relocation assistance for displaced persons. A displaced person  (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation  assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the  requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property  Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201- 4655), as implemented by 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person shall be  advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601- 3619). If the comparable replacement dwellings are located in areas of  minority concentration, minority persons also must be given, if  possible, referrals to suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement  dwellings not located in such areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Real property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real  property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements  described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Appeals. A person who disagrees with the Sponsor's/Borrower's  determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced  person,'' or with the amount of relocation assistance for which the  person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with  the Sponsor/Borrower. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the  Sponsor's/Borrower's determination on his or her appeal may submit a  written request for review of that determination to the HUD field  office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Responsibility of Sponsor/Borrower. The Sponsor/Borrower shall  certify that it will comply (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as  required by 49 CFR part 24) with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part  24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such  compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to  comply with these provisions. The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain  records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the  provisions of this section. The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain data on  the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definition of a displaced person. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this  section, the term   displaced person means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit  organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal  property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of  acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under  this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted  project including any permanent move from the real property that is  made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> After notice by the Sponsor/Borrower to move permanently from  the property if the move occurs on or after:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of the submission of an application to HUD that is  later approved, if the Sponsor has control of an appropriate site; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date that the Sponsor obtains control of an approvable site,  if such control is obtained after the submission of an application to  HUD:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this  section, if the Sponsor, Borrower or HUD determines that the  displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or  demolition for the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the  following three situations occurs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tenant moves after execution of the Agreement between the  Sponsor/Borrower and HUD, and the move occurs before the tenant is  provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and  occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same  building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms  and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly  rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the  greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility  costs before the Agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 813.107, if  the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if  the tenant is not low-income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return  to the building/complex, and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The tenant is required to move to another dwelling in the same  building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other  conditions of the move are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this  section, however, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person''  (and is not eligible for relocation assistance at URA levels), if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or  repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy  agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or  other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not  undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide  relocation assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person moved into the property after the submission of the  application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was  provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the  person (e.g., displacement, temporary relocation or a rent increase) and  the fact that he or she will not qualify as a displaced person as a  result of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct  result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Sponsor/Borrower may request, at any time, a HUD  determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this  section.</p>
