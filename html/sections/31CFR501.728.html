                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability; procedure. In connection with any hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, either the respondent or the Director may request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses at the designated time and place of hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence returnable at a designated time and place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant to Sec. 501.705.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for issuance. If it appears to the Administrative Law Judge that a subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the Administrative Law Judge determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue a modified subpoena as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination, the Administrative Law Judge may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be proved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service. Service of a subpoena shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 501.705.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application to quash or modify--(1) Procedure. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed or who is an owner, creator or the subject of the documents or materials that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but not later than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, request that the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served on all parties pursuant to Sec. 501.705. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued may, not later than 5 days after service of the application, file an opposition to the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed or who is an owner, creator or the subject of the documents or materials that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but not later than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, request that the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served on all parties pursuant to Sec. 501.705. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued may, not later than 5 days after service of the application, file an opposition to the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards governing application to quash or modify. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly burdensome, the Administrative Law Judge may quash or modify the subpoena, or may order return of the subpoena only upon specified conditions. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable compensation to the person to whom the subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for return of the subpoena.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned to appear at a proceeding shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear.</p>
