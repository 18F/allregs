                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the requirements of section 4.4 of E.O.  12958, as amended, we may grant access to classified information to  certain eligible persons. These persons are engaged in historical  research projects or previously occupied policy-making positions to  which they were appointed by the President. If you seek permission to  examine materials under this special historical researcher/Presidential  appointees access program, you must contact NARA in advance. We need at  least 4 months before you wish to have access to the materials to permit  time for the responsible agencies to process your request for access. If  you seek access to classified Presidential records under section 4.4 of  E.O. 12958, you must first qualify under special access provisions of 44  U.S.C. 2205. NARA informs you of the agencies to which you have to apply  for permission to examine classified information, including classified  information originated by the White House or classified information in  the custody of the National Archives which was originated by a defunct  agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may examine records under this program only after the  originating or responsible agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determines in writing that access is consistent with the  interest of national security; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from  unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information  is safeguarded in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12958, as  amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The originating or responsible agency limits the access granted  to former Presidential and Vice Presidential appointees to items that  the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as an  appointee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To protect against the possibility of unauthorized access to  restricted documents, a director may issue instructions supplementing  the research room rules provided in 36 CFR part 1254.</p>
