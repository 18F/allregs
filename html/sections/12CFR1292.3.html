                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this part is to identify targeted community lending projects that the Banks may support through the establishment of CICA programs under section 10(j)(10) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(10)). Pursuant to this part, a Bank may offer RDF or UDF programs, or both, for targeted community lending using the targeted beneficiaries or targeted income levels specified in Sec.  1292.1, without prior FHFA approval. A Bank also may offer other CICA programs for targeted community lending using targeted beneficiaries and targeted income levels other than those specified in Sec.  1292.1, established by the Bank with the prior approval of FHFA. In addition, a Bank shall offer CICA programs under section 10(i) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(i)) (Community Investment Program (CIP)) and section 10(j) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(j)) (AHP). A Bank may provide advances or grants under its CICA programs except for CIP programs, under which a Bank may only provide advances.</p>
