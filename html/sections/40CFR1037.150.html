                            <p class="depth0">The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> apply with respect to vehicles produced in model years  before 2014. Manufacturers may voluntarily certify in model year 2013  (or earlier model years for electric vehicles) to the greenhouse gas  standards of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> applies for regulatory sub-categories  subject to the standards of Sec.  1037.105 or Sec.  1037.106. Except as  specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to generate early credits  under this paragraph for any vehicles other than electric vehicles, you  must certify your entire U.S.-directed production volume within the  regulatory sub-category to these standards. Except as specified in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section, if some vehicle families within a  regulatory sub-category are certified after the start of the model year,  you may generate credits only for production that occurs after all  families are certified. For example, if you produce three vehicle  families in an averaging set and you receive your certificates for those  families on January 4, 2013, March 15, 2013, and April 24, 2013, you may  not generate credits for model year 2013 production in any of the  families that occurs before April 24, 2013. Calculate credits relative  to the standard that would apply in model year 2014 using the equations  in subpart H of this part. You may bank credits equal to the surplus  credits you generate under this paragraph (a) multiplied by 1.50. For  example, if you have 1.0 Mg of surplus credits for model year 2013, you  may bank 1.5 Mg of credits. Credit deficits for an averaging set prior  to model year 2014 do not carry over to model year 2014. These credits  may be used to show compliance with the standards of this part for 2014  and later model years. We recommend that you notify EPA of your intent  to use this provision before submitting your applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for any vehicles other than electric  vehicles, you must certify your entire U.S.-directed fleet to these  standards. If you calculate a separate fleet average for advanced- technology vehicles under Sec.  1037.104(c)(7), you must certify your  entire U.S.-directed production volume of both advanced and conventional  vehicles within the fleet. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of  this section, if some test groups are   certified after the start of the model year, you may generate credits  only for production that occurs after all test groups are certified. For  example, if you produce three test groups in an averaging set and you  receive your certificates for those test groups on January 4, 2013,  March 15, 2013, and April 24, 2013, you may not generate credits for  model year 2013 for vehicles from any of the test groups produced before  April 24, 2013. Calculate credits relative to the standard that would  apply in model year 2014 using the applicable equations in 40 CFR part  86 and your model year 2013 U.S.-directed production volumes. These  credits may be used to show compliance with the standards of this part  for 2014 and later model years. We recommend that you notify us of your  intent to use this provision before submitting your applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> multiplied by 1.50. Your 2012 and 2013 model years must  be equivalent in length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> applies where you do not receive your  final certificate in a regulatory sub-category within 30 days of  submitting your final application for that sub-category. Calculate your  credits for all production that occurs 30 days or more after you submit  your final application for the sub-category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phase-in provisions. Each manufacturer must choose one of the  following options for phasing in the standards of Sec.  1037.104:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the  standards in Sec.  1037.104 apply as specified for model year 2018, with  compliance for vehicles in model years 2014 through 2017 based on the  CO2 target values specified in the following table:</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Sec.   1037.150 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Model year and engine cycle         Alternate CO2 target (g/mile) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2014 Spark-Ignition................

The air  conditioning leakage standard of Sec.  1037.115 does not apply for  vocational vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Model year 2014 N2O standards. In model year 2014 and  earlier, manufacturers may show compliance with the N2O  standards using an engineering analysis. This allowance also applies for  later test groups families carried over from model 2014 consistent with  the provisions of 40 CFR 86.1839. You may not certify to an  N2O FEL different than the standard without measuring  N2O emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Electric vehicles. All electric vehicles are deemed to have zero  emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. No  emission testing is required for electric vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Off-road vehicle exemption. In unusual circumstances, vehicle  manufacturers may ask us to exempt vehicles under Sec.  1037.631 based  on other criteria that are equivalent to those specified in Sec.   1037.631(a). For example, we would normally not grant relief in cases  where the vehicle manufacturer had credits or other compliant tires were  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Credit multiplier for advanced technology. If you generate  credits from vehicles certified with advanced technology, you may  multiply these credits by 1.50, except that you may not apply this  multiplier in addition to the early-credit multiplier of paragraph (a)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Limited prohibition related to early model year engines. The  prohibition in Sec.  1037.601 against introducing into U.S. commerce a  vehicle containing an engine not certified to the standards of this part  does not apply for vehicles using model year 2014 or 2015 spark-ignition  engines, or any model year 2013 or earlier engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Verifying drag areas from in-use vehicles. We may measure the  drag area of your vehicles after they have been placed into service.  Your vehicle conforms to the regulations of this part with respect to  aerodynamic performance if we measure its drag area to be at or below  the maximum drag area allowed for the bin to which that configuration  was certified. To account for measurement variability, your vehicle is  also deemed to conform to the regulations of this part with respect to  aerodynamic performance if we measure its drag area to at or below the  maximum drag area allowed for the bin above the bin to which you  certified (for example, Bin II if you certified the vehicle to Bin III),  unless we determine that you knowingly produced the vehicle to have a  higher drag area than is allowed for the bin to which it was certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> does not affect how you may or  may not certify with respect to criteria pollutants. For example,  certifying a Class 4 vehicle under this paragraph does not allow you to  chassis-certify these vehicles with respect to criteria emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may certify complete or cab-complete spark-ignition vehicles  to the standards of Sec.  1037.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. This means the complete sister vehicle may be a  carryover vehicle from a prior model year or a vehicle created solely  for the purpose of testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, you may not submit the test data from that complete  sister vehicle and must perform the test on the cab-complete vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em>, engines would not  be considered to be identical if they used different engine hardware.  You may include such engines in a test group certified to the standards  of Sec.  1037.104, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines certified under this paragraph (m) are deemed to be  certified to the standards of 40 CFR 1036.108 as specified in 40 CFR  1036.108(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The U.S.-directed production volume of engines you sell as loose  engines or installed in incomplete heavy-duty vehicles that are not cab- complete vehicles in any given model year may not exceed ten percent of  the total U.S.-directed production volume of engines of that design that  you produce for heavy-duty applications for that model year, including  engines you produce for complete vehicles, cab-complete vehicles, and  other incomplete vehicles. The total number of engines you may certify  under this paragraph (m), of all engine designs, may not exceed 15,000  in any model year. Engines produced in excess of either of these limits  are not covered by your certificate. For example, if you produce 80,000  complete model year 2017 Class 2b pickup trucks with a certain engine  and 10,000 incomplete model year 2017 Class 3 vehicles with that same  engine, and you do not apply the provisions of this paragraph (m) to any  other engine designs, you may produce up to 10,000 engines of that  design for sale as loose engines under this paragraph (m). If you  produced 11,000 engines of that design for sale as loose engines, the  last 1,000 of them that you produced in that model year 2017 would be  considered uncertified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph (m) does not apply for engines certified to the  standards of 40 CFR 1036.108(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>.''  List the test group name instead of an engine family name.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Vehicles using engines certified under this paragraph (m) are  subject to the emission standards of Sec.  1037.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If one or more of the CO2 test results exceed the  applicable target value, use the CO2 target value and test  result of the vehicle that exceeds its target value by the greatest  amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If none of the CO2 test results exceed the  applicable target value, select the highest target value and set the  test result equal to it. This means that you may not generate emission  credits from vehicles certified under this paragraph (m).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> State in your applications for certification that your test  group and engine family will include engines certified under this  paragraph (m). This applies for your greenhouse gas vehicle test group  and your criteria pollutant engine family. List in each application the  name of the corresponding test group/engine family.
