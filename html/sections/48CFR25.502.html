Otherwise, evaluate in accordance with agency procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If there were no offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products, make a nonavailability determination (see 25.103(b)(2)) and award on the low offer (see 25.403(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For acquisitions not covered by the WTO GPA, but subject to the Buy American statute (an FTA or the

Israeli Trade Act also may apply), the following applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the low offer is a domestic offer or an eligible offer under NAFTA or the Israeli Trade Act, award on that offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the low offer is a noneligible offer and there were no domestic offers (see 25.103(b)(3)), award on the low offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the low offer is a noneligible offer and there is an eligible offer that is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low offer.
