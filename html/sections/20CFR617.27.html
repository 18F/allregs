                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. A trainee under this subpart C shall be afforded supplemental assistance necessary to pay costs of separate maintenance when the training facility is located outside the commuting area, but may not receive such supplemental assistance for any period for which the trainee receives such a payment under the Workforce Investment Act, or any other law, or for any day referred to under Sec. 617.28(c)(3) pursuant to which a transportation allowance is payable to the individual, or to the extent the individual is entitled to be paid or reimbursed for such expenses from any other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount. Subsistence payments shall not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual's actual per diem expenses for subsistence; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 50 percent of the prevailing per diem rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations (see 41 CFR part 101-7) for the locale of the training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications. Applications for subsistence payments shall be filed in accordance with this subpart C and on forms which shall be furnished to trainees by the State agency. Such payments shall be made on completion of a week of training, except that at the beginning of a training project a State agency may advance a payment for a week if it determines that such advance is necessary to enable a trainee to accept training. An adjustment shall be made if the amount of an advance is less or more than the amount to which the trainee is entitled under paragraph (b) of this section. A determination as to an application made under this section shall be subject to Sec. Sec. 617.50 and 617.51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unexcused absences. No subsistence payment shall be made to an individual for any day of unexcused absence as certified by the responsible training facility.
