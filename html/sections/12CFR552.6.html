                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Shareholder meetings. An annual meeting of the shareholders of the association for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the association shall be held annually within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or by such other persons as may be

specified in the bylaws of the association. All annual and special meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place as the board of directors may determine in the state in which the association has its principal place of business, or at any other convenient place the board of directors may designate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice of shareholder meetings. Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned shall not be subject to the shareholder notice requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fixing of record date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Voting lists. (1) At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for the shares of the association shall make a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the association and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder of record or the stockholder's agent during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book shall constitute prima facie evidence of the stockholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned shall not be subject to the voting list requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is entitled to vote on such matter and who shall defray the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the association in performance of the act or acts required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Shareholder quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the association entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders,

unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders voting together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter. Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election of directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Shareholder voting--(1) Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, at all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. A proxy may designate as holder a corporation, partnership or company as defined in Part 574 of this chapter, or other person. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Shares controlled by association. Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the association nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the association, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Nominations and new business submitted by shareholders. Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders shall be voted upon at the annual meeting if such nominations or new business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the association at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Ballots bearing the names of all the persons nominated shall be provided for use at the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Informal action by stockholders. If the bylaws of the association so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.
[54 FR 49523, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 18476, Apr. 19, 1994; 61 FR 64019, Dec. 3, 1996]


Sec. 552.6-1  Board of directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General powers and duties. The business and affairs of the association shall be under the direction of its board of directors. The board of directors shall annually elect a chairman of the board from among its members and shall designate the chairman of the board, when present, to preside at its meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless the bylaws so require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Number and term. The bylaws shall set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors shall be not fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the Director of the Office or his or her delegate. Directors shall be elected for a term of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. If a staggered board is chosen, the directors shall be divided into two or three classes as nearly equal in number as possible and one class shall be elected by ballot annually. In the case of a converting or newly chartered association where all directors shall be elected at the first election of directors, if a staggered board is chosen, the terms shall be staggered in length from one to three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Regular meetings. A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be held immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders. The board of directors shall determine the place, frequency, time and procedure for notice of regular meetings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Quorum. A majority of the number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of

the remaining directors although less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Removal or resignation of directors. (1) At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be removed only for cause, as defined in Sec. 563.39 of this chapter, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Associations may provide for procedures regarding resignations in the bylaws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal would be sufficient to elect a director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever the holders of the shares of any class are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the charter or supplemental sections thereto, the provisions of this section shall apply, in respect to the removal of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Executive and other committees. The board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full board, may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees each of which, to the extent provided in the resolution or bylaws of the association, shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the board of directors, except no committee shall have the authority of the board of directors with reference to: the declaration of dividends; the amendment of the charter or bylaws of the association; recommending to the stockholders a plan of merger, consolidation, or conversion; the sale, lease, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of the association otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; a voluntary dissolution of the association; a revocation of any of the foregoing; or the approval of a transaction in which any member of the executive committee, directly or indirectly, has any material beneficial interest. The designation of any committee and the delegation of authority thereto shall not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any director, of any responsibility imposed by law or regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notice of special meetings. Written notice of at least 24 hours regarding any special meeting of the board of directors or of any committee designated thereby shall be given to each director in accordance with the bylaws, although such notice may be waived by the director. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. The bylaws may provide for telephonic participation at a meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Action without a meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, shall be signed by all of the directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Presumption of assent. A director of the association who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any association matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent or abstention shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless a written dissent to such action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the secretary of the association within five days after the date on which a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent shall not apply to

a director who voted in favor of such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Age limitation on directors. A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for directors. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules and regulations.
[54 FR 49523, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 4312, Jan. 14, 1993; 61 FR 64020, Dec. 3, 1996; 62 FR 66262, Dec. 18, 1997]


Sec. 552.6-2  Officers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Positions. The officers of the association shall be a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom shall be elected by the board of directors. The board of directors may also designate the chairman of the board as an officer. The offices of the secretary and treasurer or comptroller may be held by the same person and the vice president may also be either the secretary or the treasurer or comptroller. The board of directors may designate one or more vice presidents as executive vice president or senior vice president. The board of directors may also elect or authorize the appointment of such other officers as the business of the association may require. The officers shall have such authority and perform such duties as the board of directors may from time to time authorize or determine. In the absence of action by the board of directors, the officers shall have such powers and duties as generally pertain to their respective offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Removal. Any officer may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the association will be served thereby; but such removal, other than for cause, shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. Employment contracts shall conform with Sec. 563.39 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Age limitation on officers. A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for officers. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules, and regulations.
[54 FR 49523, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 56 FR 59866, Nov. 26, 1991; 60 FR 66869, Dec. 27, 1995; 61 FR 64020, Dec. 3, 1996]


Sec. 552.6-3  Certificates for shares and their transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certificates for shares. Certificates representing shares of capital stock of the association shall be in such form as shall be determined by the board of directors and approved by the OTS. The certificates shall be signed by the chief executive officer or by any other officer of the association authorized by the board of directors, attested by the secretary or an assistant secretary, and sealed with the corporate seal or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of such officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent or a registrar other than the association itself or one of its employees. Each certificate for shares of capital stock shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates surrendered to the association for transfer shall be cancelled and no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled, except that in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of directors may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transfer of shares. Transfer of shares of capital stock of the association shall be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority for such transfer shall be given only by the holder of record or by a legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of such authority, or by an attorney authorized by a duly executed power of attorney and filed with the association. The transfer shall be made only on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the association shall be deemed by the association to be the owner for all purposes.
