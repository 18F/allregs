                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Only non-binding, voluntary ADR will be used to attempt to resolve a Pre-dispute pursuant to Sec. 17.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ADR conducted under this subpart is subject to the confidentiality requirements of Sec. 17.39.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 17--Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</p><p class="depth2">A. The FAA dispute resolution procedures encourage the parties to protests and contract disputes to use ADR as the primary means to resolve protests and contract disputes, pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, Public Law 104-320, 5 U.S.C. 570-579, and Department of Transportation and FAA policies to utilize ADR to the maximum extent practicable. Under the procedures presented in this part, the ODRA encourages parties to consider ADR techniques such as case evaluation, mediation, or arbitration.</p><p class="depth2">B. ADR encompasses a number of processes and techniques for resolving protests or contract disputes. The most commonly used types include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Mediation. The neutral or compensated neutral ascertains the needs and interests of both parties and facilitates discussions between or among the parties and an amicable resolution of their differences, seeking approaches to bridge the gaps between the parties'' respective positions. The neutral or compensated neutral can meet with the parties separately, conduct joint meetings with the parties'' representatives, or employ both methods in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Neutral Evaluation. At any stage during the ADR process, as the parties may agree, the neutral or compensated neutral will provide a candid assessment and opinion of the

strengths and weaknesses of the parties'' positions as to the facts and law, so as to facilitate further discussion and resolution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Binding Arbitration. The ODRA, after consultation with the United States Department of Justice in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act offers true binding arbitration in cases within its jurisdiction. The ODRA's Guidance for the Use of Binding Arbitration may be found on its website at: http://www.faa.gov/go/odra.</p><p class="depth4">SUBCHAPTER C_AIRCRAFT</p>
