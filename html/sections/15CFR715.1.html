                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Declaration of production by synthesis of UDOCs for purposes not  prohibited by the CWC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Production quantities that trigger the  declaration requirement. See Sec. 711.6 of the CWCR for information on  obtaining the forms you will need to declare production of unscheduled  discrete organic chemicals. You must complete the forms specified in  paragraph (b) of this section if your plant site produced by synthesis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In excess of 200 metric tons aggregate of all UDOCs (including  all UDOCs containing the elements phosphorus, sulfur or fluorine,  referred to as ``PSF chemicals'') during the previous calendar year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In excess of 30 metric tons of an individual PSF chemical at  one or more plants at your plant site during the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 715.1(a)(1)(ii): In calculating the aggregate  production quantity of each individual PSF chemical produced by a PSF  plant, do not include production of a PSF chemical that was produced in  quantities less than 30 metric tons. Include only production quantities  from those PSF plants that produced more than 30 metric tons of an  individual PSF chemical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> UDOCs subject to declaration requirements under this part. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  UDOCs subject to declaration requirements under this part are those  produced by synthesis that have been isolated for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sale as a specific end product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exemptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Polymers and oligomers consisting of two or  more repeating units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Chemicals and chemical mixtures produced through a biological or  biomediated process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Products from the refining of crude oil, including sulfur- containing crude oil;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Metal carbides (i.e., chemicals consisting only of metal and  carbon); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> UDOCs produced by synthesis that are ingredients or by-products  in   foods designed for consumption by humans and/or animals.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 715.1(a)(2): See Supplement No. 2 to this part 715 for  examples of UDOCs subject to the declaration requirements of this part,  and for examples of activities that are not considered production by  synthesis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exemptions for UDOC plant sites. UDOC plant sites that  exclusively produced hydrocarbons or explosives are exempt from UDOC  declaration requirements. For the purposes of this part, the following  definitions apply for hydrocarbons and explosives:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hydrocarbon means any organic compound that contains only carbon  and hydrogen; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explosive means a chemical (or a mixture of chemicals) that is  included in Class 1 of the United Nations Organization hazard  classification system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. Attach Form A as  appropriate; Form B is optional.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 715.1(b)(1): If there is a change in the inspection  status of your plant site, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, you may submit an Annual Declaration on Past Activities, in  lieu of a Change in Inspection Status Form, under the circumstances  described in Note 3 to paragraph (d)(2). In this case, the due date for  submitting the Annual Declaration on Past Activities to BIS, covering  UDOC production at your plant site during the current calendar year,  would be December 15th of the current calendar year, instead of February  28th of the next calendar year (also see Supplement No. 3 to this part).  If you choose to submit your Annual Declaration on Past Activities to  BIS by December 15th and, subsequently, you determine that the  production by synthesis of UDOCs at your plant site actually exceeded  the UDOC inspection threshold level specified in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section, you must submit an amendment to your Annual Declaration on  Past Activities (see Sec. 715.2 of the CWCR) and indicate, on Form B,  the reason your plant site exceeded the UDOC inspection threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No Changes Authorization Form. You may complete the No Changes  Authorization Form if there are no updates or changes to any information  (except the certifying official and dates signed and submitted) in your  plant site's previously submitted annual declaration on past activities.  Your plant site's activities will be declared to the OPCW and subject to  inspection, if applicable, based upon the data reported in the most  recent UDOC Declaration that you submitted to BIS.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 715.1(b)(2): If, after submitting the No Changes  Authorization Form, you have changes to information, you must submit a  complete amendment to the annual declaration on past activities. See  Sec. 715.2 of the CWCR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ``Declared'' UDOC plant site. A plant site that submitted a  declaration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a  ``declared'' UDOC plant site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Routine inspections of declared UDOC plant sites--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspection  requirement. A ``declared'' UDOC plant site is subject to routine  inspection by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW) (see part 716 of the CWCR) if it produced by synthesis more than  200 metric tons aggregate of UDOCs during the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change in inspection status. You may complete the Change in  Inspection Status Form, to ensure that your facility does not remain  subject to inspection during the first 90 days of the next calendar year  (i.e., prior to the submission of the U.S. declaration to the OPCW), if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Your plant site is currently subject to inspection, pursuant to  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, based on your plant site's production  by synthesis of UDOCs during the previous calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your plant site's production by synthesis of UDOCs in the  current calendar year will be below the inspection threshold level  specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section by the deadline indicated  in Supplement No. 3 to this part, and is anticipated to remain below  that threshold level through the remainder of the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1 to Sec. 715.1(d)(2): Upon receipt of the Change in  Inspection Status Form, BIS will inform the Organization for the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) that your plant site is not  subject to inspection during the next calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2 to Sec. 715.1(d)(2): If, after submitting your Change in  Inspection Status Form to BIS, you determine that the production by  synthesis of UDOCs at your plant site actually exceeded the UDOC  inspection threshold level specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, you must indicate this fact when you submit your Annual  Declaration on Past Activities to BIS and indicate, on Form B, the  reason your plant site exceeded the UDOC inspection threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Note 3 to Sec. 715.1(d)(2): You may submit the Annual Declaration  on Past Activities described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  instead of the Change in Inspection Status Form, if you anticipate that  UDOC production at your plant site during the current calendar year will  be below the inspection threshold level specified in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section, but you expect your plant site to remain subject to the  UDOC declaration requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In  this case, the due date for the Annual Declaration on Past Activities  will be December 15th of the current calendar year, instead of February  28th of the next calendar year. Note that any changes to information  contained in the Annual Declaration on Past Activities must be addressed  in accordance with the amendment requirements in Sec. 715.2 of the  CWCR. For example, if subsequent to the submission of your Annual  Declaration on Past Activities to BIS on December 15th, you determine  that the production by synthesis of UDOCs at your plant site actually  exceeded the UDOC inspection threshold level specified in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, you must submit an amendment to your Annual  Declaration on Past Activities (see Sec. 715.2 of the CWCR) and  indicate, on Form B, the reason your plant site exceeded the UDOC  inspection threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Note 4 to Sec. 715.1(d)(2): Currently inspectable UDOC plant sites  that do not submit either a Change in Inspection Status Form or Annual  Declaration of Past Activities by December 15th of the current calendar  year, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, will remain  subject to inspection through at least the 90-day period at the  beginning of the next calendar year.
