                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board may administratively undertake collection by offset on  each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in accordance with  the guidelines and the standards contained in 4 CFR 102.2, 102.3, and  102.4 and 5 U.S.C. 5514, as applicable. The Board may not initiate  administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the  Government's right to the debt first accrued, unless facts material to  the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not  reasonably have been known to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from the  Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Federal Employees  Retirement System, or other similar fund is made pursuant to 4 CFR 102.4  and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Salary offset is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following procedures apply when the Board seeks to collect a  debt by offset against any payment to be made to a debtor or against the  assets of a holder of a certificate, permit, license, or authorization  issued by the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the offset is made, the Board shall provide the debtor  written notice of the nature and amount of the debt and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice of the Board's intent to collect the debt by offset;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An opportunity to inspect and copy Board records pertaining to  the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An opportunity to request reconsideration of the debt by the  Board, or if provided for by statute, waiver of the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Board  to repay or pay the debt, as the case may be;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An explanation of the debtor's rights under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An opportunity for a hearing when required under the provisions  of 4 CFR 102.3(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Board learns that other agencies of the Government are  holding funds payable to the debtor, the Board shall provide the other  agencies with written certification that the debt is owed to the Board  and that the Board has complied with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3. The  Board shall request that funds which are due the debtor and which are  necessary to offset the debt to the Board be transferred to the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board may accept a repayment or payment agreement, as  appropriate, in lieu of offset, but will do so only after balancing the  Government's interest in collecting the debts against fairness to the  debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its  existence or amount, the Board may accept a repayment or payment  agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish  under sworn affidavit or statement certified under penalty of perjury  that offset would result in financial hardship or would result in undue  financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative offset is not authorized with respect to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Debts owed by any State or local government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Debts once they become subject to the salary offset provisions  of 5 U.S.C. 5514; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by  administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by  another statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Board reserves the right to take any other action in respect  to offset as is permitted under 4 CFR 102.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Board shall make appropriate use of the cooperative efforts  of other agencies including the Army Holdup List in effecting  collections by offset. The Army Holdup List is a list of contractors  indebted to the United States.</p>
