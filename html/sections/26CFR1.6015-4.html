                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requesting spouse who files a joint return for which a  liability remains unpaid and who does not qualify for full relief under  Sec. 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 may request equitable relief under this  section. The Internal Revenue Service has the discretion to grant  equitable relief from joint and several liability to a requesting spouse  when, considering all of the facts and circumstances, it would be  inequitable to hold the requesting spouse jointly and severally liable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section may not be used to circumvent the limitation of  Sec. 1.6015-3(c)(1) (i.e., no refunds under Sec. 1.6015-3). Therefore,  relief is not available under this section to obtain a refund of  liabilities already paid, for which the requesting spouse would  otherwise qualify for relief under Sec. 1.6015-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For guidance concerning the criteria to be used in determining  whether it is inequitable to hold a requesting spouse jointly and  severally liable under this section, see Rev. Proc. 2000-15 (2000-1 C.B.  447), or other guidance published by the Treasury and IRS (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).  [T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]</p>
