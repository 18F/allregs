The petition copy will be  time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is filed with  the court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Chief Counsel to the IG receives two or more petitions  within 10 days after the DAB issues its decision, the Chief Counsel to  the IG will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation  of any petitions that were received within the 10-day period.
