                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)</em>. For taxable years commencing  after December 31, 1960, the full amount of any increase in tax due to  the operation of section 802(b)(3) shall be imposed without any further  transitional reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em> that is attributable to other subtractions  from the policyholders surplus account by reason of the operation of the  special rules contained in section 815(d). However, the transitional  rule provided by section 802(a)(3) does apply in the case of a  distribution to which section 815(e)(1)(B) (ii) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 802(a)(3)  and this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For the taxable year 1960, X, a life insurance company, had  taxable investment income of $9,000, gain from operations of $27,000,  and subtractions from the policyholders surplus account of $22,000.  Based upon these figures, X had life insurance company taxable income of  $40,000 for 1960, of which $18,000 was includible under section 802(b)  (1) and (2) and $22,000 under section 802(b)(3). Applying the tax  imposed by section 802(a)(1) (at rates as in effect for 1960), without  regard to the transitional rule of section 802(a)(3), X would have a tax  liability of $15,300 ($40,000 multiplied by 52 percent, less $5,500).  However, applying the transitional rule of section 802(a)(3), the actual  tax liability of X, for 1960, would be $12,000, computed as follows:  (1) Total tax liability (without regard to sec. 802(a)(3))...    $15,300 (2) Life insurance company taxable income.........    $40,000 (3) Amount subtracted from policyholders surplus       22,000</p><p class="depth0">account..........................................
