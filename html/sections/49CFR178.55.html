                                Sec. 178.55  Specification 4B240ET welded or brazed cylinders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Type, spinning process, size and service pressure. A DOT 4B240ET  cylinder is a brazed type cylinder made from electric resistance welded  tubing. The maximum water capacity of this cylinder is 12 pounds or 333  cubic inches and the service must be 240 psig. The maximum outside  diameter of the shell must be five inches and maximum length of the  shell is 21 inches. Cylinders closed in by a spinning process are  authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Steel. Open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform  quality must be used. Plain carbon steel content may not exceed the  following: Carbon, 0.25; phosphorus, 0.045; sulfur, 0.050. The addition  of other elements for alloying effect is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification of material. Material must be identified by any  suitable method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and  processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the  requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to  weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and  uniform surface finish is required. Heads may be attached to shells by  lap brazing or may be formed integrally. The thickness of the bottom of  cylinders welded or formed by spinning is, under no condition, to be  less than two times the minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell.  Such bottom thicknesses must be measured within an area bounded by a  line representing the points of contact between the cylinder and the  floor when the cylinder is in a vertical position. Seams must conform to  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circumferential seams must be by brazing only. Heads must be  attached to shells by the lap brazing method and must overlap not less  than four times the wall thickness. Brazing material must have a melting  point of not less than 1000 F. Heads must have a driving fit with the  shell unless the shell is crimped, swedged, or curled over the skirt or  flange of the head and be thoroughly brazed until complete penetration  of the joint by the brazing material is secured. Brazed joints may be  repaired by brazing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Longitudinal seams in shell must be by electric resistance  welded joints only. No repairs to longitudinal joints is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance  with CGA C-3 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Welding or brazing. Only the attachment, by welding or brazing,  to the tops and bottoms of cylinders of neckrings, footrings, handles,  bosses, pads, and valve protection rings is authorized. Provided that  such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are  attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not  exceed 0.25 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Wall thickness. The wall stress must be at least two times the  service pressure and may not exceed 18,000 psi. The minimum wall  thickness is 0.044 inch. Calculation must be made by the following  formula:  S = [P(1.3D\2\ + 0.4d\2\)] / (D\2\ - d\2\)  Where:  S = wall stress in psig; P = 2 times service pressure; D = outside diameter in inches; d = inside diameter in inches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Heat treatment. Heads formed by drawing or pressing must be  uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests. Cylinders with  integral formed heads or bases must be subjected to a normalizing  operation. Normalizing and brazing operations may be combined, provided  the operation is carried out at a temperature in excess of the upper  critical temperature of the steel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Openings in cylinders. Openings in cylinders must comply with  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each opening in cylinders, except those for safety devices, must  be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to the  cylinder by brazing or by welding or by threads. A fitting, boss, or pad  must be of steel suitable for the method of attachment employed, and  which need not be identified or verified as to analysis, except that if  attachment is by welding, carbon content may not exceed 0.25 percent. If  threads are used, they must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Threads must be clean cut, even without checks, and tapped to  gauge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for  American Standard taper pipe threads.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have  tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test  pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent  leakage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a  hydrostatic test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method,  operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit  reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit  reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1  cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and  sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure  applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not  exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test  apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be  repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is  the lower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of  total volumetric expansion at test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cylinders must be tested as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(3)</em> of this section to at least two times service pressure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All cylinders not tested as outlined in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of  this section must be examined under pressure of at least two times  service pressure and show no defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each 1000 cylinders or less successively produced each day must  constitute a lot. One cylinder must be selected from each lot and  hydrostatically tested to destruction. If this cylinder bursts below  five times the service pressure, then two additional cylinders must be  selected and subjected to this test. If either of these cylinders fails  by bursting below five times the service pressure then the entire lot  must be rejected. All cylinders   constituting a lot must be of identical size, construction heat- treatment, finish, and quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Flattening test. Following the hydrostatic test, one cylinder  taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, must be subjected to a  flattening test that is between knife edges, wedge shaped, 60 angle,  rounded to \1/2\ inch radius.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine  yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of  material, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder, or part  thereof heat-treated as required, taken at random out of each lot of 200  or less in the case of cylinders of capacity greater than 86 cubic  inches and out of each lot of 500 or less for cylinders having a  capacity of 86 cubic inches or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specimens must conform to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1\1/2\ inches,  a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 1\1/2\ inches, or a  gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6  times the thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over \3/ 16\ inch thick.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened.  Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight  specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and  may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows.  When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must  show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in  regard to such specimens.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding  to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The yield strength must be determined by either the ``offset''  method or the ``extension under load'' method as prescribed in ASTM E 8  (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In using the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain  (or ``extension under load'') corresponding to the stress at which the  0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient  accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under  appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length.  Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of  30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain  diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2  percent offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must  be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain  indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed \1/8\  inch per minute during yield strength determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Acceptable results for physical and flattening tests. Acceptable  results for the physical and flattening tests are an elongation of at  least 40 percent for a 2 inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in  other cases and a yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile  strength. In this instance the flattening test is required, without  cracking, to six times the wall thickness with a weld 90 from the  direction of the applied load. Two rings cut from the ends of length of  pipe used in production of a lot may be used for the flattening test  provided the rings accompany the lot which they represent in all thermal  processing operations. At least one of the rings must pass the  flattening test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be  tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been  cleaned and is free from all moisture, subject to the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than service  pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an  area of at least \1/16\ of the total area of the bottom but not less  than \3/4\ inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least 1   minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to  pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications  of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section,  cylinders which are leaking must be rejected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished  cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the  bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this  test before the hydrostatic test, he should design his apparatus so that  the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the  point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air  or gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Rejected cylinders. Repairs of rejected cylinders is authorized.  Cylinders that are leaking must be rejected, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (m) of  this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling  to remove defective material, tapping, and plugging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Brazed joints may be rebrazed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsequent to the operations noted in paragraphs (n)(1) and  (n)(2) of this section, acceptable cylinders must pass all prescribed  tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Marking. Markings on each cylinder must be by stamping plainly  and permanently on shoulder, top head, neck or valve protection collar  which is permanently attached to the cylinders and forming an integral  part thereof, provided that cylinders not less than 0.090 inch thick may  be stamped on the side wall adjacent to top head.
