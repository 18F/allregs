                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Negotiated settlements in lieu of performance of actual restoration work by the Government are ordinarily favored because they most satisfactorily achieve the objectives of fulfilling the Government's obligations under the lease in the most efficient and economical manner, recouping the greatest amount of the Government's investment in improvements to leased property and maintaining good public relations in the acquisition and disposal of leaseholds. However, because of variable circumstances, this principle cannot be stated as an inflexible rule applicable to every case. It is the responsibility of the DE to carefully consider all possible approaches within

the scope of this chapter and select the best course of procedure in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Financial limitations which preclude actual restoration. In view of the limitations of the Government's restoration obligations to amounts not in excess of the fee value of the leased property, or the difference in values of the leased property with and without restoration, actual performance of restoration work is precluded where these amounts would be exceeded, and a settlement in lieu of restoration is in order in amounts not to exceed the limitations indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Settlement where property enhanced in value by improvements. Where the leased property has been enhanced in value by the Government's improvements, no restoration should be performed nor payment by the Government made in lieu thereof. Instead, effort should first be made to obtain from the lessor a cash payment to the Government equal to the in place value of the improvements, together with a full release of the Government from any restoration obligations. If the lessor is not willing to pay the in place value, but will offer a lesser amount in excess of the estimated net salvage value, settlement may be reached on that basis. If the lessor will not agree to make payment of any amount, or will offer only an amount which is less than the net salvage value of the improvements, consideration should be given to selling the improvements for removal and accomplishing any remaining restoration by payment in lieu thereof or by actual performance of the work. If it becomes necessary or advisable to arrange for separate sale of any or all of the improvements, the sale should be accomplished in accordance with Sec. Sec. 644.540 through 644.557. The terms of sale in such case will require the removal of the improvements on or before the expiration or termination of the lease and contains any other special requirements applicable to the particular case, including site restoration. Bids received should be compared with the highest price offered by the lessor, due consideration being given to the cost of restoration, if any, which would remain after removal of the improvements. It must always be borne in mind that the disposition of public property to private parties must be at prices which can be shown to be in the best interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reaching agreement on estimates of cost. The terminal survey and condition reports specify the items to be restored and the lessor's estimate of cost. Those items reflected on the ENG Form 1440-R (part 3) afford comparison between the lessor's and the Government's estimates. Where there is a variance in the estimates and the lessor's total estimate is lower, effort will be made to settle on the basis of his estimate. If the lessor's overall estimate is higher than the Government's, effort will be made to reach agreement on acceptance of the Government's total estimate. If the lessor's estimate is substantially higher on specific items, it may be desirable to disclose the basis on which the Government's estimate is predicated in order to demonstrate its reasonableness. The Government's estimate of cost for items of restoration may be made available to the lessor upon request. When the lessor requests items of work not shown on the Government's estimate, careful consideration will be given to his request, further inspection of the premises made, when necessary, and a determination made as to whether the Government is obligated under the lease to perform the work. If no liability is determined to exist, the lessor will be fully informed as to the reasons for noninclusion in the estimate. If liability is determined to exist, the estimate will be adjusted accordingly. In any case where the existence or extent of the legal obligation of the Government to restore is questionable, the DE will submit the facts, in writing, to DAEN-REM together with his recommendation. No lease restoration settlement will be allowed to become involved in litigation or formal claims procedure without the matter having been submitted to DAEN-REM for review. When a satisfactory cash settlement by the Government cannot be negotiated, the DE is authorized to perform the actual restoration work.</p>
