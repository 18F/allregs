For purposes of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An ordinary annuity interest is the right to receive a fixed  dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives  or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor  for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth of the  right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest  rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an  annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at  the beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in any  computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An ordinary income interest is the right to receive the income  from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for  some other defined period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an  ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the right to  receive the use of $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate  prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. However, in the  case of certain gifts made after October 8, 1990, if the donor does not  retain a qualified annuity, unitrust, or reversionary interest, the  value of any interest retained by the donor is considered to be zero if  the remainder beneficiary is a member of the donor's family. See Sec.  25.2702-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An ordinary remainder or reversionary interest is the right to  receive an interest in property at the end of one or more measuring  lives or some   other defined period. A standard section 7520 remainder factor for an  ordinary remainder or reversionary interest represents the present worth  of the right to receive $1.00 at the end of a defined period, using the  interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain restricted beneficial interests. A restricted  beneficial interest is an annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary  interest that is subject to any contingency, power, or other  restriction, whether the restriction is provided for by the terms of the  trust, will, or other governing instrument or is caused by other  circumstances. In general, a standard section 7520 annuity, income, or  remainder factor may not be used to value a restricted beneficial  interest. However, a special section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder  factor may be used to value a restricted beneficial interest under some  circumstances. See paragraphs (b)(2)(v) Example 5 and (b)(4) of this  section, which illustrate situations in which special section 7520  actuarial factors are needed to take into account limitations on  beneficial interests. See Sec. 25.7520-1(c) for requesting a special  factor from the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other beneficial interests. If, under the provisions of this  paragraph (b), the interest rate and mortality components prescribed  under section 7520 are not applicable in determining the value of any  annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest, the actual fair  market value of the interest (determined without regard to section 7520)  is based on all of the facts and circumstances if and to the extent  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code provision applicable to the  property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provisions of governing instrument and other limitations on  source of payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annuities. A standard section 7520 annuity factor  may not be used to determine the present value of an annuity for a  specified term of years or the life of one or more individuals unless  the effect of the trust, will, or other governing instrument is to  ensure that the annuity will be paid for the entire defined period. In  the case of an annuity payable from a trust or other limited fund, the  annuity is not considered payable for the entire defined period if,  considering the applicable section 7520 interest rate on the valuation  date of the transfer, the annuity is expected to exhaust the fund before  the last possible annuity payment is made in full. For this purpose, it  must be assumed that it is possible for each measuring life to survive  until age 110. For example, for a fixed annuity payable annually at the  end of each year, if the amount of the annuity payment (expressed as a  percentage of the initial corpus) is less than or equal to the  applicable section 7520 interest rate at the date of the transfer, the  corpus is assumed to be sufficient to make all payments. If the  percentage exceeds the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the  annuity is for a definite term of years, multiply the annual annuity  amount by the Table B term certain annuity factor, as described in Sec.  25.7520-1(c)(1), for the number of years of the defined period. If the  percentage exceeds the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the  annuity is payable for the life of one or more individuals, multiply the  annual annuity amount by the Table B annuity factor for 110 years minus  the age of the youngest individual. If the result exceeds the limited  fund, the annuity may exhaust the fund, and it will be necessary to  calculate a special section 7520 annuity factor that takes into account  the exhaustion of the trust or fund. This computation would be modified,  if appropriate, to take into account annuities with different payment  terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income and similar interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Beneficial enjoyment. A  standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest is  not to be used to determine the present value of an income or similar  interest in trust for a term of years or for the life of one or more  individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other governing  instrument is to provide the income beneficiary with that degree of  beneficial enjoyment of the property during the term of the income  interest that the principles of the law of trusts accord to a person who  is unqualifiedly designated as the income beneficiary of a trust for a  similar period of time. This   degree of beneficial enjoyment is provided only if it was the  transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the governing  instrument and the surrounding circumstances, that the trust provide an  income interest for the income beneficiary during the specified period  of time that is consistent with the value of the trust corpus and with  its preservation. In determining whether a trust arrangement evidences  that intention, the treatment required or permitted with respect to  individual items must be considered in relation to the entire system  provided for in the administration of the subject trust. Similarly, in  determining the present value of the right to use tangible property  (whether or not in trust) for one or more measuring lives or for some  other specified period of time, the interest rate component prescribed  under section 7520 and Sec. 1.7520-1 of this chapter may not be used  unless, during the specified period, the effect of the trust, will or  other governing instrument is to provide the beneficiary with that  degree of use, possession, and enjoyment of the property during the term  of interest that applicable state law accords to a person who is  unqualifiedly designated as a life tenant or term holder for a similar  period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Diversions of income and corpus. A standard section 7520 income  factor for an ordinary income interest may not be used to value an  income interest or similar interest in property for a term of years, or  for one or more measuring lives, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The trust, will, or other governing instrument requires or  permits the beneficiary's income or other enjoyment to be withheld,  diverted, or accumulated for another person's benefit without the  consent of the income beneficiary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The governing instrument requires or permits trust corpus to be  withdrawn from the trust for another person's benefit without the  consent of the income beneficiary during the income beneficiary's term  of enjoyment and without accountability to the income beneficiary for  such diversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Remainder and reversionary interests. A standard section 7520  remainder interest factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary  interest may not be used to determine the present value of a remainder  or reversionary interest (whether in trust or otherwise) unless,  consistent with the preservation and protection that the law of trusts  would provide for a person who is unqualifiedly designated as the  remainder beneficiary of a trust for a similar duration, the effect of  the administrative and dispositive provisions for the interest or  interests that precede the remainder or reversionary interest is to  assure that the property will be adequately preserved and protected  (e.g., from erosion, invasion, depletion, or damage) until the remainder  or reversionary interest takes effect in possession and enjoyment. This  degree of preservation and protection is provided only if it was the  transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the arrangement  and the surrounding circumstances, that the entire disposition provide  the remainder or reversionary beneficiary with an undiminished interest  in the property transferred at the time of the termination of the prior  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pooled income fund interests. In general, pooled income funds  are created and administered to achieve a special rate of return. A  beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is not ordinarily valued  using a standard section 7520 income or remainder interest factor. The  present value of a beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is  determined according to rules and special remainder factors prescribed  in Sec. 1.642(c)-6 of this chapter and, when applicable, the rules set  forth under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the individual who is  the measuring life is terminally ill at the time of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Unproductive property. The donor transfers corporation  stock to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is  payable to A for life. Considering the applicable federal rate under  section 7520 and the appropriate life estate factor for a person A's  age, the value of A's income interest, if valued under this section,  would be $10,000. After A's death, the trust is to terminate and the  trust property is to be distributed to B. The trust specifically  authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain the shares   of stock. The corporation has paid no dividends on this stock during the  past 5 years, and there is no indication that this policy will change in  the near future. Under applicable state law, the corporation is  considered to be a sound investment that satisfies fiduciary standards.  The facts and circumstances, including applicable state law, indicate  that the income beneficiary would not have the legal right to compel the  trustee to make the trust corpus productive in conformity with the  requirements for a lifetime trust income interest under applicable local  law. Therefore, the life income interest in this case is considered  nonproductive. Consequently, A's income interest may not be valued  actuarially under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Beneficiary's right to make trust productive. The facts  are the same as in Example 1, except that the trustee is not  specifically authorized to retain the shares of corporation stock.  Further, the terms of the trust specifically provide that the life  income beneficiary may require the trustee to make the trust corpus  productive consistent with income yield standards for trusts under  applicable state law. Under that law, the minimum rate of income that a  productive trust may produce is substantially below the section 7520  interest rate on the valuation date. In this case, because A, the income  beneficiary, has the right to compel the trustee to make the trust  productive for purposes of applicable local law during A's lifetime, the  income interest is considered an ordinary income interest for purposes  of this paragraph, and the standard section 7520 life income factor may  be used to determine the value of A's income interest. However, in the  case of gifts made after October 8, 1990, if the donor was the life  income beneficiary, the value of the income interest would be considered  to be zero in this situation. See Sec. 25.2702-2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Annuity trust funded with unproductive property. The  donor, who is age 60, transfers corporation stock worth $1,000,000 to a  trust. The trust will pay a 6 percent ($60,000 per year) annuity in cash  or other property to the donor for 10 years or until the donor's prior  death. Upon the termination of the trust, the trust property is to be  distributed to the donor's child. The section 7520 rate for the month of  the transfer is 8.2 percent. The corporation has paid no dividends on  the stock during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this  policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state law, the  corporation is considered to be a sound investment that satisfies  fiduciary standards. Therefore, the trust's sole investment in this  corporation is not expected to adversely affect the interest of either  the annuity beneficiary or the remainder beneficiary. Considering the 6  percent annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section 7520 interest  rate, the trust corpus is considered sufficient to pay this annuity for  the entire 10-year term of the trust, or even indefinitely. The trust  specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain the  shares of stock. Although it appears that neither beneficiary would be  able to compel the trustee to make the trust corpus produce investment  income, the annuity interest in this case is considered to be an  ordinary annuity interest, and a section 7520 annuity factor may be used  to determine the present value of the annuity. In this case, the section  7520 annuity factor would represent the right to receive $1.00 per year  for a term of 10 years or the prior death of a person age 60.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Unitrust funded with unproductive property. The facts are  the same as in Example 3, except that the donor has retained a unitrust  interest equal to 7 percent of the value of the trust property, valued  as of the beginning of each year. Although the trust corpus is  nonincome-producing, the present value of the donor's retained unitrust  interest may be determined by using the section 7520 unitrust factor for  a term of years or a prior death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The donor, who is  age 60 and in normal health, transfers property worth $1,000,000 to a  trust on or after May 1, 2009, but before 2019. The trust will pay a 10  percent ($100,000 per year) annuity to a charitable organization for the  life of the donor, payable annually at the end of each period, and the  remainder then will be distributed to the donor's child. The section  7520 rate for the month of the transfer is 6.8 percent. First, it is  necessary to determine whether the annuity may exhaust the corpus before  all annuity payments are made. Because it is assumed that any measuring  life may survive until age 110, any life annuity could require payments  until the measuring life reaches age 110. Based on a section 7520  interest rate of 6.8 percent, the determination of whether the annuity  may exhaust the corpus before the termination of the annuity interest is  made as follows:  Age to which life annuity may continue................               110 less: Age of measuring life at date of transfer.......                60</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0">Number of years annuity may continue..............                50 Annual annuity payment................................       $100,000.00 times: Annuity factor for 50 years....................</p><p class="depth0">derived from Table B..............................</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1-.037277/.068)</em>..................................           14.1577 Present value of term certain annuity.................     $1,415,770.00</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the present value of an annuity for a term of 50 years  exceeds the corpus, the annuity may exhaust the trust before all  payments are made. Consequently, the annuity must be valued as an  annuity payable for a term of years or until the prior death of the  annuitant, with the term of years determined by when the fund will be  exhausted by the annuity payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The annuity factor for a term of years at 6.8 percent is  derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor in Table B (see  Sec. 20.2031-7(d)(6)) from 1.000000 and then dividing the result by  .068. An annuity of $100,000 payable at the end of each year for a  period that has an annuity factor of 10.0 would have a present value  exactly equal to the principal available to pay the annuity over the  term. The annuity factor for 17 years is 9.8999 and the annuity factor  for 18 years is 10.2059. Thus, it is determined that the $1,000,000  initial transfer will be sufficient to make 17 annual payments of  $100,000, but not to make the entire 18th payment. The present value of  an annuity of $100,000 payable at the end of each year for 17 years is  $100,000 times 9.8999 or $989,990. The remaining amount is $10,010.00.  Of the initial corpus amount, $10,010.00 is not needed to make payments  for 17 years, so this amount, as accumulated for 18 years, will be  available for the final payment. The 18-year accumulation factor is (1 +  0.068)\18\ or 3.268004, so the amount available in 18 years is  $10,010.00 times 3.268004 or $32,712.72. Therefore, for purposes of  analysis, the annuity payments are considered to be composed of two  distinct annuity components. The two annuity components taken together  must equal the total annual amount of $100,000. The first annuity  component is the exact amount that the trust will have available for the  final payment, $32,712.72. The second annuity component then must be  $100,000 minus $32,712.72, or $67,287.28. Specifically, the initial  corpus will be able to make payments of $67,287.28 per year for 17 years  plus payments of $32,712.72 per year for 18 years. The total annuity is  valued by adding the value of the two separate annuity components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Based on Table H of Publication 1457, Actuarial Valuations  Version 3A, which may be obtained from the IRS Internet site, the  present value of an annuity of $67,287.28 per year payable for 17 years  or until the prior death of a person aged 60 is $597,013.12 ($67,287.28  x 8.8726). The present value of an annuity of $32,712.72 per year  payable for 18 years or until the prior death of a person aged 60 is  $296,887.56 ($32,712.72 x 9.0756). Thus, the present value of the  charitable annuity interest is $893,900.68 ($597,013.12 + $296,887.56).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>,  an individual who is known to have an incurable illness or other  deteriorating physical condition is considered terminally ill if there  is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within  1 year. However, if the individual survives for eighteen months or  longer after the date the gift is completed, that individual shall be  presumed to have not been terminally ill at the date the gift was  completed unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing  evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Terminal illness. The donor transfers property worth  $1,000,000 to a child on or after May 1, 2009 but before 2019, in  exchange for the child's promise to pay the donor $80,000 per year for  the donor's life, payable annually at the end of each period. The donor  is age 75 but has been diagnosed with an incurable illness and has at  least a 50 percent probability of dying within 1 year. The section 7520  interest rate for the month of the transfer is 7.6 percent, and the  standard annuity factor at that interest rate for a person age 75 in  normal health is 6.6493 (1--.49465/.076). Thus, if the donor were not  terminally ill, the present value of the annuity would be $531,944.00  ($80,000 x 6.6493). Assuming the presumption provided in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section does not apply, because there is at least a 50  percent probability that the donor will die within 1 year, the standard  section 7520 annuity factor may not be used to determine the present  value of the donor's annuity interest. Instead, a special section 7520  annuity factor must be computed that takes into account the projection  of the donor's actual life expectancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional limitations. Section 7520 does not apply to the  extent as may   otherwise be provided by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability dates. Section 25.7520-3(a) is effective  as of May 1, 1989. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section,  except Example 5 in paragraph (b)(2)(v) and paragraph (b)(4), are  effective with respect to gifts made after December 13, 1995.
