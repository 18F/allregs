                                Sec. 1.6654-1  Addition to the tax in the case of an individual.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 6654 imposes an addition to the taxes  under chapters 1 and 2 of the Code in the case of any underpayment of  estimated tax by an individual (with certain exceptions described in  section 6654(d)), including any underpayment of estimated qualified  State individual income taxes which are treated pursuant to section  6361(a) as if they were imposed by chapter 1. This addition to the tax  is in addition to any applicable criminal penalties and is imposed  whether or not there was reasonable cause for the underpayment. The  amount of the underpayment for any installment date is the excess of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following percentages of the tax shown on the return for the  taxable year or, if no return was filed, of the tax for such year,  divided by the number of installment dates prescribed for such taxable  year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 80 percent in the case of taxable years beginning after December  31, 1966, of individuals not referred to in section 6073(b) (relating to  income from farming or fishing);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 70 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January  1, 1967, of such individuals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 66\2/3\ percent in the case of individuals referred to in  section 6073(b); over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the  last day prescribed for such payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the addition is determinated at the annual rate  referred to in the regulations under section 6621 upon the underpayment  of any installment of estimated tax for the period from the date such  installment is required to be paid until the 15th day of the fourth  month following the close of the taxable year, or the date such  underpayment is paid, whichever is earlier. For purposes of determining  the period of the underpayment (i) the date prescribed for the payment  of any installment of estimated tax shall be determined without regard  to any extension of time, and (ii) a payment of estimated tax on any  installment date, to the extent that it exceeds the amount of the  installment determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for  such installment date, shall be considered a payment of any previous  underpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In determining the amount of the installment paid on or before  the last day prescribed for payment thereof, the estimated tax shall be  computed without any reduction for the amount which the taxpayer  estimates as his credit under section 31 (relating to tax withheld at  source on wages), and the amount of such credit shall be deemed a  payment of estimated tax. An equal part of the amount of such credit  shall be deemed paid on each installment date (determined under section  6153) for the taxable year unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on  which all amounts were actually withheld. In the latter case, all  amounts withheld shall be considered as payments of estimated tax on the  dates such amounts were actually withheld. Under section 31 the entire  amount withheld during a calendar year is allowed as a credit against  the tax for the taxable year which begins in such calendar year.  However, where more than one taxable year begins in any calendar year no  portion of the amount withheld during the calendar year will be treated  as a payment of estimated tax for any taxable year other than the last  taxable year beginning in such calendar year. The rules prescribed in  this subparagraph for determining the time as of   which the amount withheld shall be deemed paid are applicable even  though such amount was withheld during a taxable year preceding that for  which the credit is allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term tax when used in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph  shall mean:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (other than by section  56 or, for taxable years ending before September 30, 1968, the tax  surcharge imposed by section 51), including any qualified State  individual income taxes which are treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as  if they were imposed by chapter 1, plus--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the tax  imposed by chapter 2 of the Code, minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All credits allowed by part IV, subchapter A of chapter 1,  except the credit provided by section 31, relating to tax withheld at  source on wages, minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of an individual who is subject to one or more  qualified State individual incomes taxes, the sum of the credits allowed  against such taxes pursuant to section 6362(b)(2) (B) or (C) or section  6362(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6362-4 of this chapter  (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (relating to the credit  for income taxes of other States or political subdivisions thereof) and  paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 301.6361-1 (relating to the credit for tax  withheld from wages on account of qualified State individual income  taxes), and minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For taxable years ending after February 29, 1980, the  individual's overpayment of windfall profit tax imposed by section 4986  of the Code for the taxable year. For this purpose, the amount of such  overpayment is the sum of (A) the amount by which such individual's  aggregate windfall profit tax liability for the taxable year as a  producer of crude oil is exceeded by withholding of windfall profit tax  for the taxable year, and (B) any amount treated under section 6429 or  6430 as an overpayment of windfall profit tax for crude oil removed  during the taxable year. The deemed payment date in section  4995(a)(4)(B) for the amount of windfall profit tax withheld with  respect to payments for crude oil shall have no effect in the  determination of the overpayment of windfall profit tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Statement relating to underpayment. If there has been an  underpayment of estimated tax as of any installment date prescribed for  its payment and the taxpayer believes that one or more of the exceptions  described in Sec. 1.6654-2 precludes the assertion of the addition to  the tax under section 6654, he should attach to his income tax return  for the taxable year a Form 2210 showing the applicability of any  exception upon which he relies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section  for computing the addition to the tax may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An individual taxpayer files his return for the calendar  year 1972 on April 15, 1973, showing a tax (income and self-employment  tax) of $30,000. He had paid a total of $20,000 of estimated tax in four  installments of $5,000 on each of the four installment dates prescribed  for such year. No other payments were made prior to the date the return  was filed. Since the amount of each installment paid by the last date  prescribed for payment thereof is less than one-quarter of 80 percent of  the tax shown on the return, the addition to the tax is applicable in  respect of the underpayment existing as of each installment date and is  computed as follows:  (1) Amount of tax shown on return.......................         $30,000 (2) 80 percent of item (1)..............................          24,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------- (3) One-fourth of item (2)..............................           6,000 (4) Deduct amount paid on each installment date.........           5,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------- (5) Amount of underpayment for each installment date               1,000</p><p class="depth0">(item (3) minus item (4))..............................</p><p class="depth0">=============== (6) Addition to the tax:</p><p class="depth0">1st installment--period 4-15-72 to 4-15-73............              60</p><p class="depth0">2nd installment--period 6-15-72 to 4-15-73............              50</p><p class="depth0">3rd installment--period 9-15-72 to 4-15-73............              35</p><p class="depth0">4th installment--period 1-15-73 to 4-15-73............              15</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">Total...............................................            $160</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An individual taxpayer files his return for the calendar  year 1955 on April 15, 1956, showing a tax of $30,000. The requirements  of section 6015(a) were first met after April 1 and before June 2, 1955,  and a total of $18,000 of estimated tax was paid in three equal  installments of $6,000 on each of the three installment dates prescribed  for such year. Since the amount of each installment paid by the last  date prescribed for payment   thereof is less than one-third of 70 percent of the tax shown on the  return, the addition to the tax is existing as of each installment date  and is applicable in respect of the underpayment computed as follows:  (1) Amount of tax shown on return..........................      $30,000 (2) 70 percent of item (1).................................       21,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (3) One-third of item (2)..................................        7,000 (4) Deduct amount paid on each installment date............        6,000</p><p class="depth0">========== (5) Amount of underpayment for each installment date (item         1,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> minus item (4))....................................... (6) Addition to the tax:</p><p class="depth0">1st installment--period 6-15-55 to 4-15-56......      $50</p><p class="depth0">2d installment--period 9-15-55 to 4-15-56.......       35</p><p class="depth0">3d installment--period 1-15-56 to 4-15-56.......       15</p><p class="depth0">Total.......................................      100</p><p class="depth0">(Secs. 6015, 6154, 6654, 6655, and 7805, Internal Revenue Code of 1954  (96 Stat. 2395 and 2396, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 6015, 6154, 6654,  6655, and 7805))  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12146, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7384, 40 FR  49322, Oct. 22, 1975; T.D. 7427, 41 FR 34029, Aug. 12, 1976; T.D. 7577,  43 FR 59358, Dec. 20, 1978; T.D. 8016, 50 FR 11855, Mar. 26, 1985]</p>
