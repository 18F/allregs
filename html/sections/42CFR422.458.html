                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Terminology. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2">Allowable costs means, with respect to an MA regional plan offered by an organization for a year, the total amount of costs that the organization incurred in providing benefits covered under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option for all enrollees under the plan in the region in the year and in providing rebatable integrated benefits, as defined in this paragraph, reduced by the portion of those costs attributable to administrative expenses incurred in providing these benefits.</p><p class="depth2">Rebatable integrated benefits means those non-drug supplemental benefits that are funded through beneficiary rebates (described at Sec. 422.266(b)(1)) and that CMS determines are additional health benefits not covered under the original Medicare program option and that require expenditures by the plan. For purposes of the calculation of risk corridors, these are the only supplemental benefits that count toward allowable costs.</p><p class="depth2">Target amount means, with respect to an MA regional plan offered by an organization in a year, the total amount of payments made to the organization for enrollees in the plan for the year (which includes payments attributable to benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option as defined in Sec. 422.100(c)(1), the total of the MA monthly basic beneficiary premium collectible for those enrollees for the year, and the total amount of rebatable integrated benefits), reduced by the amount of administrative expenses assumed in the portion of the bid attributable to benefits under original Medicare fee-for-service program option or to rebatable integrated benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of risk corridors for benefits covered under original fee-for-service Medicare--(1) General rule. This section will only apply to MA regional plans offered during 2006 or 2007.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. This section will only apply to MA regional plans offered during 2006 or 2007.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification of allowable costs under the plan. In the case of an MA organization that offers an MA regional plan in an MA region in 2006 or 2007, the organization must notify CMS, before that date in the succeeding year as CMS specifies, of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its total amount of costs that the organization incurred in providing benefits covered under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option for all enrollees under the plan (as described in paragraph (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its total amount of costs that the organization incurred in providing rebatable integrated benefits for all enrollees under the plan (as described in paragraph (a) of this section), and, with respect to those benefits, the portion of those costs that is attributable to administrative expenses that is in addition to the administrative expense incurred in provision of benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment of payment--(1) No adjustment if allowable costs within 3 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are at least 97 percent, but do not exceed 103 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, there will be no payment adjustment under this section for the plan and year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No adjustment if allowable costs within 3 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are at least 97 percent, but do not exceed 103 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, there will be no payment adjustment under this section for the plan and year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increase in payment if allowable costs above 103 percent of target amount--(i) Costs between 103 and 108 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are greater than 103 percent, but not greater than 108 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, CMS will increase the total of the monthly payments made to the organization offering the plan for the year under Sec. 422.302(a) (section 1853(a) of the Act) by an amount equal to 50 percent of the difference between those allowable costs and 103 percent of that target amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Costs between 103 and 108 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are greater than 103 percent, but not greater than 108 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, CMS will increase the total of the monthly payments made to the organization offering the plan for the year under Sec. 422.302(a) (section 1853(a) of the Act) by an amount equal to 50 percent of the difference between those allowable costs and 103 percent of that target amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Costs above 108 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are greater than 108 percent of the target amount for the plan and year, CMS will increase the total of the monthly payments made to the organization offering the plan for the year under section 1853(a) of the Act by an amount equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 2.5 percent of that target amount; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 80 percent of the difference between those allowable costs and 108 percent of that target amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reduction in payment if allowable costs below 97 percent of target amount--(i) Costs between 92 and 97 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are less than 97 percent, but greater than or equal to 92 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, CMS will reduce the total of the monthly payments made to the organization offering the plan for the year under Sec. 422.302(a) (section 1853(a) of the Act) by an amount (or otherwise recover from the plan an amount) equal to 50 percent of the difference between 97 percent of the target amount and those allowable costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Costs between 92 and 97 percent of target amount. If the allowable costs for the plan for the year are less than 97 percent, but greater than or equal to 92 percent, of the target amount for the plan and year, CMS will reduce the total of the monthly payments made to the organization offering the plan for the year under Sec. 422.302(a) (section 1853(a) of the Act) by an amount (or otherwise recover from the plan an amount) equal to 50 percent of the difference between 97 percent of the target amount and those allowable costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Costs below 92 percent of target amount.

Each MA organization offering an MA regional plan must provide CMS with information as CMS determines is necessary to implement this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Each MA organization offering an MA regional plan must provide CMS with information as CMS determines is necessary to implement this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> According to Sec. 422.504(d)(1)(iii), CMS has the right to inspect and audit any books and records of the organization that pertain to the information regarding costs provided to CMS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restriction on use of information. Information disclosed or obtained for the purposes of this section may be used by officers, employees, and contractors of DHHS only for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary in, implementing this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Organizational and financial requirements--(1) General rule. Regional MA plans offered by MA organizations must be licensed under State law, or otherwise authorized under State law, as a risk-bearing entity (as defined in Sec. 422.2) eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers one or more plans. However, as provided for under this section, MA organizations offering MA regional plans may obtain a temporary waiver of State licensure. In the case of an MA organization that is offering an MA regional plan in an MA region, and is not licensed in each State in which it offers such an MA regional plan, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.
