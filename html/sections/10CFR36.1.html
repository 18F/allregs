                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part contains requirements for the issuance of a license  authorizing the use of sealed sources containing radioactive materials  in irradiators used to irradiate objects or materials using gamma  radiation. This part also contains radiation safety requirements for  operating irradiators. The requirements of this part are in   addition to other requirements of this chapter. In particular, the  provisions of parts 19, 20, 21, 30, 37, 71, 170, and 171 of this chapter  apply to applications and licenses subject to this part. Nothing in this  part relieves the licensee from complying with other applicable Federal,  State and local regulations governing the siting, zoning, land use, and  building code requirements for industrial facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations in this part apply to panoramic irradiators that  have either dry or wet storage of the radioactive sealed sources and to  underwater irradiators in which both the source and the product being  irradiated are under water. Irradiators whose dose rates exceed 5 grays  (500 rads) per hour at 1 meter from the radioactive sealed sources in  air or in water, as applicable for the irradiator type, are covered by  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The regulations in this part do not apply to self-contained dry- source-storage irradiators (those in which both the source and the area  subject to irradiation are contained within a device and are not  accessible by personnel), medical radiology or teletherapy, radiography  (the irradiation of materials for nondestructive testing purposes),  gauging, or open-field (agricultural) irradiations.
