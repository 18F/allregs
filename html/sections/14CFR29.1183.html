Components must be shielded or located so as to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid. An integral oil sump of less than 25-quart capacity on a reciprocating engine need not be fireproof nor be enclosed by a fireproof shield.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lines, fittings, and components which are already approved as part of a type certificated engine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vent and drain lines, and their fittings, whose failure will not result in or add to, a fire hazard.
