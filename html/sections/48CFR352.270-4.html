                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As prescribed in 370.303(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Notice to Offerors of Requirements of 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of</p><p class="depth0">Human Subjects (January 2006)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Copies of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR Part 46, are available from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by HHS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR Part 46.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) are exempt from coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal. The Government's Project Officer will make a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, the Project Officer will consult with OHRP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In accordance with 45 CFR Part 46, offerors being considered for award shall file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall ensure that: the rights and welfare of the human subjects involved are adequately protected; the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to both the potential benefits, if any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained; and informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate and appropriate. HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR Part 46), information regarding OHRP registration and assurance requirements/processes, and OHRP contact information can be accessed at the OHRP Web site (at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Offerors may consult with OHRP for advice or guidance concerning either regulatory requirements or ethical issues pertaining to research involving human subjects.</p><p class="depth0">(End of provision)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As prescribed in 370.304(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Protection of Human Subjects (January 2006)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor agrees that the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research under this contract shall be protected in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46 and with the Contractor's current Assurance of Compliance on file with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Department of Health and Human Services. The Contractor further agrees to provide certification at least annually that the Institutional Review Board has reviewed and approved the procedures, which involve human subjects in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46 and the Assurance of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for the performance of all work and services involving the use of human subjects under this contract and shall ensure that work is conducted in a proper manner and as safely as is feasible. The parties hereto agree that the Contractor retains the right to control and direct the performance of all work under this contract. The Contractor shall not deem anything in this contract to constitute the Contractor or any subcontractor, agent or employee of the Contractor, or any other person, organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever, as the agent or employee of the Government. The Contractor agrees that it has entered into this contract and will discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the Contractor or its employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with OHRP that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements and/or standards stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payments under this contract until the Contractor corrects the noncompliance. The Contracting Officer may communicate the notice of suspension by telephone with confirmation in writing. If the Contractor fails to complete corrective action within the period of time designated in the Contracting Officer's written notice of suspension, the Contracting Officer may, after consultation with OHRP, terminate this contract in whole or in part, and the Contractor's name may be removed from the list of those contractors with approved Human Subject Assurances.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p>
