If so, applicant must furnish to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls the information specified in Sec. 130.10.

Any such political contributions are deemed for purposes of this

part to be political contributions by the applicant, supplier or vendor who paid or offered or agreed to pay the fee or commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any applicant or supplier which has informed the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls under this section that neither it nor its vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in an aggregate amount requiring the information specified in Sec. 130.10 to be furnished, must subsequently furnish such information within 30 days after learning that it or its vendors had paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in respect of a sale in an aggregate amount which, if known to applicant or supplier at the time of its previous communication with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, would have required the furnishing of information under Sec. 130.10 at that time. Any report furnished under this paragraph must, in addition to the information specified in Sec. 130.10, include a detailed statement of the reasons why applicant or supplier did not furnish the information at the time specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable.
