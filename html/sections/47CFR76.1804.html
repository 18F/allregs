                            <p class="depth0">An MVPD shall notify the Commission before transmitting any carrier or other signal component with an average power level across a 25 kHz bandwidth in any 160 microsecond time period equal to or greater than 10-4 watts at any point in the cable distribution system on any new frequency or frequencies in the aeronautical radio frequency bands (108-137 and 225-400 MHz). The notification shall be made on FCC Form 321. Such notification shall include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Legal name and local address of the MVPD;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The names and FCC identifiers (e.g., CA0001) of the system communities affected, for a cable system, and the name and FCC identifier (e.g., CAB901), for other MVPDs;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The names and telephone numbers of local system officials who are responsible for compliance with Sec. Sec.  76.610 through 76.616 and Sec.  76.1803;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carrier frequency, tolerance, and type of modulation of all carriers in the aeronautical bands at any location in the cable distribution system and the maximum of those average powers measured over a 2.5 kHz bandwidth as described in the introductory paragraph to this rule section;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The geographical coordinates (in NAD83) of a point near the center of the system, together with the distance (in kilometers) from the designated point to the most remote point of the plant, existing or planned, that defines a circle enclosing the entire plant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification that the monitoring procedure used is in compliance with Sec.  76.614 or description of the routine monitoring procedure to be used; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For MVPDs subject to Sec.  76.611, the cumulative signal leakage index derived under Sec.  76.611(a)(1) or the results of airspace measurements derived under Sec.  76.611(a)(2), including a description of the method by which compliance with the basic signal leakage criteria is achieved and the method of calibrating the measurement equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Aeronautical Frequency Notifications, FCC Form 321, shall be personally signed either electronically or manually by the operator; by one of the partners, if the operator is a partnership; by an officer, if the operator is a corporation; by a member who is an officer, if the operator is an unincorporated association; or by any duly authorized employee of the operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Aeronautical Frequency Notifications, FCC Form 321, may be signed by the operator's attorney in case of the operator's physical disability or of his absence from the United States.
