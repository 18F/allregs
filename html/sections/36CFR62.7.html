                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of need for modifications. After designation, the  modification of the boundaries of a natural landmark, and/or revision of  information about it, may be appropriate. For example, because of new  information or changes in the condition of an NNL, the boundary may have  to be reduced or expanded or information about the NNL may have to be  revised. Additional study may reveal that the area has nationally  significant values that had not been previously documented. The NPS  determines that landmark modifications are necessary through  administration of the program. In addition, the NPS may receive  suggestions for landmark modifications from other Federal agencies,  State natural area programs, and other public and private organizations  or individuals. The NPS determines the validity of these suggestions by  applying the natural landmark criteria or by conducting additional  study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Boundary expansion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Three justifications exist for enlarging  the boundary of a national natural landmark: better documentation of the  extent of nationally significant features, professional error in the  original designation, or additional landowners with nationally  significant features on their property desiring the designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the NPS determines that an expansion of the boundary of the  national natural landmark is appropriate, it   will use the designation process outlined in Sec. 62.4(b) through (j).  If a boundary is expanded, only the owners in the newly considered but  as yet not designated portion of the area are notified and asked if they  object to designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary reduction. Two justifications exist for reducing the  boundary of a national natural landmark: Loss of integrity of the  natural features or professional error in the original designation. If  the NPS determines that a reduction in the national natural landmark  boundary is indicated, the designation removal process outlined in Sec.  62.8 is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change in description of values. If the NPS determines that a  change in the description of the national natural landmark's nationally  significant values is warranted, the NPS prepares the recommended  changes and the Director submits the changes and all supportive  documentation to the National Park System Advisory Board. The Advisory  Board reviews the information submitted by the Director and makes  recommendations to the Secretary. The Secretary reviews the supportive  documentation and the recommendations of the board, and may approve  changes in the description of a landmark's nationally significant  values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>. Based upon owner response to this notification, the NPS  determines whether the proposed change is a minor technical correction  to landmark documentation that can be made administratively or whether  the procedures outlined in Sec. 62.4(d) through (j) must be followed.</p>
