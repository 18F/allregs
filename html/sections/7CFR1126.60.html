Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the  combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in this section  shall result from the steps   set forth in Sec. 1000.44(a), (b), and (c), respectively, and the  nonfat components of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the  proportion of such components in producer skim milk. Receipts of  nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted  milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of  another Federal order under Sec. 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded  from pricing under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class I value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk in Class I by the Class I skim  milk price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in  Class I by the Class I butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class II value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by  the Class II nonfat solids price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in  Class II times the Class II butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class III value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the pounds of protein in Class III skim milk by the  protein price;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of other solids  in Class III skim milk by the other solids price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in  Class III by the butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Class IV value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the pounds of nonfat solids in Class IV skim milk by  the nonfat solids price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of butterfat in  Class IV by the butterfat price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compute an adjustment for the somatic cell content of producer  milk by multiplying the values reported pursuant to Sec. 1126.30(a)(1)  and (c)(1) by the percentage of total producer milk allocated to Class  II, Class III, and Class IV pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(c);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned  to each class pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(11) and the corresponding  step of Sec. 1000.44(b) by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices  applicable to each class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiply the difference between the current month's Class I, II,  or III price, as the case may be, and the Class IV price for the  preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat  subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to Sec.  1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at  the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the  hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to  Sec. 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat  subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi)  and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of  bulk fluid cream products from plants regulated under other Federal  orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants,  plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply  plants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b) and the  pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to  Sec. 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b),  excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk  products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an  equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by  handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and  priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other  payment obligation under any order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk  products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the  Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class  IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in  receipts of nonfluid   milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec.  1000.43(d).
