                            <p class="depth0">If you operate a veneer redryer, you must record the inlet moisture content of the veneer processed in the redryer according to Sec. 63.2269(a) and (c) and Sec. 63.2270 for a minimum of 30 calendar days. You must designate and clearly identify each veneer redryer. You must submit the highest recorded 24-hour average inlet veneer moisture content with your Notification of Compliance Status to show that your veneer redryer processes veneer with an inlet moisture content of less than or equal to 25 percent (by weight, dry basis). In addition, submit with the Notification of Compliance Status a signed statement by a responsible official that certifies with truth, accuracy, and completeness that the veneer redryer will dry veneer with a moisture content less than 25 percent (by weight, dry basis) in the future.</p>
