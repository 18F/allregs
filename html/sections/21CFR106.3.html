The term ``manufacturer'' does not include a person who prepares, reconstitutes, or mixes infant formula exclusively for an infant under his/her direct care or the direct care of the institution employing such person.</p><p class="depth0">Microorganisms means yeasts, molds, bacteria, and viruses and includes, but is not limited to, species having public health significance.</p><p class="depth0">New infant formula means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An infant formula manufactured by a person that has not previously manufactured an infant formula, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An infant formula manufactured by a person that has previously manufactured infant formula and in which there is a major change in processing or formulation from a current or any previous formulation produced by such manufacturer, or which has not previously been the subject of a submission under section 412(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the U.S. market.</p><p class="depth2">Nutrient means any vitamin, mineral, or other substance or ingredient that is required in accordance with the ``Nutrients'' table set out in section 412(i)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or by regulations issued under section 412(i)(2) or that is identified as essential for infants by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine through its development of a Dietary Reference Intake, or that has been identified as essential for infants by the Food and Drug Administration through a Federal Register publication.</p><p class="depth2">Nutrient premix means a combination of ingredients containing two or more
