                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preparation of TTB Form 5630.5t. Every manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, and export warehouse proprietor is required to pay special (occupational) tax and file a return on TTB Form 5630.5t, ``Special Tax Registration and Return--Tobacco.'' TTB Form 5630.5t must be completed in accordance with the instructions on the form, and all of the information called for on the form must be provided, including the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to special (occupational) tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employer identification number (see Sec. 46.102).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exact location of the place of business, by name and number of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some specific description in addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two or more locations, the address to be shown must be the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ownership and control information. This consists of the name, position, and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person having power to control its management and policies with respect to the activity subject to special tax. ``Owner of the business'' includes every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 10 percent or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the

ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be stated if the same information has been previously provided to TTB in connection with a permit application and that previously provided information is still current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiple locations and/or classes of tax. A taxpayer subject to special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more than one class of tax must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> File one special tax return, TTB Form 5630.5t, with payment of tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's name, address (as shown on TTB Form 5630.5t), employer identification number, and period covered by the return. The list must show, by State, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which special tax is being paid. The original of the list must be filed with TTB as an attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t, and the copy must be retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for a period of three years from the date of the return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Signing of TTB Form 5630.5t--(1) By principal. The return of an individual proprietor must be signed by the individual. The return of a partnership must be signed by a general partner. The return of a corporation must be signed by an officer. In each case, the person signing the return must designate his or her capacity as ``individual owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a corporation, the officer's title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By principal. The return of an individual proprietor must be signed by the individual. The return of a partnership must be signed by a general partner. The return of a corporation must be signed by an officer. In each case, the person signing the return must designate his or her capacity as ``individual owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a corporation, the officer's title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By fiduciary. A receiver, trustee, assignee, executor, administrator, or other legal representative who continues the business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased, or otherwise incapacitated person must indicate the capacity in which the fiduciary acts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or attorney in fact, the signature must be preceded by the name of the principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is filed, with the TTB office with which the return is required to be filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Perjury statement. Each TTB Form 5630.5t must contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that the return has been executed under the penalties of perjury.
