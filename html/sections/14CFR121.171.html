                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating  limitations for all certificate holders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this part, effective length of the runway for  landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction  clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway  intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this subpart, obstruction clearance plane  means a plane sloping upward from the runway   at a slope of 1:20 to the horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all  obstructions within a specified area surrounding the runway as shown in  a profile view of that area. In the plan view, the centerline of the  specified area coincides with the centerline of the runway, beginning at  the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the  centerline of the runway and proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet  from the beginning point. Thereafter the centerline coincides with the  takeoff path over the ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or  with the instrument approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the  applicable one of these paths has not been established, it proceeds  consistent with turns of at least 4,000 foot radius until a point is  reached beyond which the obstruction clearance plane clears all  obstructions. This area extends laterally 200 feet on each side of the  centerline at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects  the runway and continues at this width to the end of the runway; then it  increases uniformly to 500 feet on each side of the centerline at a  point 1,500 feet from the intersection of the obstruction clearance  plane with the runway; thereafter it extends laterally 500 feet on each  side of the centerline.
