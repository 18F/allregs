Costs incurred for improvements which add to  the permanent value of the buildings and equipment or appreciably  prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see  Sec. 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures). These costs are  only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other  agreements.</p>
