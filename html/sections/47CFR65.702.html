                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured separately for  each access service category for purposes of determining compliance with  the maximum allowable rate of return. The access service categories  shall be: an aggregated category consisting of Special Access, Sec.  69.113, and Contribution Charges for Special Access Expanded  Interconnection, Sec. 69.122; Connection Charges for Expanded  Interconnection, Sec. 69.121; Common Line, Sec. Sec. 69.104-69.105;  and an aggregated category consisting of Line Termination, Sec. 69.106,  Intercept, Sec. 69.108, Local Switching, Sec. 69.107, Transport,  Sec. Sec. 69.110-69.112, 69.124, 69.125, and Information, Sec. 69.109.  The Billing and Collection access element shall not be included in any  access service category for purposes of this part. The Commission will  also separately review exchange carrier overall interstate earnings  subject to this part for determining compliance with the maximum  allowable rate of return determined by Sec. 65.700(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured for purposes  of determining compliance with the maximum allowable rates of return  separately for each study area; provided, however, that if the carrier  has filed or concurred in access tariffs aggregating costs and rates for  two or more study areas, the earnings will be determined for the  aggregated study areas rather than for each study area separately. If an  exchange carrier has not utilized the same level of study area  aggregation during the entire two-year earnings review period, then the  carrier's earnings will be measured for the entire two-year period on  the basis of the tariffs in effect at the end of the second year of the  two-year review period; provided, however, that if tariffs representing  a higher level of study area aggregation were not in effect for at least  eight months in the second year, then the carrier's earnings will be  measured on the basis of the study area level of aggregation in effect  for the majority of the two-year period; provided further, that any  carrier that was not a member of the National Exchange Carrier  Association or other voluntary pools for both years of the two-year  review period will have its earnings reviewed individually for the full  two-year period.
