Class A observations are  those in which the sensitivity of the equipment is not a primary factor.  Class B observations are those of such a nature that they can be made  only with advanced low-noise receivers using the best techniques.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The name and mailing address of the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The permanent discontinuance of observations, or any change to  the information above, should also be filed with the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Observations being conducted on frequencies or frequency bands  not allocated to the radio astronomy service should be reported as in  paragraph (a) of this section for information purposes. Information in  this category will not be submitted for entry in the Master  International Frequency Register and protection from interference will  not be afforded such operations by stations in other services.</p>
