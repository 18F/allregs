Such notice may be filed at any time and shall be effective upon receipt by the Board.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notices filed with the Board shall state which arbitration-program-eligible issue(s) the party is willing to submit to arbitration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notices may, at the submitting party's discretion, provide for a different monetary award cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participants to a proceeding, where one or both parties have not opted into the arbitration program, may by joint notice agree to submit an issue in dispute to the Board's arbitration program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The joint notice must clearly state the issue(s) which the parties are willing to submit to arbitration and the corresponding maximum monetary award cap if the parties desire to arbitrate for a different amount than the Board's $200,000 monetary award cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opt-out procedures. Any party who has elected to participate in the arbitration program may file a notice at any time under Docket No. EP 699, informing the Board of the party's decision to opt out of the program or amend the scope of its participation.
