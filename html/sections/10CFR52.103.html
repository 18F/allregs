                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for hearing under paragraph (a) of this section must  show, prima facie, that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One or more of the acceptance criteria of the ITAAC in the  combined license have not been, or will not be, met; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific operational consequences of nonconformance that  would be contrary to providing reasonable assurance of adequate  protection of the public health and safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission, acting as the presiding officer, shall determine  whether to grant or deny the request for hearing in accordance with the  applicable requirements of 10 CFR 2.309. If the Commission grants the  request, the Commission, acting as the presiding officer, shall  determine whether during a period of interim operation there will be  reasonable assurance of adequate protection to the public health and  safety. The Commission's determination must consider the petitioner's  prima facie showing and any answers thereto. If the Commission  determines there is such reasonable assurance, it shall allow operation  during an interim period under the combined license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission, in its discretion, shall determine appropriate  hearing procedures, whether informal or formal adjudicatory, for any  hearing under paragraph (a) of this section, and shall state its reasons  therefore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commission shall, to the maximum possible extent, render a  decision on issues raised by the hearing   request within 180 days of the publication of the notice provided by  paragraph (a) of this section or by the anticipated date for initial  loading of fuel into the reactor, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A petition to modify the terms and conditions of the combined  license will be processed as a request for action in accordance with 10  CFR 2.206. The petitioner shall file the petition with the Secretary of  the Commission. Before the licensed activity allegedly affected by the  petition (fuel loading, low power testing, etc.) commences, the  Commission shall determine whether any immediate action is required. If  the petition is granted, then an appropriate order will be issued. Fuel  loading and operation under the combined license will not be affected by  the granting of the petition unless the order is made immediately  effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The licensee shall not operate the facility until the Commission  makes a finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license are  met, except for those acceptance criteria that the Commission found were  met under Sec. 52.97(a)(2). If the combined license is for a modular  design, each reactor module may require a separate finding as  construction proceeds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After the Commission has made the finding in paragraph (g) of  this section, the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion in the  combined license, constitute regulatory requirements either for  licensees or for renewal of the license; except for the specific ITAAC  for which the Commission has granted a hearing under paragraph (a) of  this section, all ITAAC expire upon final Commission action in the  proceeding. However, subsequent changes to the facility or procedures  described in the final safety analysis report (as updated) must comply  with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 52.98(e) or (f), as applicable.</p>
