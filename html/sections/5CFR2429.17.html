                            <p class="depth0">After a final decision or order of the Authority has been issued, a  party to the proceeding before the Authority who can establish in its  moving papers extraordinary circumstances for so doing, may move for  reconsideration of such final decision or order. The motion shall be  filed within ten (10) days after service of the Authority's decision or  order. A motion for reconsideration shall state with particularity the  extraordinary circumstances claimed and shall be supported by  appropriate citations. The filing and pendency of a motion under this  provision shall not operate to stay the effectiveness of the action of  the Authority, unless so ordered by the Authority. A motion for  reconsideration need not be filed in order to exhaust administrative  remedies.  [46 FR 40675, Aug. 11, 1981]</p>
