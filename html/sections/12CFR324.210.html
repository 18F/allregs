                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under Sec. 324.209. An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in this subpart, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position in Sec. 324.2, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this Sec. 324.210.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current fair value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the FDIC-supervised institution directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, an FDIC-supervised institution must risk weight the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For debt, equity, or securitization positions, an FDIC-supervised institution may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. An FDIC-supervised institution may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution includes the costs of conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in fair value of the debt or securitization position);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is an exact match between the currency of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in the case where the credit derivative hedge has a standard maturity date:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Debt and securitization positions. (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, an FDIC-supervised institution must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this section, the appropriate specific risk-weighting factors include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sovereign debt positions.

For equity positions that are index contracts comprising a well-diversified portfolio of equity instruments, the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short position is multiplied by a specific risk-weighting factor of 2.0 percent.\29\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\29\ A portfolio is well-diversified if it contains a large number of individual equity positions, with no single position representing a substantial portion of the portfolio's total fair value.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For equity positions arising from the following futures-related arbitrage strategies, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to one side (long or short) of each position with the opposite side exempt from an additional capital requirement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Long and short positions in exactly the same index at different dates or in different market centers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Long and short positions in index contracts at the same date in different, but similar indices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For futures contracts on main indices that are matched by offsetting positions in a basket of stocks comprising the index, an FDIC-supervised

institution may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to the futures and stock basket positions (long and short), provided that such trades are deliberately entered into and separately controlled, and that the basket of stocks is comprised of stocks representing at least 90.0 percent of the capitalization of the index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Due diligence requirements for securitization positions. (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization position that would materially affect the performance of the position by conducting and documenting the analysis set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The FDIC-supervised institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization position and the materiality of the position in relation to capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding for each securitization position by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization position prior to acquiring the position and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring position, considering:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the position, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the position, and deal-specific definitions of default;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For resecuritization positions, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for each securitization position.
