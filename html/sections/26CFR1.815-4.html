                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Every stock life insurance company subject to the  tax imposed by section 802 shall establish and maintain a policyholders  surplus account. This account shall be established as of January 1,  1959, and the beginning or opening balance of the policyholders surplus  account on that date shall be zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additions to policyholders surplus account. The amount added to  the policyholders surplus account for any taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1958, shall be the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An amount equal to 50 percent of the amount by which the gain  from operations for the taxable year exceeds the taxable investment  income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The deduction allowed or allowable under section 809(d)(5) (as  limited by section 809(f)) for certain nonparticipating contracts, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The deduction allowed or allowable under section 809(d)(6) (as  limited by section 809(f)) for taxable years beginning before January 1,  1963, for group life and group accident and health insurance contracts,  and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, for accident  and health insurance and group life insurance contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subtractions from policyholders surplus account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  There shall be subtracted from the cumulative balance in the  policyholders surplus account at the end of any taxable year, computed  without diminution by reason of distributions made during the   taxable year, an amount equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount which (without regard to subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph) is treated under section 815(a) as distributed out of the  policyholders surplus account for the taxable year, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount (determined without regard to section 802(a)(3)) by  which the tax imposed for taxable years beginning before January 1,  1962, by section 802(a)(1), and for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1961, by section 802(a), is increased by reason of section  802(b)(3).  In addition, there shall be subtracted from the policyholders surplus  account for the taxable year those amounts which, at the close of the  taxable year, are subtracted or treated as subtracted from the  policyholders surplus account under section 815(d) (1) and (4) and  paragraphs (a) and (d) of Sec. 1.815-6. For purposes of this paragraph,  the subtractions from the policyholders surplus account shall be treated  as made in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> First the amount determined under section 815(c)(3) by reason of  distributions to shareholders during the taxable year which are treated  as being made out of the policyholders surplus account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Next the amount elected to be subtracted from the policyholders  surplus account for the taxable year under section 815(d)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Then the amount which is treated as a subtraction from the  policyholders surplus account for the taxable year by reason of the  limitation provided in section 815(d)(4); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of computing amount subtracted from policyholders surplus  account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where life insurance company taxable income, computed  without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000. If the life  insurance company taxable income for any taxable year computed under  section 802(b), computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds  $25,000, the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account  shall be determined by multiplying the amount treated as distributed out  of such account by a ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent and  the denominator of which is 100 percent minus the sum of the normal tax  rate and the surtax rate for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where life insurance company taxable income does not exceed  $25,000. If the life insurance company taxable income for any taxable  year, computed under section 802(b), does not exceed $25,000, the amount  subtracted from the policyholders surplus account shall be determined by  multiplying the amount treated as distributed out of such account by a  ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent and the denominator of  which is 100 percent minus the normal tax rate for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where life insurance company taxable income, computed without  regard to section 802(b)(3) does not exceed $25,000, but computed with  regard to section 802(b)(3) does exceed $25,000. If the life insurance  company taxable income for any taxable year, computed without regard to  section 802(b)(3) does not exceed $25,000, but computed with regard to  section 802(b)(3) does exceed $25,000, the amount subtracted from the  policyholders surplus account shall be determined in the following  manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> First, determine the amount by which $25,000 exceeds the amount  determined under section 802(b) (1) and (2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Then, multiply the amount determined under (a) by a ratio, the  numerator of which is 100 percent minus the normal tax rate and the  denominator of which is 100 percent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Next, determine the amount by which the amount treated as  distributed out of the policyholders surplus account exceeds the amount  determined under (b) and multiply such excess by a ratio, the numerator  of which is 100 percent and the denominator of which is 100 percent  minus the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Finally, add the amounts determined under (a) and (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>  and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The life insurance company taxable income of S, a stock  life insurance company, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3),  exceeds $25,000 for the taxable year 1959. Assume that of the amount  distributed by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $9,600 (as  determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section  815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus  account. Since the sum of the normal tax rate (30%) and the surtax rate  (22%) in effect for 1959 is 52 percent. S shall subtract $20,000 from  its policyholders surplus account for the taxable year 1959, computed as  follows:  $9,600x100/(100-52)=$9,600x100/48=$20,000   Of this amount, $9,600 is due to the application of section 815(c)(3)(A)  and $10,400 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that for the taxable year 1960, S, a stock life  insurance company, has taxable investment income of $1,000 and a gain  from operations of $2,000. Assume further that of the amount distributed  by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $3,500 (as determined  under section 815(a) and without regard to section 815(c)(3)(B)) is  treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account. Since  S's life insurance company taxable income does not exceed $25,000 for  the taxable year and the normal tax rate in effect for 1960 is 30  percent, S shall subtract $5,000 from its policyholders surplus account  for the taxable year 1960, computed as follows:  $3,500x100/(100-30)=$3,500x100/70=$5,000   Of this amount, $3,500 is due to the application of section  815(c)(3)(A), and $1,500 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. For the taxable year 1960, the life insurance company  taxable income of S, a stock life insurance company, computed without  regard to section 802(b)(3), is $10,000. Assume that of the amount  distributed by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $12,000  (as determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section  815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus  account. Since the life insurance company taxable income of S, computed  with regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000, in order to determine  the amount to be subtracted from its policyholders surplus account, S  would make up the following schedule:  (1) $25,000 minus life insurance company taxable income,         $15,000</p><p class="depth0">computed without regard to sec. 802(b)(3) ($25,000 minus</p><p class="depth0">$10,000..................................................... (2) Item (1) multiplied by 100 percent minus the normal tax</p><p class="depth0">rate as in effect for 1960, over 100 percent</p><p class="depth0"><em>($15,000x(100-30)/100)</em>...................................     10,500 (3) Amount by which the amount treated as distributed out of</p><p class="depth0">policyholders surplus account ($12,000) exceeds item (2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>($10,500)</em>, multiplied by 100 percent over 100 percent minus</p><p class="depth0">the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate as in</p><p class="depth0">effect for 1960</p><p class="depth0"><em>($1,500x100/(100-52))</em>....................................      3,125 (4) Item (1) plus item (3) ($15,000 plus $3,125).............     18,125</p><p class="depth0">For the taxable year 1960, S shall subtract $18,125 from its  policyholders surplus account. Of this amount, $10,500 represents the  distribution from the policyholders surplus account which is taxed at a  30 percent tax rate and $1,500 the distribution from the policyholders  surplus account which is taxed at a 52 percent tax rate. Thus, of the  amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account for the taxable  year 1960, $12,000 is due to the application of section 815(c)(3) (A),  and $6,125 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustration of principles. The application of section 815(c)  and this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The books of S, a stock life insurance company, reflect the  following items for the taxable year 1960:  Taxable investment income....................................    $25,000 Gain from operations.........................................     30,000 Tax base (sec. 802(b)(1) and (2))............................     27,500 Deduction for certain nonparticipating policies provided by          600</p><p class="depth0">sec. 809(d)(5) (as limited by sec. 809(f)).................. Deduction for group policies provided by sec. 809(d)(6) (as          400</p><p class="depth0">limited by sec. 809(f))..................................... Amount distributed to shareholders...........................     60,000 Cumulative balance in shareholders surplus account as of 12-      36,000</p><p class="depth0">31-60....................................................... Balance in policyholders surplus account as of 1-1-60........     48,000</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from its  policyholders surplus account for the taxable year, S would first make  up the following schedule in order to determine the cumulative balance  in the policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year,  computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the  taxable year:  (1) Balance in policyholders surplus account as of 1-1-60....    $48,000 (2) Additions to account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 50 percent of the amount by which the gain       $2,500</p><p class="depth0">from operations ($30,000) exceeds the taxable</p><p class="depth0">investment income ($25,000) (1/2 x$5,000)......</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The deduction for certain nonparticipating          600</p><p class="depth0">contracts provided by sec. 809(d)(5) (as</p><p class="depth0">limited by sec. 809(f))........................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The deduction for group contracts provided          400</p><p class="depth0">by sec. 809(d)(6) (as limited by sec. 809(f))..</p><p class="depth0">--------      3,500</p><p class="depth0">---------- (3) Cumulative balance in policyholders account as of 12-31-      51,500</p><p class="depth0">60 (item (1) plus item (2)).................................</p><p class="depth0">Under the provisions of section 815(a), since the amount distributed to  shareholders during the taxable year, $60,000, exceeds the cumulative  balance in the shareholders surplus at the end of the taxable year,  computed without diminution by reason of distributions during the  taxable year, $36,000, the shareholders surplus account shall first be  reduced to zero. The remaining $24,000 ($60,000 minus $36,000) of the  distribution shall then be treated as made out of the policyholders  surplus account. Thus, since the tax base under section 802(b)(1) and  (2) is in excess of $25,000, the total amount to be subtracted from the  policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year would be  $50,000 ($24,000x100/(100-52)). Of this amount $26,000 ($50,000 minus  $24,000) represents the tax on the portion of the distribution to  shareholders which is treated as being out of the policyholders surplus  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for 1959 and 1960. For a special transitional rule  applicable to any increase in tax liability under section 802(b)(3) for  the taxable years 1959 and 1960 which is due solely to the operation of  section 815(c)(3) and this section, see section 802(a)(3) and Sec.  1.802-5.
