physical well-being and motor development, and social and emotional development and to individualize the experiences, instructional strategies, and services to best support each child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An agency has been determined during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under Sec. 1307.7:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After December 9, 2011, to have an average score across all classrooms observed below the following minimum thresholds on any of the three CLASS: Pre-K domains from the most recent CLASS: Pre-K observation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the Emotional Support domain the minimum threshold is 4;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the Classroom Organization domain, the minimum threshold is 3;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the Instructional Support domain, the minimum threshold is 2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After December 9, 2011, to have an average score across all classrooms observed that is in the lowest 10 percent on any of the three CLASS: Pre-K domains from the most recent CLASS: Pre-K observation among those currently being reviewed unless the average score across all classrooms observed for that CLASS: Pre-K domain is equal to or above the standard of excellence that demonstrates that the classroom interactions are above an exceptional level of quality. For all three domains, the ``standard of excellence'' is a 6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An agency has had a revocation of its license to operate a Head Start or Early Head Start center or program by a State or local licensing agency during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under Sec. 1307.7 of this part, and the revocation has not been overturned or withdrawn before a competition for funding for the next five-year period is announced. A pending challenge to the license revocation or restoration of the license after correction of the violation shall not affect application of this requirement after the competition for funding for the next five-year period has been announced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An agency has been suspended from the Head Start or Early Head Start program by ACF during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under Sec. 1307.7 of this part and the suspension has not been overturned or withdrawn. If there is a pending appeal and the agency did not have an opportunity to show cause as to why the suspension should not have been imposed or why the suspension should have been lifted if it had already been imposed under 45 CFR part 1303, the agency will not be required to compete based on this condition. If an agency has received an opportunity to show cause, the condition will be implemented regardless of appeal status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An agency has been debarred from receiving Federal or State funds from any Federal or State department or agency or has been disqualified from the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) any time during the relevant time period covered by the responsible HHS official's review under Sec. 1307.7 of this part but has not yet been terminated or denied refunding by ACF.
