                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 904.404(d)(6), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit--Safeguarding Restricted Data and</p><p class="depth0">Other Classified Information (JAN 2004)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee,  fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent  upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this  contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other  classified information (i.e., Formerly Restricted Data and National  Security Information) including compliance with applicable law,  regulation, and DOE directives. The term ``Contractor'' as used in this  clause to address failure to comply shall mean ``Contractor or  Contractor employee.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to other remedies available to the Government, if  the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this  contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other  classified information, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce  the amount of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor  in accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the  Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's  failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the  safeguarding of restricted data or other classified information pursuant  to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction amount. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If in any period (see 48 CFR 952.204-76  (b)(2)) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with  contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted  Data or other classified information, the Contractor's fee or profit of  the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26  percent nor greater than 100 percent of the total fee or profit earned  for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor  greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up  to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. The Contracting  Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction  below the specified range (see 48 CFR 904.402(c)). The mitigating  factors include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the  possibility of the event in advance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contractor self-identification and response to the event to  mitigate impacts and recurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> General status (trend and absolute performance) of safeguarding  Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in  related security areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except in the case of performance-based firm-fixed-price  contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) of this clause), the Contracting  Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract  award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount  of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods  of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of  the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the  expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of  fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the  average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable  during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of  months established above for each period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is  subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs,  in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the  contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not  exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in  the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the  Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative  monetary incentives in the contract for Contractor violations relating  to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information.  Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the  terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of  Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of  performance failures relating to the Contractor's obligations under this  contract for safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified  information are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in  accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have  resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in,  exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are  examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar  import that will be considered first degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE  directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss,  compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or  other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of  information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as  sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons- related data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards  and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result  in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret  Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any  classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as  SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or  unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other  information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of  information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk  nuclear weapons-related data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from  the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret  Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any  classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as  SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second Degree: Performance failures that have been determined,  in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have  actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in,  serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of  performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will  be considered second degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE  directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise,  or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other  information classified as Secret.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards  and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result  in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Sceret Restricted  Data, or other information classified as Secret.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this clause).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from  the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted  Data or other information classified as Secret.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in  accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have  actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in,  undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this  category includes performance failures that result from a lack of  Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper  safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These  performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe  performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected  early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of  performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will  be considered third degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE  directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise,  or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information  classified as Confidential.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of  laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of  Restricted Data or other classified information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to  mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual  risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified  information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security  Plan or other security plan, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contractor actions that result in performance failures which  unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate  indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and  security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data  and other classified information.</p><p class="depth4">(End of clause)  [68 FR 68777, Dec. 10, 2003, as amended at 74 FR 36368, 36370, 36378,  36380, July 22, 2009]</p>
