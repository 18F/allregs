                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, a disclaimer  shall be a qualified disclaimer only if it satisfies the requirements of  this section. In general, to be a qualified disclaimer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The disclaimer must be irrevocable and unqualified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The disclaimer must be in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The writing must be delivered to the person specified in  paragraph (b) (2) of this section within the time limitations specified  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The disclaimant must not have accepted the interest disclaimed  or any of its benefits; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The interest disclaimed must pass either to the spouse of the  decedent or to a person other than the disclaimant without any direction  on the part of the person making the disclaimer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Writing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements. A disclaimer is a qualified  disclaimer only if it is in writing. The writing must identify the  interest in property disclaimed and be signed either by the disclaimant  or by the disclaimant's legal representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delivery. The writing described in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section must be delivered to the transferor of the interest, the  transferor's legal representative, the holder of the legal title to the  property to which the interest relates, or the person in possession of  such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time limit--(1) In general. A disclaimer is a qualified  disclaimer only if the writing described in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this  section is delivered to the persons described in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section no later than the date which is 9 months after the later  of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the transfer creating the interest in the  disclaimant is made, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The day on which the disclaimant attains age 21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (d) of Sec. 301.7502-1 are met. Further,  if the last day of the period specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section falls on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday (as defined in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.7503-1), then the delivery of the writing  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be considered timely  if delivery is made on the first succeeding day which is not Saturday,  Sunday or a legal holiday. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for  rules applicable to the exception for individuals under 21 years of age.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfer. (i) For purposes of the time limitation described in  paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, the 9-month period for making a  disclaimer generally is to be determined with reference to the transfer  creating the interest in the disclaimant. With respect to inter vivos  transfers, a transfer creating an interest occurs when there is a  completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless of whether a  gift tax is imposed on the completed gift. Thus, gifts qualifying for  the gift tax annual exclusion under section 2503(b) are regarded as  transfers creating an interest for this purpose. With respect to  transfers made by a decedent at death or transfers that become  irrevocable at death, the transfer creating the interest occurs on the  date of the decedent's death, even if an estate tax is not imposed on  the transfer. For example, a bequest of foreign-situs property by a  nonresident alien decedent is regarded as a transfer creating an  interest in property even if the transfer would not be subject to estate  tax. If there is a transfer creating an interest in property during the  transferor's lifetime and such interest is later included in the  transferor's gross estate for estate tax purposes (or would have been  included if such interest were subject to estate tax), the 9-month  period for making the qualified disclaimer is determined with reference  to the earlier   transfer creating the interest. In the case of a general power of  appointment, the holder of the power has a 9-month period after the  transfer creating the power in which to disclaim. If a person to whom  any interest in property passes by reason of the exercise, release, or  lapse of a general power desires to make a qualified disclaimer, the  disclaimer must be made within a 9-month period after the exercise,  release, or lapse regardless of whether the exercise, release, or lapse  is subject to estate or gift tax. In the case of a nongeneral power of  appointment, the holder of the power, permissible appointees, or takers  in default of appointment must disclaim within a 9-month period after  the original transfer that created or authorized the creation of the  power. If the transfer is for the life of an income beneficiary with  succeeding interests to other persons, both the life tenant and the  other remaindermen, whether their interests are vested or contingent,  must disclaim no later than 9 months after the original transfer  creating an interest. In the case of a remainder interest in property  which an executor elects to treat as qualified terminable interest  property under section 2056(b)(7), the remainderman must disclaim within  9 months of the transfer creating the interest, rather than 9 months  from the date such interest is subject to tax under section 2044 or  2519. A person who receives an interest in property as the result of a  qualified disclaimer of the interest must disclaim the previously  disclaimed interest no later than 9 months after the date of the  transfer creating the interest in the preceding disclaimant. Thus, if A  were to make a qualified disclaimer of a specific bequest and as a  result of the qualified disclaimer the property passed as part of the  residue, the beneficiary of the residue could make a qualified  disclaimer no later than 9 months after the date of the testator's  death. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the time limitation rule  with reference to recipients who are under 21 years of age.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sentences 1 through 10 and 12 of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section are applicable for transfers creating the interest to be  disclaimed made on or after December 31, 1997.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Joint property--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interests in joint tenancy with right of  survivorship or tenancies by the entirety. Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section (with respect to joint bank,  brokerage, and other investment accounts), in the case of an interest in  a joint tenancy with right of survivorship or a tenancy by the entirety,  a qualified disclaimer of the interest to which the disclaimant succeeds  upon creation of the tenancy must be made no later than 9 months after  the creation of the tenancy regardless of whether such interest can be  unilaterally severed under local law. A qualified disclaimer of the  survivorship interest to which the survivor succeeds by operation of law  upon the death of the first joint tenant to die must be made no later  than 9 months after the death of the first joint tenant to die  regardless of whether such interest can be unilaterally severed under  local law and, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this  section (with respect to certain tenancies created on or after July 14,  1988), such interest is deemed to be a one-half interest in the  property. (See, however, section 2518(b)(2)(B) for a special rule in the  case of disclaimers by persons under age 21.) This is the case  regardless of the portion of the property attributable to consideration  furnished by the disclaimant and regardless of the portion of the  property that is included in the decedent's gross estate under section  2040 and regardless of whether the interest can be unilaterally severed  under local law. See paragraph (c)(5), Examples (7) and (8), of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Certain tenancies in real property between spouses created on  or after July 14, 1988. In the case of a joint tenancy between spouses  or a tenancy by the entirety in real property created on or after July  14, 1988, to which section 2523(i)(3) applies (relating to the creation  of a tenancy where the spouse of the donor is not a United States  citizen), the surviving spouse may disclaim any portion of the joint  interest that is includible in the decedent's gross estate under section  2040. See paragraph (c)(5), Example (9), of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for joint bank, brokerage, and other investment  accounts (e.g., accounts held at mutual funds) established between  spouses or between persons other than husband and wife. In the case of a  transfer to a joint bank, brokerage, or other investment account (e.g.,  an account held at a mutual fund), if a transferor may unilaterally  regain the transferor's own contributions to the account without the  consent of the other cotenant, such that the transfer is not a completed  gift under Sec. 25.2511-1(h)(4), the transfer creating the survivor's  interest in the decedent's share of the account occurs on the death of  the deceased cotenant. Accordingly, if a surviving joint tenant desires  to make a qualified disclaimer with respect to funds contributed by a  deceased cotenant, the disclaimer must be made within 9 months of the  cotenant's death. The surviving joint tenant may not disclaim any  portion of the joint account attributable to consideration furnished by  that surviving joint tenant. See paragraph (c)(5), Examples (12), (13),  and (14), of this section, regarding the treatment of disclaimed  interests under sections 2518, 2033 and 2040.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (c)(4) is applicable for  disclaimers made on or after December 31, 1997.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of  this section may be illustrated by the following examples. For purposes  of the following examples, assume that all beneficiaries are over 21  years of age.</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). On May 13, 1978, in a transfer which constitutes a  completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes, A creates a trust in which  B is given a lifetime interest in the income from the trust. B is also  given a nongeneral testamentary power of appointment over the corpus of  the trust. The power of appointment may be exercised in favor of any of  the issue of A and B. If there are no surviving issue at B's death or if  the power is not exercised, the corpus is to pass to E. On May 13, 1978,  A and B have two surviving children, C and D. If A, B, C or D wishes to  make a qualified disclaimer, the disclaimer must be made no later than 9  months after May 13, 1978.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that B  is given a general power of appointment over the corpus of the trust. B  exercises the general power of appointment in favor of C upon B's death  on June 17, 1989. C may make a qualified disclaimer no later than 9  months after June 17, 1989. If B had died without exercising the general  power of appointment, E could have made a qualified disclaimer no later  than 9 months after June 17, 1989.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). F creates a trust on April 1, 1978, in which F's child  G is to receive the income from the trust for life. Upon G's death, the  corpus of the trust is to pass to G's child H. If either G or H wishes  to make a qualified disclaimer, it must be made no later than 9 months  after April 1, 1978.</p><p class="depth3">Example (4). A creates a trust on February 15, 1978, in which B is  named the income beneficiary for life. The trust further provides that  upon B's death the proceeds of the trust are to pass to C, if then  living. If C predeceases D, the proceeds shall pass to D or D's estate.  To have timely disclaimers for purposes of section 2518, B, C, and D  must disclaim their respective interests no later than 9 months after  February 15, 1978.</p><p class="depth3">Example (5). A, a resident of State Q, dies on January 10, 1979,  devising certain real property to B. The disclaimer laws of State Q  require that a disclaimer be made within a reasonable time after a  transfer. B disclaims the entire interest in real property on November  10, 1979. Although B's disclaimer may be effective under State Q law, it  is not a qualified disclaimer under section 2518 because the disclaimer  was made later than 9 months after the taxable transfer to B.</p><p class="depth3">Example (6). A creates a revocable trust on June 1, 1980, in which B  and C are given the income interest for life. Upon the death of the last  income beneficiary, the remainder interest is to pass to D. The creation  of the trust is not a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes, but  each distribution of trust income to B and C is a completed gift at the  date of distribution. B and C must disclaim each income distribution no  later than 9 months after the date of the particular distribution. In  order to disclaim an income distribution in the form of a check, the  recipient must return the check to the trustee uncashed along with a  written disclaimer. A dies on September 1, 1982, causing the trust to  become irrevocable, and the trust corpus is includible in A's gross  estate for Federal estate tax purposes under section 2038. If B or C  wishes to make a qualified disclaimer of his income interest, he must do  so no later than 9 months after September 1, 1982. If D wishes to make a  qualified disclaimer of his remainder interest, he must do so no later  than 9 months after September 1, 1982.</p><p class="depth3">Example (7). On February 1, 1990, A purchased real property with A's  funds. Title to the property was conveyed to ``A and B, as joint tenants  with right of survivorship.'' Under applicable state law, the joint  interest is unilaterally severable by either tenant. B dies on May 1,  1998, and is survived by A. On   January 1, 1999, A disclaims the one-half survivorship interest in the  property to which A succeeds as a result of B's death. Assuming that the  other requirements of section 2518(b) are satisfied, A has made a  qualified disclaimer of the one-half survivorship interest (but not the  interest retained by A upon the creation of the tenancy, which may not  be disclaimed by A). The result is the same whether or not A and B are  married and regardless of the proportion of consideration furnished by A  and B in purchasing the property.</p><p class="depth3">Example (8). Assume the same facts as in Example (7) except that A  and B are married and title to the property was conveyed to ``A and B,  as tenants by the entirety.'' Under applicable state law, the tenancy  cannot be unilaterally severed by either tenant. Assuming that the other  requirements of section 2518(b) are satisfied, A has made a qualified  disclaimer of the one-half survivorship interest (but not the interest  retained by A upon the creation of the tenancy, which may not be  disclaimed by A). The result is the same regardless of the proportion of  consideration furnished by A and B in purchasing the property.</p><p class="depth3">Example (9). On March 1, 1989, H and W purchase a tract of vacant  land which is conveyed to them as tenants by the entirety. The entire  consideration is paid by H. W is not a United States citizen. H dies on  June 1, 1998. W can disclaim the entire joint interest because this is  the interest includible in H's gross estate under section 2040(a).  Assuming that W's disclaimer is received by the executor of H's estate  no later than 9 months after June 1, 1998, and the other requirements of  section 2518(b) are satisfied, W's disclaimer of the property would be a  qualified disclaimer. The result would be the same if the property was  held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship that was unilaterally  severable under local law.</p><p class="depth3">Example (10). In 1986, spouses A and B purchased a personal  residence taking title as tenants by the entirety. B dies on July 10,  1998. A wishes to disclaim the one-half undivided interest to which A  would succeed by right of survivorship. If A makes the disclaimer, the  property interest would pass under B's will to their child C. C, an  adult, and A resided in the residence at B's death and will continue to  reside there in the future. A continues to own a one-half undivided  interest in the property. Assuming that the other requirements of  section 2518(b) are satisfied, A may make a qualified disclaimer with  respect to the one-half undivided survivorship interest in the residence  if A delivers the written disclaimer to the personal representative of  B's estate by April 10, 1999, since A is not deemed to have accepted the  interest or any of its benefits prior to that time and A's occupancy of  the residence after B's death is consistent with A's retained undivided  ownership interest. The result would be the same if the property was  held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship that was unilaterally  severable under local law.</p><p class="depth3">Example (11). H and W, husband and wife, reside in state X, a  community property state. On April 1, 1978, H and W purchase real  property with community funds. The property is not held by H and W as  jointly owned property with rights of survivorship. H and W hold the  property until January 3, 1985, when H dies. H devises his portion of  the property to W. On March 15, 1985, W disclaims the portion of the  property devised to her by H. Assuming all the other requirements of  section 2518 (b) have been met, W has made a qualified disclaimer of the  interest devised to her by H. However, W could not disclaim the interest  in the property that she acquired on April 1, 1978.</p><p class="depth3">Example (12). On July 1, 1990, A opens a bank account that is held  jointly with B, A's spouse, and transfers $50,000 of A's money to the  account. A and B are United States citizens. A can regain the entire  account without B's consent, such that the transfer is not a completed  gift under Sec. 25.2511-1(h)(4). A dies on August 15, 1998, and B  disclaims the entire amount in the bank account on October 15, 1998.  Assuming that the remaining requirements of section 2518(b) are  satisfied, B made a qualified disclaimer under section 2518(a) because  the disclaimer was made within 9 months after A's death at which time B  had succeeded to full dominion and control over the account. Under state  law, B is treated as predeceasing A with respect to the disclaimed  interest. The disclaimed account balance passes through A's probate  estate and is no longer joint property includible in A's gross estate  under section 2040. The entire account is, instead, includible in A's  gross estate under section 2033. The result would be the same if A and B  were not married.</p><p class="depth3">Example (13). The facts are the same as Example (12), except that B,  rather than A, dies on August 15, 1998. A may not make a qualified  disclaimer with respect to any of the funds in the bank account, because  A furnished the funds for the entire account and A did not relinquish  dominion and control over the funds.</p><p class="depth3">Example (14). The facts are the same as Example (12), except that B  disclaims 40 percent of the funds in the account. Since, under state  law, B is treated as predeceasing A with respect to the disclaimed  interest, the 40 percent portion of the account balance that was  disclaimed passes as part of A's probate estate, and is no longer  characterized as joint property. This 40 percent portion of the account  balance is, therefore, includible in A's gross estate under section  2033. The remaining 60 percent of the account balance that was not  disclaimed retains its character   as joint property and, therefore, is includible in A's gross estate as  provided in section 2040(b). Therefore, 30 percent (\1/2\x60 percent) of  the account balance is includible in A's gross estate under section  2040(b), and a total of 70 percent of the aggregate account balance is  includible in A's gross estate. If A and B were not married, then the 40  percent portion of the account subject to the disclaimer would be  includible in A's gross estate as provided in section 2033 and the 60  percent portion of the account not subject to the disclaimer would be  includible in A's gross estate as provided in section 2040(a), because A  furnished all of the funds with respect to the account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No acceptance of benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acceptance. A qualified  disclaimer cannot be made with respect to an interest in property if the  disclaimant has accepted the interest or any of its benefits, expressly  or impliedly, prior to making the disclaimer. Acceptance is manifested  by an affirmative act which is consistent with ownership of the interest  in property. Acts indicative of acceptance include using the property or  the interest in property; accepting dividends, interest, or rents from  the property; and directing others to act with respect to the property  or interest in property. However, merely taking delivery of an  instrument of title, without more, does not constitute acceptance.  Moreover, a disclaimant is not considered to have accepted property  merely because under applicable local law title to the property vests  immediately in the disclaimant upon the death of a decedent. The  acceptance of one interest in property will not, by itself, constitute  an acceptance of any other separate interests created by the transferor  and held by the disclaimant in the same property. In the case of  residential property, held in joint tenancy by some or all of the  residents, a joint tenant will not be considered to have accepted the  joint interest merely because the tenant resided on the property prior  to disclaiming his interest in the property. The exercise of a power of  appointment to any extent by the donee of the power is an acceptance of  its benefits. In addition, the acceptance of any consideration in return  for making the disclaimer is an acceptance of the benefits of the entire  interest disclaimed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiduciaries. If a beneficiary who disclaims an interest in  property is also a fiduciary, actions taken by such person in the  exercise of fiduciary powers to preserve or maintain the disclaimed  property shall not be treated as an acceptance of such property or any  of its benefits. Under this rule, for example, an executor who is also a  beneficiary may direct the harvesting of a crop or the general  maintenance of a home. A fiduciary, however, cannot retain a wholly  discretionary power to direct the enjoyment of the disclaimed interest.  For example, a fiduciary's disclaimer of a beneficial interest does not  meet the requirements of a qualified disclaimer if the fiduciary  exercised or retains a discretionary power to allocate enjoyment of that  interest among members of a designated class. See paragraph (e) of this  section for rules relating to the effect of directing the redistribution  of disclaimed property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under 21 years of age. A beneficiary who is under 21 years of  age has until 9 months after his twenty-first birthday in which to make  a qualified disclaimer of his interest in property. Any actions taken  with regard to an interest in property by a beneficiary or a custodian  prior to the beneficiary's twenty-first birthday will not be an  acceptance by the beneficiary of the interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (d) (1), (2) and (3) of  this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). On April 9, 1977, A established a trust for the benefit  of B, then age 22. Under the terms of the trust, the current income of  the trust is to be paid quarterly to B. Additionally, one half the  principal is to be distributed to B when B attains the age of 30 years.  The balance of the principal is to be distributed to B when B attains  the age of 40 years. Pursuant to the terms of the trust, B received a  distribution of income on June 30, 1977. On August 1, 1977, B disclaimed  B's right to receive both the income from the trust and the principal of  the trust, B's disclaimer of the income interest is not a qualified  disclaimer for purposes of section 2518(a) because B accepted income  prior to making the disclaimer. B's disclaimer of the principal,  however, does satisfy section 2518(b)(3). See also Sec. 25.2518-3 for  rules relating to the disclaimer of less than an entire interest in  property.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). B is the recipient of certain property devised to B  under the will of A.   The will stated that any disclaimed property was to pass to C. B and C  entered into negotiations in which it was decided that B would disclaim  all interest in the real property that was devised to B. In exchange, C  promised to let B live in the family home for life. B's disclaimer is  not a qualified disclaimer for purposes of section 2518(a) because B  accepted consideration for making the disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). A received a gift of Blackacre on December 25, 1978. A  never resided on Blackacre but when property taxes on Blackacre became  due on July 1, 1979, A paid them out personal funds. On August 15, 1979,  A disclaimed the gift of Blackacre. Assuming all the requirements of  section 2518 (b) have been met, A has made a qualified disclaimer of  Blackacre. Merely paying the property taxes does not constitute an  acceptance of Blackacre even though A's personal funds were used to pay  the taxes.</p><p class="depth3">Example (4). A died on February 15, 1978. Pursuant to A's will, B  received a farm in State Z. B requested the executor to sell the farm  and to give the proceeds to B. The executor then sold the farm pursuant  to B's request. B then disclaimed $50,000 of the proceeds from the sale  of the farm. B's disclaimer is not a qualified disclaimer. By requesting  the executor to sell the farm B accepted the farm even though the  executor may not have been legally obligated to comply with B's request.  See also Sec. 25.2518-3 for rules relating to the disclaimer of less  than an entire interest in property.</p><p class="depth3">Example (5). Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that  instead of requesting the executor to sell the farm, B pledged the farm  as security for a short-term loan which was paid off prior to  distribution of the estate. B then disclaimed his interest in the farm.  B's disclaimer is not a qualified disclaimer. By pledging the farm as  security for the loan, B accepted the farm.</p><p class="depth3">Example (6). A delivered 1,000 shares of stock in Corporation X to B  as a gift on February 1, 1980. A had the shares registered in B's name  on that date. On April 1, 1980, B disclaimed the interest in the 1,000  shares. Prior to making the disclaimer, B did not pledge the shares,  accept any dividends or otherwise commit any acts indicative of  acceptance. Assuming the remaining requirements of section 2518 are  satisfied, B's disclaimer is a qualified disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (7). On January 1, 1980, A created an irrevocable trust in  which B was given a testamentary general power of appointment over the  trust's corpus. B executed a will on June 1, 1980, in which B provided  for the exercise of the power of appointment. On September 1, 1980, B  disclaimed the testamentary power of appointment. Assuming the remaining  requirements of section 2518 (b) are satisfied, B's disclaimer of the  testamentary power of appointment is a qualified disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (8). H and W reside in X, a community property state. On  January 1, 1981, H and W purchase a residence with community funds. They  continue to reside in the house until H dies testate on February 1,  1990. Although H could devise his portion of the residence to any  person, H devised his portion of the residence to W. On September 1,  1990, W disclaims the portion of the residence devised to her pursuant  to H's will but continues to live in the residence. Assuming the  remaining requirements of section 2518(b) are satisfied, W's disclaimer  is a qualified disclaimer under section 2518 (a). W's continued  occupancy of the house prior to making the disclaimer will not by itself  be treated as an acceptance of the benefits of the portion of the  residence devised to her by H.</p><p class="depth3">Example (9). In 1979, D established a trust for the benefit of D's  minor children E and F. Under the terms of the trust, the trustee is  given the power to make discretionary distributions of current income  and corpus to both children. The corpus of the trust is to be  distributed equally between E and F when E becomes 35 years of age.  Prior to attaining the age of 21 years on April 8, 1982, E receives  several distributions of income from the trust. E receives no  distributions of income between April 8, 1982 and August 15, 1982, which  is the date on which E disclaims all interest in the income from the  trust. As a result of the disclaimer the income will be distributed to  F. If the remaining requirements of section 2518 are met, E's disclaimer  is a qualified disclaimer under section 2518(a). To have a qualified  disclaimer of the interest in corpus, E must disclaim the interest no  later than 9 months after April 8, 1982, E's 21st birthday.</p><p class="depth3">Example (10). Assume the same facts as in example (9) except that E  accepted a distribution of income on May 13, 1982. E's disclaimer is not  a qualified disclaimer under section 2518 because by accepting an income  distribution after attaining the age of 21, E accepted benefits from the  income interest.</p><p class="depth3">Example (11). F made a gift of 10 shares of stock to G as custodian  for H under the State X Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. At the time of the  gift, H was 15 years old. At age 18, the local age of majority, the 10  shares were delivered to and registered in the name of H. Between the  receipt of the shares and H's 21st birthday, H received dividends from  the shares. Within 9 months of attaining age 21, H disclaimed the 10  shares. Assuming H did not accept any dividends from the shares after  attaining age 21, the disclaimer by H is a qualified disclaimer under  section 2518.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Passage without direction by the disclaimant of beneficial  enjoyment of disclaimed interest--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A disclaimer is not a  qualified disclaimer   unless the disclaimed interest passes without any direction on the part  of the disclaimant to a person other than the disclaimant (except as  provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). If there is an express or  implied agreement that the disclaimed interest in property is to be  given or bequeathed to a person specified by the disclaimant, the  disclaimant shall be treated as directing the transfer of the property  interest. The requirements of a qualified disclaimer under section 2518  are not satisfied if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The disclaimant, either alone or in conjunction with another,  directs the redistribution or transfer of the property or interest in  property to another person (or has the power to direct the  redistribution or transfer of the property or interest in property to  another person unless such power is limited by an ascertainable  standard); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disclaimed property or interest in property passes to or  for the benefit of the disclaimant as a result of the disclaimer (except  as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section).  If a power of appointment is disclaimed, the requirements of this  paragraph (e)(1) are satisfied so long as there is no direction on the  part of the disclaimant with respect to the transfer of the interest  subject to the power or with respect to the transfer of the power to  another person. A person may make a qualified disclaimer of a beneficial  interest in property even if after such disclaimer the disclaimant has a  fiduciary power to distribute to designated beneficiaries, but only if  the power is subject to an ascertainable standard. See examples (11) and  (12) of paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclaimer by surviving spouse. In the case of a disclaimer made  by a decedent's surviving spouse with respect to property transferred by  the decedent, the disclaimer satisfies the requirements of this  paragraph (e) if the interest passes as a result of the disclaimer  without direction on the part of the surviving spouse either to the  surviving spouse or to another person. If the surviving spouse, however,  retains the right to direct the beneficial enjoyment of the disclaimed  property in a transfer that is not subject to Federal estate and gift  tax (whether as trustee or otherwise), such spouse will be treated as  directing the beneficial enjoyment of the disclaimed property, unless  such power is limited by an ascertainable standard. See examples (4),  (5), and (6) in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partial failure of disclaimer. If a disclaimer made by a person  other than the surviving spouse is not effective to pass completely an  interest in property to a person other than the disclaimant because--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The disclaimant also has a right to receive such property as an  heir at law, residuary beneficiary, or by any other means; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> for the definition of  severable property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effect of precatory language. Precatory language in a disclaimer  naming takers of disclaimed property will not be considered as directing  the redistribution or transfer of the property or interest in property  to such persons if the applicable State law gives the language no legal  effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). A, a resident of State X, died on July 30, 1978.  Pursuant to A's will, B, A's son and heir at law, received the family  home. In addition, B and C each received 50 percent of A's residuary  estate. B disclaimed   the home. A's will made no provision for the distribution of property in  the case of a beneficiary's disclaimer. Therefore, pursuant to the  disclaimer laws of State X, the disclaimed property became part of the  residuary estate. Because B's 50 percent share of the residuary estate  will be increased by 50 percent of the value of the family home, the  disclaimed property will not pass solely to another person.  Consequently, B's disclaimer of the family home is a qualified  disclaimer only with respect to the 50 percent portion that passes  solely to C. Had B also disclaimed B's 50 percent interest in the  residuary estate, the disclaimer would have been a qualified disclaimer  under section 2518 of the entire interest in the home (assuming the  remaining requirements of a qualified disclaimer were satisfied).  Similarly, if under the laws of State X, the disclaimer has the effect  of divesting B of all interest in the home, both as devisee and as a  beneficiary of the residuary estate, including any property resulting  from its sale, the disclaimer would be a qualified disclaimer of B's  entire interest in the home.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). D, a resident of State Y, died testate on June 30,  1978. E, an heir at law of D, received specific bequests of certain  severable personal property from D. E disclaimed the property  transferred by D under the will. The will made no provision for the  distribution of property in the case of a beneficiary's disclaimer. The  disclaimer laws of State Y provide that such property shall pass to the  decedent's heirs at law in the same manner as if the disclaiming  beneficiary had died immediately before the testator's death. Because  State Y's law treats E as predeceasing D, the property disclaimed by E  does not pass to E as an heir at law or otherwise. Consequently, if the  remaining requirements of section 2518(b) are satisfied, E's disclaimer  is a qualified disclaimer under section 2518(a).</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that  State Y has no provision treating the disclaimant as predeceasing the  testator. E's disclaimer satisfies section 2518 (b)(4) only to the  extent that E does not have a right to receive the property as an heir  at law. Had E disclaimed both the share E received under D's will and  E's intestate share, the requirement of section 2518 (b)(4) would have  been satisfied.</p><p class="depth3">Example (4). B died testate on February 13, 1980. B's will  established both a marital trust and a nonmarital trust. The decedent's  surviving spouse, A, is an income beneficiary of the marital trust and  has a testamentary general power of appointment over its assets. A is  also an income beneficiary of the nonmarital trust, but has no power to  appoint or invade the corpus. The provisions of the will specify that  any portion of the marital trust disclaimed is to be added to the  nonmarital trust. A disclaimed 30 percent of the marital trust. (See  Sec. 25.2518-3 (b) for rules relating to the disclaimer of an undivided  portion of an interest in property.) Pursuant to the will, this portion  of the marital trust property was transferred to the nonmarital trust  without any direction on the part of A. This disclaimer by A satisfies  section 2518 (b)(4).</p><p class="depth3">Example (5). Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that A,  the surviving spouse, has both an income interest in the nonmarital  trust and a testamentary nongeneral power to appoint among designated  beneficiaries. This power is not limited by an ascertainable standard.  The requirements of section 2518 (b)(4) are not satisfied unless A also  disclaims the nongeneral power to appoint the portion of the trust  corpus that is attributable to the property that passed to the  nonmarital trust as a result of A's disclaimer. Assuming that the fair  market value of the disclaimed property on the date of the disclaimer is  $250,000 and that the fair market value of the nonmarital trust  (including the disclaimed property) immediately after the disclaimer is  $750,000, A must disclaim the power to appoint one-third of the  nonmarital trust's corpus. The result is the same regardless of whether  the nongeneral power is testamentary or inter vivos.</p><p class="depth3">Example (6). Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that A  has both an income interest in the nonmarital trust and a power to  invade corpus if needed for A's health or maintenance. In addition, an  independent trustee has power to distribute to A any portion of the  corpus which the trustee determines to be desirable for A's happiness.  Assuming the other requirements of section 2518 are satisfied. A may  make a qualified disclaimer of interests in the marital trust without  disclaiming any of A's interests in the nonmarital trust.</p><p class="depth3">Example (7). B died testate on June 1, 1980. B's will created both a  marital trust and a nonmarital trust. The decedent's surviving spouse,  C, is an income beneficiary of the marital trust and has a testamentary  general power of appointment over its assets. C is an income beneficiary  of the nonmarital trust, and additionally has the noncumulative right to  withdraw yearly the greater of $5,000 or 5 percent of the aggregate  value of the principal. The provisions of the will specify that any  portion of the marital trust disclaimed is to be added to the nonmarital  trust. C disclaims 50 percent of the marital trust corpus. Pursuant to  the will, this amount is transferred to the nonmarital trust. Assuming  the remaining requirements of section 2518(b) are satisfied, C's  disclaimer is a qualified disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (8). A, a resident of State X, died on July 19, 1979. A was  survived by a spouse B, and three children, C, D, and E. Pursuant to A's  will, B received one-half of A's estate and the children received equal  shares of the   remaining one-half of the estate. B disclaimed the entire interest B had  received. The will made no provisions for the distribution of property  in the case of a beneficiary's disclaimer. The disclaimer laws of State  X provide that under these circumstances disclaimed property passes to  the decedent's heirs at law in the same manner as if the disclaiming  beneficiary had died immediately before the testator's death. As a  result, C, D, and E are A's only remaining heirs at law, and will divide  the disclaimed property equally among themselves. B's disclaimer  includes language stating that ``it is my intention that C, D, and E  will share equally in the division of this property as a result of my  disclaimer.'' State X considers these to be precatory words and gives  them no legal effect. B's disclaimer meets all other requirements  imposed by State X on disclaimers, and is considered an effective  disclaimer under which the property will vest solely in C, D, and E in  equal shares without any further action required by B. Therefore, B is  not treated as directing the redistribution or transfer of the property.  If the remaining requirements of secton 2518 are met, B's disclaimer is  a qualified disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (9). C died testate on January 1, 1979. According to C's  will, D was to receive \1/3\ of the residuary estate with any disclaimed  property going to E. D was also to receive a second \1/3\ of the  residuary estate with any disclaimed property going to F. Finally, D was  to receive a final \1/3\ of the residuary estate with any disclaimed  property going to G. D specifically states that he is disclaiming the  interest in which the disclaimed property is designated to pass to E. D  has effectively directed that the disclaimed property will pass to E and  therefore D's disclaimer is not a qualified disclaimer under section  2518(a).</p><p class="depth3">Example (10). Assume the same facts as in example (9) except that  C's will also states that D was to receive Blackacre and Whiteacre. C's  will further provides that if D disclaimed Blackacre then such property  was to pass to E and that if D disclaimed Whiteacre then Whiteacre was  to pass to F. D specifically disclaims Blackacre with the intention that  it pass to E. Assuming the other requirements of section 2518 are met, D  has made a qualified disclaimer of Blackacre. Alternatively, D could  disclaim an undivided portion of both Blackacre and Whiteacre. Assuming  the other requirements of section 2518 are met, this would also be a  qualified disclaimer.</p><p class="depth3">Example (11). G creates an irrevocable trust on February 16, 1983,  naming H, I and J as the income beneficiaries for life and F as the  remainderman. F is also named the trustee and as trustee has the  discretionary power to invade the corpus and make discretionary  distributions to H, I or J during their lives. F disclaims the remainder  interest on August 8, 1983, but retains his discretionary power to  invade the corpus. F has not made a qualified disclaimer because F  retains the power to direct enjoyment of the corpus and the retained  fiduciary power is not limited by an ascertainable standard.</p><p class="depth3">Example (12). Assume the same facts as in example (11) except that F  may only invade the corpus to make distributions for the health,  maintenance or support of H, I or J during their lives. If the other  requirements of section 2518(b) are met, F has made a qualified  disclaimer of the remainder interest because the retained fiduciary  power is limited by an ascertainable standard.
