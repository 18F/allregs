The following procedures are to be  followed for making ACP transmitter measurements. For time division  multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under  TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All  measurements must be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna.  Measurement bandwidth used below implies an instrument that measures the  power in many narrow bandwidths (e.g., 300 Hz) and integrates these  powers across a larger band to determine power in the measurement  bandwidth.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Setting reference level. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of  ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For  example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to  6.25 kHz; for a 150 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to  150 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero  and adjust the center frequency of the spectrum analyzer to give the  power level in the measurement bandwidth. Record this power level in dBm  as the ``reference power level''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-swept power measurement. Using a spectrum analyzer capable  of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth as shown in the  tables above. Measure the ACP in dBm. These measurements should be made  at maximum power. Calculate the coupled power by subtracting the  measurements made in this step from the reference power measured in the  previous step. The absolute ACP values must be less than the values  given in the table for each condition above.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Swept power measurement. Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz  resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and sample mode detection.  Sweep MHz from the carrier frequency. Set the  reference level to the RMS value of the transmitter power and note the  absolute power. The response at frequencies greater than 600 kHz must be  less than the values in the tables above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Out-of-band emission limit. On any frequency outside of the  frequency ranges covered by the ACP tables in this section, the power of  any emission must be reduced below the unmodulated carrier power (P) by  at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Authorized bandwidth.
