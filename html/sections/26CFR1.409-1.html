                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 409 authorizes the issuance of bonds under  the Second Liberty Bond Act the purchase price of which would be  deductible under section 219. Section 409 also prescribes the tax  treatment of such bonds. See paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Income tax treatment of bonds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as  provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the entire proceeds upon  redemption of a retirement bond described in section 409(a) shall be  included in the gross income of the taxpayer entitled to such proceeds.  If a bond has not been tendered for redemption by the registered owner  before the close of the taxable year in which he attains age 70\1/2\, he  must include in his gross income for such taxable year the amount of the  proceeds he would have received if the bond had been redeemed at age  70\1/2\. The provisions of sections 72 and 1232 do not apply to a  retirement bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a retirement bond is redeemed within 12  months after the issue date, the proceeds are excluded from gross income  if no deduction is allowed under section 219 on account of the purchase  of such bond. For definition of issue date, see 31 CFR 346.1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a retirement bond is redeemed after the close of the taxable  year in which the registered owner attains age 70\1/2\ the proceeds from  the redemption of the bond are excludable from the gross income of the  registered owner or his beneficiary to the extent that such proceeds  were includible in the gross income of the registered owner for such  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a retirement bond is surrendered for reissuance in the same  or lesser face amount, the difference between current redemption value  of the bond surrendered for reissuance and the current surrender value  of the bond reissued is includible in the gross income of the registered  owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basis. The basis of a retirement bond is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rollover. The first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section  shall not apply in any case in which a retirement bond is redeemed by  the registered owner before the close of the taxable year in which he  attains the age of 70\1/2\ if he transfers the entire amount of the  proceeds of such redemption to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) or  an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) (other than  an endowment contract described in Sec. 1.408-3(e)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section unless no part of  the purchase price of the retirement bond redeemed is attributable to  any source other than a rollover contribution from such an employees'  trust or annuity plan (other than an annuity plan or employees' trust  forming part of a plan under which the individual was an employee within  the meaning of section 401(c)(1) at the time contributions were made on  his behalf under the plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Early redemption. Except as provided in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, under section 409(c) if a retirement  bond is redeemed by the registered owner before he attains age 59\1/2\,  his tax under chapter 1 of the Code is increased by an amount equal to  10 percent of the proceeds of   the redemption includible in his gross income for the taxable year.  Except in the case of the credits allowable under sections 31, 39, or  42, no credit can be used to offset the tax described in the preceding  sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the taxable year of the registered owner in which a  retirement bond is redeemed, the registered owner becomes disabled  within the meaning of section 72(m)(7), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A retirement bond is tendered for redemption in accordance with  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

[T.D. 9321, 72 FR 19276, Apr. 17, 2007]    Sec. 1.409A-1  Definitions and covered plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonqualified deferred compensation plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except  as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), the term nonqualified  deferred compensation plan means any plan (within the meaning of  paragraph (c) of this section) that provides for the deferral of  compensation (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section).  Whether a plan provides for the deferral of compensation generally is  determined at the time the service provider obtains a legally binding  right to the compensation under the plan, and is not affected by any  retroactive change to the plan to characterize the right as one that  does not provide for the deferral of compensation. For example, amounts  deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan do not become  an excluded death benefit if the plan is amended so that the amounts are  payable only upon the death of the service provider. If a principal  purpose of a plan is to achieve a result with respect to a deferral of  compensation that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 409A, the  Commissioner may treat the plan as a nonqualified deferred compensation  plan for purposes of section 409A and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified employer plans. The term nonqualified deferred  compensation plan does not include a qualified employer plan. The term  qualified employer plan means any of the following plans:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any plan described in section 401(a) and a trust exempt from tax  under section 501(a) or that is described in section 402(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any annuity plan described in section 403(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any annuity contract described in section 403(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any simplified employee pension (within the meaning of section  408(k)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any simple retirement account (within the meaning of section  408(p)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any plan under which an active participant makes deductible  contributions to a trust described in section 501(c)(18).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any eligible deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of  section 457(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any plan described in section 415(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any plan described in Sec. 1022(i)(2) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Public Law 93-406 (88 Stat. 829,  942) (Sept. 2, 1974) (ERISA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain foreign plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Participation addressed by treaty.  With respect to an individual for a taxable year, the term nonqualified  deferred compensation plan does not include any scheme, trust,  arrangement, or plan maintained with respect to such individual, to the  extent contributions made by or on behalf of such individual to such  scheme, trust, arrangement, or plan, or credited allocations, accrued  benefits, earnings, or other amounts constituting income, of such  individual under such scheme, trust, arrangement, or plan, are  excludable by such individual for Federal income tax purposes pursuant  to any bilateral income tax convention, or other bilateral or  multilateral agreement, to which the United States is a party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (and not section  7701(b)(1)(A)(i)), or a bona fide resident of a possession (within the  meaning of section 937(a)), the term nonqualified deferred compensation  plan does not include any broad-based foreign retirement plan (within  the meaning of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, an  individual is eligible to participate in a qualified employer plan if  under the terms of the plan and without further amendment or action by  the plan sponsor, the individual is eligible to make or receive  contributions or accrue benefits under the plan (regardless of whether  the individual has elected to participate in the plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Plans subject to a totalization agreement and similar plans.  The term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not include any  social security system of a jurisdiction to the extent that benefits  provided under or contributions made to the system are subject to an  agreement entered into pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security  Act (42 U.S.C. 433) with any foreign jurisdiction. In addition, the term  nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not include a social  security system of   a foreign jurisdiction to the extent that benefits are provided under or  contributions are made to a government-mandated plan as part of that  foreign jurisdiction's social security system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Broad-based foreign retirement plan. The term broad-based  foreign retirement plan means a scheme, trust, arrangement, or plan  (regardless of whether sponsored by a U.S. person) that is written and  that, in the case of an employer-maintained plan, satisfies the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(i))</em>, or bona fide  residents of a possession (within the meaning of section 937(a)),  including rank and file employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plan (alone or in combination with other comparable plans)  actually provides significant benefits for a substantial majority of  such covered employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The benefits actually provided under the plan to such covered  employees are nondiscriminatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The plan contains provisions or is the subject of tax law  provisions or other legal restrictions that generally discourage  employees from using plan benefits for purposes other than retirement or  restrict access to plan benefits before separation from service,  including (but not limited to), restricting in-service distributions  except in events similar to an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in  Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(3)(i)) or hardship (as defined for purposes of section  401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV)), or for educational purposes or the purchase of a  primary residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this section, the inclusion in income of an amount  under section 457(f) is treated as a payment of the amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certain welfare benefits. The term nonqualified deferred  compensation plan does not include a plan, or a portion of a plan, to  the extent that the plan provides bona fide vacation leave, sick leave,  compensatory time, disability pay, or death benefits. For these  purposes, the terms ``disability pay'' and ``death benefits'' have the  same meanings as provided in Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(b)(4)(iv)(C) of this  chapter, provided that for purposes of this paragraph, such disability  pay and death benefits may be provided through insurance and the  lifetime benefits payable under the plan are not treated as including  the value of any taxable term life insurance coverage or taxable  disability insurance coverage provided under the plan. The term  nonqualified deferred compensation plan also does not include any Archer  Medical Savings Account as described in section 220, any Health Savings  Account as described in section 223, or any other medical reimbursement  arrangement, including a health reimbursement arrangement, that  satisfies the requirements of section 105 and section 106 such that the  benefits or reimbursements provided   under such arrangement are not includible in income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deferral of compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(12) of this section, a plan  provides for the deferral of compensation if, under the terms of the  plan and the relevant facts and circumstances, the service provider has  a legally binding right during a taxable year to compensation that,  pursuant to the terms of the plan, is or may be payable to (or on behalf  of) the service provider in a later taxable year. Such compensation is  deferred compensation for purposes of section 409A, this section and  Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6. A legally binding right to an  amount that will be excluded from income when and if received does not  constitute a deferral of compensation, unless the service provider has  received the right in exchange for, or has the right to exchange the  right for, an amount that will be includible in income (other than due  to participation in a cafeteria plan described in section 125). A  service provider does not have a legally binding right to compensation  to the extent that compensation may be reduced unilaterally or  eliminated by the service recipient or other person after the services  creating the right to the compensation have been performed. However, if  the facts and circumstances indicate that the discretion to reduce or  eliminate the compensation is available or exercisable only upon a  condition, or the discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation  lacks substantive significance, a service provider will be considered to  have a legally binding right to the compensation. Whether the discretion  to reduce or eliminate the compensation lacks substantive significance  depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances. However, where the  service provider to whom the compensation may be paid has effective  control of the person retaining the discretion to reduce or eliminate  the compensation, or has effective control over any portion of the  compensation of the person retaining the discretion to reduce or  eliminate the compensation, or is a member of the family (as defined in  section 267(c)(4) applied as if the family of an individual includes the  spouse of any member of the family) of the person retaining the  discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation, the discretion to  reduce or eliminate the compensation will not be treated as having  substantive significance. For this purpose, compensation is not  considered subject to unilateral reduction or elimination merely because  it may be reduced or eliminated by operation of the objective terms of  the plan, such as the application of a nondiscretionary, objective  provision creating a substantial risk of forfeiture. Similarly, a  service provider does not fail to have a legally binding right to  compensation merely because the amount of compensation is determined  under a formula that provides for benefits to be offset by benefits  provided under another plan (including a plan that is qualified under  section 401(a)), or because benefits are reduced due to actual or  notional investment losses, or, in a final average pay plan, subsequent  decreases in compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Earnings. References to the deferral of compensation or deferred  compensation include references to earnings. When the right to earnings  is specified under the terms of the plan, the legally binding right to  earnings arises at the time of the deferral of the compensation to which  the earnings relate. A plan may provide that the time and form of  payment of earnings is treated separately from the time and form of  payment of the underlying compensation, so that, provided that the rules  of section 409A are otherwise met, a plan may provide that earnings will  be paid at a separate time or in a separate form from the payment of the  underlying compensation. For the application of the deferral election  rules to current payments of earnings and dividend equivalents, see  Sec. 1.409A-3(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compensation payable pursuant to the service recipient's  customary payment timing arrangement. A deferral of compensation does  not occur solely because compensation is paid after the last day of the  service provider's taxable year pursuant to the timing arrangement under  which the service recipient normally compensates service providers for  services performed during a payroll period described in section 3401(b),  or   with respect to a non-employee service provider, a period not longer  than the payroll period described in section 3401(b) or if no such  payroll period exists, a period not longer than the earlier of the  normal timing arrangement under which the service provider normally  compensates non-employee service providers or 30 days after the end of  the service provider's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The applicable 2\1/2\ month period is the period ending on the  later of the 15th day of the third month following the end of the  service provider's first taxable year in which the right to the payment  is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or the 15th day  of the third month following the end of the service recipient's first  taxable year in which the right to the payment is no longer subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A payment is treated as actually or constructively received if  the payment is includible in income, including if the payment is  includible in income under section 83, the economic benefit doctrine,  section 402(b), or section 457(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A right to a payment that is never subject to a substantial risk  of forfeiture is considered to be no longer subject to a substantial  risk of forfeiture on the first date the service provider has a legally  binding right to the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A payment is a deferred payment if it is made pursuant to a  provision of a plan that provides for the payment to be made or  completed on or after any date, or upon or after the occurrence of any  event, that will or may occur later than the end of the applicable 2\1/ 2\ month period, such as a separation from service, death, disability,  change in control event, specified time or schedule of payment, or  unforeseeable emergency, regardless of whether an amount is actually  paid as a result of the occurrence of such a payment date or event  during the applicable 2\1/2\ month period. If a plan provides that the  service provider or service recipient may make an election under the  plan (including an election under Sec. 1.409A-2(a)(4)) of a different  payment date, schedule, or event, such right is disregarded for this  purpose. In such cases, whether a plan provides for a deferred payment  is determined based on the payment date, schedule, or event that would  apply if no such election were made, except that if the plan would not  provide for a deferred payment absent such an election, and the service  provider or service recipient makes such an election, whether the plan  provides for a deferred payment is determined based upon the payment  date, schedule, or event that the service provider or service recipient  in fact elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A stock right provides for a deferred payment if such right  includes any provision pursuant to which the holder of the stock right  will or may have the right to exercise the stock right after the  applicable 2\1/2\ month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> This paragraph (b)(4)(i) is applied separately to each payment  (as defined in Sec. 1.409A-2(b)(2)) required to be made under a plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If a plan provides for a deferred payment with respect to part  of a payment (for example a life annuity or a series of installment  amounts treated as a single payment), the plan provides for a deferred  payment with respect to the entire payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, an action or failure to act of the service  provider or a person under the service provider's control, such as a  failure to provide necessary information or documentation, is not an  unforeseeable event. In addition, a payment that otherwise qualifies as  a short-term deferral under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section but is  made after the applicable 2\1/2\ month period may continue to qualify as  a short-term deferral if the taxpayer establishes that the service  recipient reasonably anticipated that the service recipient's deduction  with respect to such payment otherwise would not be permitted by  application of section 162(m), and, as of the date the legally binding  right to the payment arose, a reasonable person would not have  anticipated the application of section 162(m) at the time of the  payment, and provided further that the payment is made as soon as  reasonably practicable following the first date on which the service  recipient anticipates or reasonably should anticipate that, if the  payment were made on such date, the service recipient's deduction with  respect to such payment would no longer be restricted due to the  application of section 162(m). For additional rules applicable to  certain transaction-based compensation, see Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (b)(4). In these examples, except as otherwise noted,  each employee and each employer has a calendar year taxable year and  each employee is an individual who is employed by the specified  employer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On November 1, 2008, Employer Z awards a bonus to  Employee A such that Employee A has a legally binding right to the  payment as of November 1, 2008, that is not subject to a substantial  risk of forfeiture. The bonus plan does not provide for a payment date  or a deferred payment. The bonus plan will not be considered to have  provided for a deferral of compensation if the bonus is paid or made  available to Employee A on or before March 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer Y has a taxable year ending August 31. On  November 1, 2008, Employer Y awards a bonus to Employee B so that  Employee B has a legally binding right to the payment as of November 1,  2008, that is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The bonus  plan does not provide for a payment date or a deferred payment. The  bonus plan will not be considered to have provided for a deferral of  compensation if the bonus is paid or made available to Employee B on or  before November 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On November 1, 2008, Employer X awards a bonus to  Employee C such that Employee C has a legally binding right to the  payment as of November 1, 2008. Under the bonus plan, Employee C will  forfeit the bonus unless Employee C continues performing services  through December 31, 2010. The right to the payment is subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture through December 31, 2010. Employee C has  the right to make a written election not later than December 31, 2009,  to receive the bonus on or after December 31, 2015, but Employee C does  not make such election. The bonus plan does not provide for a default  payment date or a deferred payment in the absence of an election by  Employee C. The bonus plan will not be considered to have provided for a  deferral of compensation if the bonus is paid or made available to  Employee C on or before March 15, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On November 1, 2008, Employer W awards a bonus to  Employee D such that Employee D has a legally binding right to the  payment as of November 1, 2008. Under the bonus plan, the bonus will be  determined based on services performed during the period from January 1,  2009 through December 31, 2010. The bonus is scheduled to be paid as a  lump sum payment on February 15, 2011. Under the bonus plan, Employee D  will forfeit the bonus unless Employee D continues performing services  through the scheduled payment date (February 15, 2011). Provided that at  all times before the scheduled payment date Employee D is required to  continue to perform services to retain the right to the bonus, and the  bonus is paid on or before March 15, 2012, the bonus plan will not be  considered to have provided for a deferral of compensation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On November 1, 2008, Employer V awards a bonus to  Employee E such that Employee E has a legally binding right to the  payment as of November 1, 2008. Under the bonus plan, Employee E will  forfeit the bonus unless Employee E continues performing services  through December 31, 2010. Under the bonus plan, the bonus is scheduled  to be paid as a lump sum payment on July 1, 2011. By specifying a  payment date after the applicable 2\1/2\ month period, the bonus plan  provides for a deferred payment. The bonus plan provides for a deferral  of compensation, and will not qualify as a short-term deferral   regardless of whether the bonus is paid or made available on or before  March 15, 2011 (and generally any payment before June 1, 2011 would  constitute an impermissible acceleration of a payment).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On November 1, 2008, Employer U awards a bonus to  Employee F such that Employee F has a legally binding right to the  payment as of November 1, 2008, that is not subject to a substantial  risk of forfeiture. The bonus plan provides for a lump sum payment upon  Employee F's separation from service. Because the separation from  service is an event that may occur after the applicable 2\1/2\ month  period, the bonus plan provides for a deferred payment and therefore  provides for a deferral of compensation. Accordingly, the bonus plan  will not qualify as a short-term deferral regardless of whether Employee  F separates from service and the bonus is paid or made available on or  before March 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. On November 1, 2008, Employer T grants Employee G a  legally binding right to the payment of a life annuity with the first  annuity payment on November 1, 2013, provided that Employee G continues  performing services for Employer T continuously through November 1,  2013. Because the life annuity is treated as a single payment, and  because all payments of the life annuity may not occur during the  applicable 2\1/2\ month period, the plan provides for a deferred payment  and none of the amounts payable under the annuity will qualify as a  short-term deferral, so that section 409A applies to all amounts that  are payable under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. On November 1, 2008, Employer S grants Employee H a stock  right providing for an exercise price less than the fair market value of  the underlying stock on November 1, 2008. The stock right is subject to  a substantial risk of forfeiture requiring services through November 1,  2010. The stock right becomes exercisable when the substantial risk of  forfeiture lapses and expires on November 1, 2013. Employee H continues  providing services through November 1, 2010, at which time the  substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. The stock right provides for a  deferred payment and will not qualify as a short-term deferral  regardless of whether Employee H exercises the stock right on or before  March 15, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other equity-based  compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock rights--(A) Nonstatutory stock options not  providing for the deferral of compensation.

A right to compensation based on the appreciation in value  of a specified number of shares of service recipient stock occurring  between the date of grant and the date of exercise of such right (a  stock appreciation right) does not provide for a deferral of  compensation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation payable under the stock appreciation right cannot  be greater than the excess of the fair market value of the stock  (disregarding lapse restrictions as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) on the  date the stock appreciation right is exercised over an amount specified  on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right (the stock  appreciation right exercise price), with respect to a number of shares  fixed on or before the date of grant of the right;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The stock appreciation right exercise price may never be less  than the fair market value of the underlying stock (disregarding lapse  restrictions as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) on the date the right is  granted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The stock appreciation right does not include any feature for  the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of  income until the exercise of the stock appreciation right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Stock rights that may provide for the deferral of compensation.  An option to purchase stock other than service recipient stock, or a  stock appreciation right with respect to stock other than service  recipient stock, generally will   provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of this  paragraph (b). If under the terms of an option to purchase service  recipient stock (other than an incentive stock option described in  section 422 or a stock option granted under an employee stock purchase  plan described in section 423), the exercise price is or could become  less than the fair market value of the stock (disregarding lapse  restrictions as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) on the date of grant, the  grant of the option generally will provide for the deferral of  compensation within the meaning of this paragraph (b). If under the  terms of a stock appreciation right with respect to service recipient  stock, the compensation payable under the stock appreciation right is or  could be any amount greater than, with respect to a predetermined number  of shares, the excess of the fair market value of the stock  (disregarding lapse restrictions as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) on the  date the stock appreciation right is exercised over the fair market  value of the stock (disregarding lapse restrictions as defined in Sec.  1.83-3(i)) on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right, the  grant of the stock appreciation right generally will provide for a  deferral of compensation within the meaning of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Feature for the deferral of compensation. To the extent a stock  right provides a right other than the right to receive cash or stock on  the date of exercise and such additional right would otherwise allow  compensation to be deferred beyond the date of exercise, the entire  arrangement (including the underlying stock right) provides for the  deferral of compensation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(i),  neither the right to receive substantially nonvested stock (as defined  in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) upon the exercise of a stock right, nor the right to  pay the exercise price with previously acquired shares, constitutes a  feature for the deferral of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Rights to dividends. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(i),  the right, directly or indirectly contingent upon the exercise of a  stock right, to receive an amount equal to all or part of the dividends  or other distributions (other than stock dividends described in  paragraph (b)(5)(v)(H) of this section) declared and paid on the number  of shares underlying the stock right between the date of grant and the  date of exercise of the stock right constitutes an offset to the  exercise price of the stock option or an increase in the amount payable  under the stock appreciation right (generally causing such stock right  to be subject to section 409A). A plan providing a right to dividends or  other distributions declared and paid on the number of shares underlying  a stock right, the payment of which is not contingent upon, or otherwise  payable on, the exercise of the stock right, may provide for a deferral  of compensation, but the existence of the right to receive such an  amount will not be treated as a reduction to the exercise price of (or  an increase to the compensation payable under) the stock right. Thus, a  right to such dividends or distributions that is not contingent,  directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of a stock right will not  cause the related stock right to fail to satisfy the requirements of the  exclusion from the definition of a deferral of compensation provided in  paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> does not apply to a  modification, extension, or renewal of a statutory option that is  treated as the grant of a new option that is not a statutory option. See  Sec. 1.424-1(e). In such event, the option is treated for purposes of  this paragraph (b) as if it had been a nonstatutory stock option from  the date of the original grant. Accordingly, if such modification,  extension, or renewal of the stock option would have been treated as the  grant of a new option or as causing the option to have had a deferral  feature from the date of grant under paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this  section, the modification, extension, or   renewal of the stock option is treated as the grant of a new option or  as causing the option to have had a deferral feature from the date of  grant for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Service recipient stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term service recipient  stock does not include a class of stock that has any preference as to  distributions other than distributions of service recipient stock and  distributions in liquidation of the issuer. The term service recipient  stock also does not include any stock that is subject to a mandatory  repurchase obligation (other than a right of first refusal), or a put or  call right that is not a lapse restriction as defined in Sec. 1.83- 3(i), if the stock price under such right or obligation is based on a  measure other than the fair market value (disregarding lapse  restrictions as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(i)) of the equity interest in  the corporation represented by the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> American depositary receipts.

For this purpose, the term mutual company unit  means a fixed percentage of the overall value of a non-stock mutual  company or association. For purposes of determining the value of the  mutual company unit, the unit may be valued in accordance with the rules  set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section governing valuation  of service recipient stock the shares of which are not traded on an  established securities market, applied as if the mutual company were a  stock corporation with one class of common stock and the number of  shares of such stock determined according to such fixed percentage. For  example, an appreciation right based on the appreciation of 10 mutual  company units, where each unit is defined as one percent of the overall  value of the mutual company, would be valued as if the appreciation  right were based upon 10 shares of a corporation, with 100 shares of  common stock (and no other class of stock), the shares of which are not  readily tradable on an established securities market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other entities. An interest in an entity other than a  corporation or non-stock mutual company or association may constitute  service recipient stock to the extent designated by the Commissioner in  revenue procedures, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Eligible issuer of service recipient stock--(1) In general. The  term eligible issuer of service recipient stock means only the  corporation for which the service provider provides direct services on  the date of grant of the stock right (if the entity receiving such  services is a corporation), and any corporation in a chain of  corporations or other entities in which each corporation or other entity  has a controlling interest in another corporation or other entity in the  chain, ending with the corporation or other entity that has a  controlling interest in the corporation or other entity for which the  service provider provides direct services on the date of grant of the  stock right. For this purpose, the term controlling interest has the  same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i), provided that the  language ``at least 50 percent'' is used instead of ``at least 80  percent'' each place it appears in Sec. 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i). In  addition, where the use of such stock with respect to the grant of a  stock right to such service provider is based upon legitimate business  criteria, the term controlling interest has the same meaning as provided  in Sec. 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i), provided that the language ``at least 20  percent'' is used instead of ``at least 80 percent'' each place it  appears in Sec. 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i). For purposes of determining  ownership   of an interest in an organization, the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.414(c)-3  and 1.414(c)-4 apply. The determination of whether a grant is based on  legitimate business criteria is based on the facts and circumstances,  focusing primarily on whether there is a sufficient nexus between the  service provider and the issuer of the stock right so that the grant  serves a legitimate non-tax business purpose other than simply providing  compensation to the service provider that is excluded from the  requirements of section 409A. For example, stock of a corporation that  owns an interest in a joint venture involving an operating business,  used with respect to stock rights granted to service providers of the  joint venture who are former service providers of such corporation,  generally will constitute use of service recipient stock based upon  legitimate business criteria, and therefore could constitute service  recipient stock with respect to such service providers if the  corporation owns at least 20 percent of the joint venture and the other  requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iii) are met. Similarly, the  legitimate business criteria requirement generally would be met if the  corporate venturer issued such a right to an employee of the joint  venture who it reasonably expected would in the future become an  employee of the corporate venturer. However, where a service provider  has no real nexus with a corporate venturer, such as generally happens  when the corporate venturer is a passive investor in the service  recipient joint venture, a stock right issued to that employee on the  investor corporation's stock generally would not be based upon  legitimate business criteria. Similarly, where a corporation holds only  a minority interest in an entity that in turn holds a minority interest  in the entity for which the service provider performs services, such  that the corporation holds only an insubstantial indirect interest in  the entity receiving the services, legitimate business criteria  generally would not exist for issuing a stock right on the corporation's  stock to the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Investment vehicles. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph  (b)(5)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, except as to a service provider  providing services directly to such corporation, for purposes of this  paragraph (b)(5), an eligible issuer of service recipient stock does not  include any corporation whose primary purpose is to serve as an  investment vehicle with respect to the corporation's minority ownership  interests in entities other than the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corporate structures established or transactions undertaken for  purposes of avoiding coverage under section 409A. Notwithstanding the  provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, an eligible  issuer of service recipient stock does not include any corporation  within a group of entities treated as a single service recipient if a  purpose of the establishment of the structure of the ownership, or a  purpose of a significant transaction between or among two or more  entities comprising a single service recipient, is to provide deferred  compensation not subject to the application of section 409A. If an  entity becomes a member of a group of corporations or other entities  treated as a single service recipient, and the primary source of income  or value of such entity arises from the provision of management services  to other members of the service recipient group, it is presumed that  such structure was established for purposes of avoiding the application  of section 409A if any stock rights are issued with respect to such  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Substitutions and assumptions by reason of a corporate  transaction. If the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(v)(D) of this  section are met such that the substitution of a new stock right pursuant  to a corporate transaction for an outstanding stock right, or the  assumption of an outstanding stock right pursuant to a corporate  transaction, would not be treated as the grant of a new stock right or a  change in the form of payment for purposes of this section and  Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6, the stock underlying the stock  right that replaced the stock right that is substituted or assumed will  be treated as service recipient stock for purposes of applying this  paragraph (b)(5) to the replacement stock rights if such underlying  stock otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A)  of   this section. For example, if by reason of a spinoff transaction (under  which the stock of a subsidiary corporation is distributed to the  stockholders of a distributing corporation), a stock option to purchase  distributing corporation stock is replaced with a stock option to  purchase distributing corporation stock and a stock option to purchase  the spun off subsidiary corporation's stock (each otherwise satisfying  the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section), and where  such substitution is not treated as a modification of the original stock  option pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(v)(D) of this section, both the  distributing corporation stock and the subsidiary corporation stock are  treated as service recipient stock for purposes of applying this  paragraph (b)(5) to the replacement stock options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, provided that the averaging period does not exceed 30  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Stock not readily tradable on an established securities market-- (1) In general. For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, in  the case of service recipient stock that is not readily tradable on an  established securities market, the fair market value of the stock as of  a valuation date means a value determined by the reasonable application  of a reasonable valuation method. The determination whether a valuation  method is reasonable, or whether an application of a valuation method is  reasonable, is made based on the facts and circumstances as of the  valuation date. Factors to be considered under a reasonable valuation  method include, as applicable, the value of tangible and intangible  assets of the corporation, the present value of anticipated future cash- flows of the corporation, the market value of stock or equity interests  in similar corporations and other entities engaged in trades or  businesses substantially similar to those engaged in by the corporation  the stock of which is to be valued, the value of which can be readily  determined through nondiscretionary, objective means (such as through  trading prices on an established securities market or an amount paid in  an arm's length private transaction), recent arm's length transactions  involving   the sale or transfer of such stock or equity interests, and other  relevant factors such as control premiums or discounts for lack of  marketability and whether the valuation method is used for other  purposes that have a material economic effect on the service recipient,  its stockholders, or its creditors. The use of a valuation method is not  reasonable if such valuation method does not take into consideration in  applying its methodology all available information material to the value  of the corporation. Similarly, the use of a value previously calculated  under a valuation method is not reasonable as of a later date if such  calculation fails to reflect information available after the date of the  calculation that may materially affect the value of the corporation (for  example, the resolution of material litigation or the issuance of a  patent) or the value was calculated with respect to a date that is more  than 12 months earlier than the date for which the valuation is being  used. The service recipient's consistent use of a valuation method to  determine the value of its stock or assets for other purposes, including  for purposes unrelated to compensation of service providers, is also a  factor supporting the reasonableness of such valuation method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Presumption of reasonableness. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(5)(iv)(B), the use of any of the following methods of valuation is  presumed to result in a reasonable valuation, provided that the  Commissioner may rebut such a presumption upon a showing that either the  valuation method or the application of such method was grossly  unreasonable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A valuation of a class of stock determined by an independent  appraisal that meets the requirements of section 401(a)(28)(C) and the  regulations as of a date that is no more than 12 months before the  relevant transaction to which the valuation is applied (for example, the  date of grant of a stock option).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> does not apply with respect to stock  subject to a stock right payable in stock, where the stock acquired  pursuant to the exercise of the stock right is transferable other than  through the operation of a nonlapse restriction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, a valuation will not  be treated as made reasonably and in good faith unless the valuation is  performed by a person or persons that the corporation reasonably  determines is qualified to perform such a valuation based on the  person's or persons'' significant knowledge, experience, education, or  training. Generally, a person will be qualified to perform such a  valuation if a reasonable individual, upon being apprised of such  knowledge, experience, education, and training, would reasonably rely on  the advice of such person with respect to valuation in deciding whether  to accept an offer to purchase or sell the stock being valued. For this  purpose, significant experience generally means at least five years of  relevant experience in business valuation or appraisal, financial  accounting, investment banking, private equity, secured lending, or  other comparable experience in the line of business or industry in which  the service recipient operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of alternative methods. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(5), a different valuation method may be used for each separate  action for which a valuation is relevant, provided that a single  valuation method is used for each separate action and, once used, may  not retroactively be altered. For example, one valuation method may be  used to establish the exercise price of a stock option, and a different  valuation method may be used to determine the value at the date of the  repurchase of stock pursuant to a put or call right. However, once an  exercise price or amount to be paid has been established, the exercise  price or amount to be paid may not be changed through the retroactive  use of another valuation method. In addition, notwithstanding the  foregoing, where after the date of grant, but before the date of  exercise or transfer, of the stock right, the service recipient stock to  which the stock right relates becomes readily tradable on an established  securities market, the service recipient must use the valuation method  set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section for purposes of  determining the payment at the date of exercise or the purchase of the  stock, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Modifications, extensions, substitutions, and assumptions of  stock rights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Treatment of modified and extended stock rights. A  modification of the terms of a stock right within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(5)(v)(B) of this section is considered to be the grant of  a new stock right. The new stock right may or may not constitute a  deferral of compensation under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section,  determined at the date of grant of the new stock right. If there is an  extension of a stock right (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)  of this section), the stock right is treated as having had an additional  deferral feature from the original date of grant of the stock right, and  therefore will be treated as a plan providing for the deferral of  compensation from the original grant date for purposes of this paragraph  (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Modification in general. Except as otherwise provided in  paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section, the term modification means any  change in the terms of the stock right (or change in the terms of the  plan pursuant to which the stock right was granted or in the terms of  any other agreement governing the stock right) that may provide the  holder of the stock right with a direct or indirect reduction in the  exercise price of the stock right regardless of whether the holder in  fact benefits from the change in terms. A change in the terms of the  stock right shortening the period during which the stock right is  exercisable is not a modification. It is not a modification to add a  feature providing the ability to tender previously acquired stock for  the stock purchasable under the stock right, or to withhold or have  withheld shares of stock to facilitate the payment of the exercise price  or the employment taxes or required withholding taxes resulting from the  exercise of the stock right. In addition, it is not a modification for  the grantor to exercise discretion specifically reserved under a stock  right with respect to the transferability of the stock right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Extensions--(1) In general. An extension of a stock right refers  to the provision to the holder of an additional   period of time within which to exercise the stock right beyond the time  originally prescribed under the terms of the stock right, the conversion  or exchange of a stock right for a legally binding right to compensation  in a future taxable year, or the addition of any feature for the  deferral of compensation not permitted in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A)(3) of  this section (in the case of a stock option) or not permitted in  paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)(3) of this section (in the case of a stock  appreciation right) to the terms of the stock right, other than at a  time when the exercise price of the stock right equals or exceeds the  fair market value of the service recipient stock that could be purchased  (in the case of an option) or the fair market value of the service  recipient stock used to determine the payment to the service provider  (in the case of a stock appreciation right), and includes a renewal of  such right that has such effect. It is not an extension if the exercise  period of a stock right is extended to a date no later than the earlier  of the latest date upon which the stock right could have expired by its  original terms under any circumstances or the 10th anniversary of the  original date of grant of the stock right. If the exercise period of a  stock right is extended at a time when the exercise price of the stock  right equals or exceeds the fair market value of the service recipient  stock that could be purchased (in the case of an option) or the fair  market value of the service recipient stock used to determine the  payment to the service provider (in the case of a stock appreciation  right), it is not an extension of the original stock right. Instead, in  such a case, the original stock right is treated as modified rather than  extended and a new stock right is treated as having been granted for  purposes of this section. In addition, it is not an extension of a stock  right if the expiration of the stock right is tolled while the holder  cannot exercise the stock right because such an exercise would violate  an applicable Federal, state, local, or foreign law, or would jeopardize  the ability of the service recipient to continue as a going concern,  provided that the period during which the stock right may be exercised  is not extended more than 30 days after the exercise of the stock right  first would no longer violate an applicable Federal, state, local, and  foreign laws or would first no longer jeopardize the ability of the  service recipient to continue as a going concern. For this purpose, a  provision of foreign law shall be considered applicable only to foreign  earned income (as defined under section 911(b)(1) without regard to  section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without regard to the requirement that the  income be attributable to services performed during the period described  in section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) from sources within the foreign country  that promulgated such law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> affects any other action treated as the extension of a  stock right, including the addition of a deferral feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C). In the examples, each employee is an  individual employed by the specified employer, and each employee and  each employer has a calendar year taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 2009, Employer Z grants Employee A a  nonstatutory stock option that does not provide for the deferral of  compensation in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section.  The terms of the nonstatutory stock option provide that the exercise  period of the stock option expires on the earlier of July 1, 2019, or 3  months after Employee A's separation from service. On   July 1, 2011, Employee A separates from service. On the same day,  Employee A and Employer Z change the exercise period of the option so  that it expires on July 1, 2013. Because the exercise period of the  stock right is not extended beyond July 1, 2019, the change is not an  extension for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that  Employee A separates from service on July 1, 2018, and on the same day,  Employee A and Employer Z change the exercise period of the option so  that it expires on July 1, 2020. As of July 1, 2018, the fair market  value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Because the  exercise period of the stock right is extended beyond July 1, 2019, the  change is an extension for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that as of  July 1, 2018, the fair market value of the underlying stock is less than  the exercise price of the option. Because the exercise period of the  stock right is extended at a time when the fair market value of the  underlying stock is less than the exercise price, the change is not an  extension for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C) and the change is  treated as a modification of the option, resulting in the extension of  the exercise period being treated as the grant of a new option on July  1, 2018.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On July 1, 2009, Employer Y grants to Employee B a stock  appreciation right with respect to 200 shares of Employer Y common stock  that does not provide for the deferral of compensation in accordance  with paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section. Upon exercise of the stock  appreciation right, Employee B is entitled to receive the excess of the  fair market value of a share of Employer Y common stock on the date of  exercise over $100 (the fair market value of a share of Employer Y  common stock on July 1, 2009), multiplied by the number of shares with  respect to which Employee B is exercising the right. The exercise period  of the right expires on the earlier of July 1, 2019, or 3 months after  Employee B separates from service. Employee B cannot exercise the stock  appreciation right with respect to more than 100 shares unless Employee  B continues to be employed by Employer Y through June 30, 2014. On July  1, 2011, when the fair market value of a share of Employer Y common  stock is $200, Employee B and Employer Y amend the stock appreciation  right to provide that the right will be exercisable only during calendar  year 2018, except that before January 1, 2017, Employee B may elect to  designate calendar year 2023 or any subsequent calendar year before 2033  as the year in which the right will be exercisable. The amendment  constitutes an extension of the stock appreciation right under paragraph  (b)(5)(v)(C)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(5)(v)(A) of this  section, the stock appreciation right is treated as having had an  additional deferral feature from the original date of grant (July 1,  2009) of the right, and therefore is treated as a plan providing for the  deferral of compensation from that date. During the period from July 1,  2009, through June 30, 2011, the provisions of the stock appreciation  right relating to the time and form of payment did not satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 1.409A-3(a). Therefore, the stock appreciation  right provides for a deferral of compensation that does not comply with  section 409A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Substitutions and assumptions of stock rights by reason of a  corporate transaction. If the requirements of Sec. 1.424-1 (without  regard to the requirement described in Sec. 1.424-1(a)(2) that an  eligible corporation be the employer of the optionee) would be met if  the stock right were a statutory option, the substitution of a new stock  right pursuant to a corporate transaction (as defined in Sec. 1.424- 1(a)(3)) for an outstanding stock right or the assumption of an  outstanding stock right pursuant to a corporate transaction will not be  treated as the grant of a new stock right or a change in the form of  payment for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through  1.409A-6. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the requirement of  Sec. 1.424-1(a)(5)(iii) will be deemed to be satisfied if the ratio of  the exercise price to the fair market value of the shares subject to the  stock right immediately after the substitution or assumption is not  greater than the ratio of the exercise price to the fair market value of  the shares subject to the stock right immediately before the  substitution or assumption. In the case of a transaction described in  section 355 in which the stock of the distributing corporation and the  stock distributed in the transaction are both readily tradable on an  established securities market immediately after the transaction, for  purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(v), the requirements of Sec. 1.424- 1(a)(5) related to the fair market value of the stock may be satisfied  by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Using the last sale before or the first sale after the specified  date as of which such valuation is being made, the closing price on the  last trading day before or the trading day of a specified date, the  arithmetic mean of the high and low prices on the last trading day  before or the trading day of such   specified date, or any other reasonable method using actual transactions  in such stock as reported by such market on a specified date, for the  stock of the distributing corporation and the stock distributed in the  transaction, provided the specified date is designated before such  specified date, and such specified date is not more than 60 days after  the transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Using the arithmetic mean of such market prices on trading days  during a specified period designated before the beginning of such  specified period, where such specified period is not longer than 30 days  and ends no later than 60 days after the transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Using an average of such prices during such prespecified period  weighted based on the volume of trading of such stock on each trading  day during such prespecified period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Acceleration of date when exercisable. Although with respect to  a stock right not immediately exercisable in full, a change in the terms  of the right solely to accelerate or delay, within the original term of  the stock right, the time at which the stock right (or any portion of  such stock right) may be exercised is not a modification for purposes of  this section, with respect to a stock right subject to section 409A,  such an acceleration may constitute an impermissible acceleration of a  payment date under Sec. 1.409A-3(j) or a subsequent deferral under  Sec. 1.409A-2(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Discretionary added benefits. If a change to a stock right  provides, either by its terms or in substance, that the holder may  receive an additional benefit under the stock right at the future  discretion of the grantor, and the addition of such benefit would  constitute a modification or extension, then the addition of such  discretion is a modification or extension at the time that the stock  right is changed to provide such discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Change in underlying stock increasing value. A change in the  terms of the stock subject to a stock right that increases the value of  the stock is a modification of such stock right, except to the extent  that a new stock right is substituted for such stock right by reason of  the change in the terms of the stock in accordance with paragraph  (b)(5)(v)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Change in the number of shares purchasable. If a stock right is  amended solely to increase the number of shares subject to the stock  right, the increase is not considered a modification of the stock right  but is treated as the grant of a new additional stock right to which the  additional shares are subject. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if  the exercise price and number of shares subject to a stock right are  proportionally adjusted to reflect a stock split (including a reverse  stock split) or stock dividend, and the only effect of the stock split  or stock dividend is to increase (or decrease) on a pro rata basis the  number of shares owned by each shareholder of the class of stock subject  to the stock right, then there is no modification of the stock right if  it is proportionally adjusted to reflect the stock split or stock  dividend and the aggregate exercise price of the stock right is not less  than the aggregate exercise price before the stock split or stock  dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Rescission of changes. A change to the terms of a stock right  (or change in the terms of the plan pursuant to which the stock right  was granted or in the terms of any other agreement governing the right)  is not considered a modification or extension of the stock right to the  extent the change in the terms of the stock right is rescinded by the  earlier of the date the stock right is exercised or the last day of the  service provider's taxable year during which such change occurred. Thus,  for example, if the terms of a stock right granted to an individual  employee with a calendar year taxable year are changed on March 1 in a  manner that would result in an extension of the stock right, and the  change is rescinded on November 1 of the same year, and the stock right  is not exercised before the change is rescinded, the stock right is not  considered extended under this paragraph (b)(5)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Successive modifications and extensions. The rules of this  paragraph (b)(5)(v) apply as well to successive modifications and  extensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Modifications and extensions in effect on October 23, 2004. For  purposes of the application of section 409A and   these regulations to a stock right, if a legally binding right to a  modification or extension of such stock right existed on October 23,  2004, such modification or extension is disregarded, and the stock right  is treated as if granted with the terms and conditions in effect on  October 23, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>. An option may be granted as part of or in  conjunction with an employee stock purchase plan or subscription  contract. An option must be in writing (in paper or electronic form)  provided that such writing is adequate to establish an option right or  privilege that is enforceable under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Date of grant of option. (1) The language the date of grant of  the option, and similar phrases, refer to the date when the granting  corporation completes the corporate action necessary to create the  legally binding right constituting the option. A corporate action  creating the legally binding right constituting the option is not  considered complete until the date on which the maximum number of shares  that can be purchased under the option and the minimum exercise price  are fixed or determinable, and the class of underlying stock and the  identity of the service provider is designated. Ordinarily, if the  corporate action provides for an immediate offer of stock for sale to a  service provider, or provides for a particular date on which such offer  is to be made, the date of the granting of the option is the date of  such corporate action if the offer is to be made immediately, or the  date provided as the date of the offer, as the case may be. However, an  unreasonable delay in the giving of notice of such offer to the service  provider will be taken into account as indicating that the corporation  provided that the offer was to be made at the subsequent date on which  such notice is given.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the corporation imposes a condition on the granting of an  option (as distinguished from a condition governing the exercise of the  option), such condition generally will be given effect in accordance  with the intent of the corporation. However, if the grant of an option  is subject to approval by stockholders, the date of grant of the option  will be determined as if the option had not been subject to such  approval. A condition that does not require corporate action, such as  the approval of, or registration with, some regulatory or government  agency, for example, a stock exchange or the Securities and Exchange  Commission, is ordinarily considered a condition upon the exercise of  the option unless the corporate action clearly indicates that the option  is not to be granted until such condition has been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In general, a condition imposed upon the exercise of an option  will not operate to make ineffective the granting of the option. For  example, on June 1, 2008, Corporation A grants to X, an employee, an  option to purchase 5,000 shares of the corporation's common stock,  exercisable by X on or after June 1, 2009, provided X is employed by the  corporation on June 1, 2009, and provided that A's profits during the  fiscal year preceding the year of exercise exceed $200,000. Such an  option is granted to X on June 1, 2008, and will be treated as  outstanding as of such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Stock. The term stock means capital stock of any class,  including voting or nonvoting common or preferred stock. Except as  otherwise provided, the term stock includes both treasury stock and  stock of original issue. Special classes of stock authorized to be  issued to and held by employees are within the scope of the term stock  for this purpose, provided such stock otherwise possesses the rights and  characteristics of capital stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exercise price. The term exercise price means the consideration  in cash or property that, pursuant to the terms of the option, is the  price at which the stock subject to the option is purchased. The term  exercise price does not include any amounts paid as interest under a  deferred payment plan or treated as interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Exercise. The term exercise, when used in reference to an  option, means the act of acceptance by the holder of the option of the  offer to sell contained in the option. In general, the time of exercise  is the time when there is a sale or a contract to sell between the  corporation and the individual. A promise to pay the exercise price does  not constitute an exercise of the option unless the holder of the option  is subject to personal liability on such promise. An agreement or  undertaking by the service provider to make payments under a stock  purchase plan does not constitute the exercise of an option to the  extent the payments made remain subject to withdrawal by or refund to  the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Transfer. The term transfer, when used in reference to the  transfer to an individual of a share of stock pursuant to the exercise  of an option, means the transfer of ownership of such share, or the  transfer of substantially all the rights of ownership. Such transfer  must, within a reasonable time, be evidenced on the books of the  corporation. A transfer may occur even if a share of stock is subject to  a substantial risk of forfeiture or is not otherwise transferable  immediately after the date of exercise. A transfer does not fail to  occur merely because, under the terms of the arrangement, the individual  may not dispose of the share for a specified period of time, or the  share is subject to a right of first refusal or a right to acquire the  share at the share's fair market value at the time of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Readily tradable. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6, stock is treated as readily tradable if it is  regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Application to stock appreciation rights. For purposes of this  section and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6, the definitions  provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(vi)(A) through (G) of this section may be  applied by analogy to the issuance of, exercise of, or payment upon the  exercise of, a stock appreciation right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, a transfer of property includes the transfer of a  beneficial interest in a trust or annuity plan, or a transfer to or from  a trust or under an annuity plan, to the extent such a transfer is  subject to section 83, section 402(b) or section 403(c). In addition,  for purposes of this paragraph (b), a right to compensation income that  will be required to be included in income under section 402(b)(4)(A) is  not a deferral of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Promises to transfer property. A plan under which a service  provider obtains a legally binding right to receive property in a future  taxable year where the property will be substantially vested (as defined  in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) at the time of transfer of the property may provide  for the deferral of compensation and, accordingly, may constitute a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan. A legally binding right to  receive property in a future taxable year where the property will be  substantially nonvested (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) at the time of  transfer of the property will not provide for the deferral of  compensation and, accordingly, will not constitute a nonqualified  deferred compensation plan unless offered in conjunction with another  legally binding right that constitutes a deferral of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Arrangements between partnerships and partners. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain foreign plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plans with respect to compensation  covered by treaty or other international agreement. A plan in which a  service provider participates   does not provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes of this  paragraph (b) to the extent that the compensation under the plan would  have been excluded from gross income for Federal income tax purposes  under the provisions of any bilateral income tax convention or other  bilateral or multilateral agreement to which the United States is a  party if the compensation had been paid to the service provider at the  time that the legally binding right to the compensation first arose or,  if later, the time that the legally binding right was no longer subject  to a substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plans with respect to certain other compensation. A plan in  which a service provider participates does not provide for a deferral of  compensation for purposes of this paragraph (b) to the extent that  compensation under the plan would not have been includible in gross  income for Federal tax purposes if it had been paid to the service  provider at the time that the legally binding right to the compensation  first arose or, if later, the time that the legally binding right was no  longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, due to one of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The service provider was a nonresident alien at such time and  the compensation would not have been includible in gross income under  section 872.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(iv))</em> if paid at such time, and the amount  of such compensation was equal to or less than the excess (if any) of  the maximum exclusion amount under section 911(b)(2)(D) for such taxable  year over the amount of foreign earned income actually excluded from  gross income by such qualified individual for such taxable year under  section 911(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The compensation would have been excludible from gross income  under section 893.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The compensation would have been excludible from gross income  under section 931 or section 933.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, the term tax equalization agreement refers to an agreement,  method, program, or other arrangement that provides payments intended to  compensate the service provider for some or all of the excess of the  taxes actually imposed by a foreign jurisdiction on the compensation  paid by the service recipient to the service provider over the taxes  that would be imposed if the compensation were subject solely to United  States Federal, state, and local income tax, or some or all of the  excess of the United States Federal, state, and local income tax  actually imposed on the compensation paid by the service to the service  provider over the taxes that would be imposed if the compensation were  subject solely to taxes in the foreign jurisdiction, provided that the  payment made under such agreement, method, program, or other arrangement  may not exceed such excess and the amount necessary to compensate for  the additional taxes on the amount paid under the agreement, method,  program, or other arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the term  foreign plan means a plan that, together with all substantially similar  plans, is maintained by a service recipient for a substantial number of  participants, substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens or  resident aliens classified as resident aliens solely under section  7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) (and not section 7701(b)(1)(A)(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Additional foreign plans. A plan in which a service provider  participates does not provide for a deferral of compensation for  purposes of this paragraph (b) to the extent designated by the  Commissioner in revenue procedures, notices, or other guidance published  in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Earnings. Earnings on compensation excluded from the definition  of deferral of compensation pursuant to this paragraph (b)(8) are also  not treated as a deferral of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Separation pay plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A plan that otherwise  provides for a deferral of compensation under this paragraph (b) does  not fail to provide a deferral of compensation merely because the right  to payment of the compensation is conditioned upon a separation from  service. However, paragraphs (b)(9)(ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of this  section provide rules concerning the extent to which certain separation  pay plans do not provide for the deferral of compensation. The  exceptions contained in paragraphs (b)(9)(ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of  this section may be used in combination, such that compensation under a  plan that would be excepted under one of those paragraphs may be treated  as excepted under another of those paragraphs, so that other  compensation under a plan may be treated as excepted under the first of  such paragraphs. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph  (b)(9), any payment or benefit, or entitlement to a payment or benefit,  that acts as a substitute for, or replacement of, amounts deferred by  the service recipient under a separate nonqualified deferred  compensation plan constitutes a payment or a deferral of compensation  under the separate nonqualified deferred compensation plan, and does not  constitute a payment or deferral of compensation under a separation pay  plan. If a service provider receives a payment at separation from  service and also has a legally binding right to an amount of deferred  compensation that would be forfeited upon the separation from service,  whether the payment acts as an acceleration of vesting and substitute  payment for the amount of deferred compensation forfeited, or whether  the deferred compensation is treated as forfeited and the amount paid is  treated as a separate payment of current compensation, is determined  based on the facts and circumstances, provided that, where the  separation from service is voluntary, it is presumed that the payment  results from an acceleration of vesting followed by a payment of the  deferred compensation that is subject to section 409A. Accordingly, any  change in the payment schedule to accelerate or defer the payments would  be subject to the rules of section 409A. The presumption that a right to  a payment is not a new right, but is instead a right substituted for a  pre-existing forfeited right, may be rebutted by demonstrating that the  service provider would have obtained the right to the payment regardless  of the forfeiture of the nonvested right. A factor indicating that the  service provider would have obtained a right to a payment regardless of  the forfeiture of the nonvested right is that the amount to which the  service provider obtains a right is materially less than an amount   equal to the present value of the forfeited amount multiplied by a  fraction, the numerator of which is the period of service the service  provider actually completed, and the denominator of which is the full  period of service the service provider would have been required to  complete to receive the full amount of the payment. For example, where a  service provider is entitled to a future payment only if the service  provider completes three years of service and at the time of termination  the service provider has completed one year of service, the presumption  could be rebutted if the payment to the service provider is materially  less than the present value of one-third of the nonvested amount.  Another such factor is that the payment to the service provider is of a  type customarily made to service providers who separate from service  with the service recipient and do not forfeit nonvested rights to  deferred compensation (for example, a payment of accrued but unused  leave or a payment for a release of actual or potential claims).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collectively bargained separation pay plans. A separation pay  plan does not provide for a deferral of compensation to the extent the  plan is a collectively bargained separation pay plan that provides for  separation pay only upon an involuntary separation from service or  pursuant to a window program. Only the portion of the separation pay  plan attributable to employees covered by a bona fide collective  bargaining agreement is considered to be provided under a collectively  bargained separation pay plan. A collectively bargained separation pay  plan is a separation pay plan that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The separation pay plan is contained within an agreement that  the Secretary of Labor determines to be a collective bargaining  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The separation pay provided by the collective bargaining  agreement was the subject of arm's length negotiations between employee  representatives and one or more employers, and the agreement between  employee representatives and one or more employers satisfies section  7701(a)(46).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The circumstances surrounding the agreement evidence good faith  bargaining between adverse parties over the separation pay to be  provided under the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Separation pay due to involuntary separation from service or  participation in a window program. A separation pay plan that is not  described in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section and that provides for  separation pay only upon an involuntary separation from service (as  defined in paragraph (n) of this section) or pursuant to a window  program does not provide for a deferral of compensation to the extent  that the separation pay, or portion of the separation pay, provided  under the plan meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The separation pay (other than amounts described in paragraphs  (b)(9)(iv) and (v) of this section) does not exceed two times the lesser  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sum of the service provider's annualized compensation based  upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the service  recipient for the taxable year of the service provider preceding the  taxable year of the service provider in which the service provider has a  separation from service with such service recipient (adjusted for any  increase during that year that was expected to continue indefinitely if  the service provider had not separated from service); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The maximum amount that may be taken into account under a  qualified plan pursuant to section 401(a)(17) for the year in which the  service provider has a separation from service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plan provides that the separation pay described in paragraph  (b)(9)(iii)(A) of this section must be paid no later than the last day  of the second taxable year of the service provider following the taxable  year of the service provider in which occurs the separation from  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> and without regard to the  requirement that the income be attributable to services performed during  the period described in section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) from sources within  the foreign country that promulgated such law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, the reimbursement of reasonable moving expenses  includes the reimbursement of all or part of any loss the service  provider actually incurs due to the sale of a primary residence in  connection with a separation from service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Medical benefits. To the extent a separation pay plan (including  a plan providing payments due to a voluntary separation from service)  entitles a service provider to reimbursement by the service recipient of  payments of medical expenses incurred and paid by the service provider  but not reimbursed by a person other than the service recipient and  allowable as a deduction under section 213 (disregarding the requirement  of section 213(a) that the deduction is available only to the extent  that such expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income), such  plan does not provide for a deferral of compensation to the extent such  rights apply during the period of time during which the service provider  would be entitled (or would, but for such plan, be entitled) to  continuation coverage under a group health plan of the service recipient  under section 4980B (COBRA) if the service provider elected such  coverage and paid the applicable premiums.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In-kind benefits and direct service recipient payments. A  service provider's entitlement to in-kind benefits from the service  recipient, or a payment by the service recipient directly to the person  providing the goods or services to the service provider, is treated as  not providing for a deferral of compensation for purposes of this  paragraph (b), if a right to reimbursement by the service recipient for  a payment for such benefits, goods, or services by the service provider  would not be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under  this paragraph (b)(9)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Limited payments. If not otherwise excluded, a taxpayer may  treat a right or rights under a separation pay plan to a payment or  payments as not providing for a deferral of compensation to the extent  such payments in the aggregate do not exceed the applicable dollar  amount under section 402(g)(1)(B) for the year of the separation from  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Limited period of time. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(9)(v)(A)  and (C) of this section, a limited period of time in which expenses may  be incurred, or in which in-kind benefits may be provided by the service  recipient or a third party that the service recipient will pay, does not  include periods beyond the last day of the second taxable year of the  service provider following the taxable year of the service provider in  which the separation from service occurred, provided that the period  during which the reimbursements for such expenses must be paid may not  extend beyond the third taxable year of the service provider following  the taxable year of the service provider in which the separation from  service occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Window programs--definition. The term window program refers to  a program established by a service recipient in connection with an  impending separation from service to provide separation pay, where such  program is made   available by the service recipient for a limited period of time (no  longer than 12 months) to service providers who separate from service  during that period or to service providers who separate from service  during that period under specified circumstances. A program will not be  considered a window program if a service recipient establishes a pattern  of repeatedly providing for similar separation pay in similar situations  for substantially consecutive, limited periods of time. Whether the  recurrence of these programs constitutes a pattern is determined based  on the facts and circumstances. Although no one factor is determinative,  relevant factors include whether the benefits are on account of a  specific business event or condition, the degree to which the separation  pay relates to the event or condition, and whether the event or  condition is temporary or discrete or is a permanent aspect of the  employer's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Certain indemnification and liability insurance plans. A plan  in which a service provider participates does not provide for a deferral  of compensation for purposes of this paragraph (b) to the extent that  the plan provides (to the extent permissible under applicable law), for  the indemnification of, or the purchase of an insurance policy providing  for payments of, all or part of the expenses incurred or damages paid or  payable by a service provider with respect to a bona fide claim against  the service provider or service recipient, including amounts paid or  payable by the service provider upon the settlement of a bona fide claim  against the service provider or service recipient, where such claim is  based on actions or failures to act by the service provider in his or  her capacity as a service provider of the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> does not apply to any deferred amounts that did not  arise as a result of an actual bona fide claim for damages under  applicable law, such as amounts that would have been deferred or paid  regardless of the existence of such claim, even if such amounts are paid  or modified as part of a settlement or award resolving an actual bona  fide claim. For this purpose, a provision of foreign law shall be  considered applicable only to foreign earned income (as defined under  section 911(b)(1) without regard to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without  regard to the requirement that the income be attributable to services  performed during the period described in section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B))  from sources within the foreign country that promulgated such law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em>, the term educational benefits refers  solely to benefits provided to a service provider, consisting solely of  educational assistance for the education of the service provider, as  defined in section 127(c) and the accompanying regulations, and does not  refer to any benefits provided for the education of any other person,  including any spouse, child, or other family member of the service  provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term plan includes any agreement,  method, program, or other arrangement, including an agreement, method,  program, or other arrangement that applies to one   person or individual. A plan may be adopted unilaterally by the service  recipient or may be negotiated or agreed to by the service recipient and  one or more service providers or service provider representatives. An  agreement, method, program, or other arrangement may constitute a plan  regardless of whether it is an employee benefit plan under section 3(3)  of ERISA, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1002(3)). The requirements of section  409A are applied as if a separate plan or plans is maintained for each  service provider. For purposes of determining the terms of a plan,  general provisions of the plan that purport to nullify noncompliant plan  terms, or to supply any specific plan terms required by this section,  Sec. 1.409A-2 or Sec. 1.409A-3, are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan aggregation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided, the following rules apply with respect to the application of  this section and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6 to deferrals of  compensation with respect to a service provider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All deferrals of compensation at the election of that service  provider under all plans of the service recipient that are account  balance plans, except to the extent that the plan is described in  paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) of this section, are  treated as deferred under a single plan. For purposes of this paragraph,  the term account balance plan means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)(B)</em> of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(A)(1)</em> of this section if the service  provider were an employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, the term  ``account balance plan'' has the same meaning as provided in paragraph  (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, the term nonaccount balance plan means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)(B)</em> of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(C)(1)</em> of this section if the service  provider were an employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All deferrals of compensation with respect to that service  provider under all separation pay plans (as defined in paragraph (m) of  this section) of the service recipient to the extent an amount deferred  under the plans is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(E) of this  section and is payable solely upon an involuntary separation from  service within the meaning of paragraph (n) of this section or as a  result of participation in a window program, are treated as deferred  under a single plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> All deferrals of compensation with respect to that service  provider under all plans of the service recipient to the extent such  amounts deferred consist of rights to in-kind benefits or reimbursements  of expenses, such as membership fees, or expenses related to aircraft or  vehicle usage, to the extent that the right to the in-kind benefit or  reimbursement, separately or in the aggregate, does not constitute a   substantial portion of either the overall compensation earned by the  service provider for performing services for the service recipient or  the overall compensation received due to a separation from service, are  treated as deferred under a single plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> All deferrals of compensation with respect to that service  provider under all plans of the service recipient to the extent that the  taxation of such compensation is governed by Sec. 1.61-22 or Sec.  1.7872-15 (split-dollar life insurance arrangements), or the taxation of  such compensation would be governed by Sec. 1.61-22 or Sec. 1.7872-15  but for the operation of Sec. 1.61-22(j) (effective date provisions),  are treated as deferred under a single plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> (a  domestic arrangement), are treated as deferred under a single plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> All deferrals of compensation with respect to that service  provider under all plans of the service recipient to the extent such  plans are stock rights (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section)  subject to section 409A, are treated as deferred under a single plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> All deferrals of compensation with respect to that service  provider under all plans of the service recipient to the extent such  plans are not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E),  (F), (G), or (H) of this section are treated as deferred under a single  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dual status. Agreements, methods, programs, and other  arrangements in which a service provider participates are not aggregated  with other agreements, methods, programs, and other arrangements to the  extent the service provider participates in one set of agreements,  methods, programs, and other arrangements due to status as an employee  of the service recipient (employee arrangements) and another set of  agreements, methods, programs, and other arrangements due to status as  an independent contractor of the service recipient (independent  contractor arrangements). For example, where a service provider deferred  amounts under an independent contractor arrangement while providing  services as an independent contractor, and then becomes eligible for and  defers amounts under a separate employee arrangement after being hired  as an employee, the two arrangements will not be aggregated for purposes  of this paragraph (c)(2). Where an employee also is a member of the  board of directors of the service recipient (or a similar position with  respect to a non-corporate service recipient), the arrangements under  which the employee participates as a director (director arrangements)  are not aggregated with employee arrangements, provided that the  director arrangements are substantially similar to arrangements provided  to service providers providing services only as directors (or similar  positions with respect to non-corporate service recipients). For  example, an employee director who participates in an employee  arrangement and a director arrangement generally may treat the two  arrangements as separate plans, provided that the director arrangement  is substantially similar to arrangements providing benefits to non- employee directors. To the extent a plan in which an employee director  participates is not substantially similar to arrangements   in which non-employee directors participate, such plan is treated as an  employee plan for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2). Director plans and  independent contractor plans are aggregated for purposes of this  paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> by the end of  the taxable year of the service provider in which the legally binding  right arises, or with respect to an amount not payable in the year  immediately following the taxable year of the service provider in which  the legally binding right arises (the subsequent year), the 15th day of  the third month of the subsequent year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial deferral election provisions. If a plan provides a  service provider or a service recipient with an initial deferral  election, the plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)  if the plan sets forth in writing, on or before the date the applicable  election is required to be irrevocable to satisfy the requirements of  Sec. 1.409A-2(a), the conditions under which such election may be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent deferral election provisions. If a plan permits a  subsequent deferral election described in Sec. 1.409A-2(b), the plan  satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) if the plan sets  forth in writing, on or before the date the election is required to be  irrevocable to meet the requirements of Sec. 1.409A-2(b), the  conditions under which such election may be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Payment accelerations. Except as explicitly provided in Sec.  1.409A-3, a plan is not required to set forth in writing the conditions  under which a payment may be accelerated if such acceleration is  permitted under Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Six-month delay for specified employees. A plan must provide  that distributions to a specified employee may not be made before the  date that is six months after the date of separation from service or, if  earlier, the date of death (the six-month delay rule). The six-month  delay rule, required for payments due to the separation from service of  a specified employee, must be written in the plan. A plan does not fail  to be established and maintained merely because it does not contain the  six-month delay rule when the service provider who has a right to  compensation deferred under such plan is not a specified employee.  However, such provision must be set forth in writing on or before the  date such service provider first becomes a specified employee. In  general, this means the provision must be set forth in writing on or  before the specified employee effective date (as defined in paragraph  (i)(3) of this section) for the first list of specified employees that  includes such service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Plan amendments. In the case of an amendment that increases the  amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the  plan is not considered established with respect to the additional amount  deferred until the plan, as amended, is established in accordance with  paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Transition rule for written plan requirement. For purposes of  this paragraph (c)(3), a legally enforceable unwritten plan that was  adopted and effective before December 31, 2007, is   treated as established under this section as of the later of the date on  which it was adopted or became effective, provided that the material  terms of the plan are set forth in writing on or before December 31,  2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Plan aggregation rules. The plan aggregation rules of  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section do not apply to the written plan  requirements of this paragraph (c)(3). Accordingly, deferrals of  compensation under an agreement, method, program, or other arrangement  that fails to meet the requirements of section 409A solely due to a  failure to meet the written plan requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)  are not aggregated with deferrals of compensation under other  agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements that meet such  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Substantial risk of forfeiture--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Compensation is  subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if entitlement to the amount  is conditioned on the performance of substantial future services by any  person or the occurrence of a condition related to a purpose of the  compensation, and the possibility of forfeiture is substantial. For  purposes of this paragraph (d), a condition related to a purpose of the  compensation must relate to the service provider's performance for the  service recipient or the service recipient's business activities or  organizational goals (for example, the attainment of a prescribed level  of earnings or equity value or completion of an initial public  offering). For purposes of this paragraph (d), if a service provider's  entitlement to the amount is conditioned on the occurrence of the  service provider's involuntary separation from service without cause,  the right is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if the  possibility of forfeiture is substantial. An amount is not subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture merely because the right to the amount is  conditioned, directly or indirectly, upon the refraining from the  performance of services. Except as provided with respect to certain  transaction-based compensation under Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv), the  addition of any risk of forfeiture after the legally binding right to  the compensation arises, or any extension of a period during which  compensation is subject to a risk of forfeiture, is disregarded for  purposes of determining whether such compensation is subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture. An amount will not be considered subject  to a substantial risk of forfeiture beyond the date or time at which the  recipient otherwise could have elected to receive the amount of  compensation, unless the present value of the amount subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture (disregarding, in determining the present  value, the risk of forfeiture) is materially greater than the present  value of the amount the recipient otherwise could have elected to  receive absent such risk of forfeiture. For this purpose, compensation  that the service provider would receive for continuing to perform  services regardless of whether the service provider elected to receive  the amount that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture is not  taken into account in determining whether the present value of the right  to the amount subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture is materially  greater than the amount the recipient otherwise could have elected to  receive absent such risk of forfeiture. For example, a salary deferral  generally may not be made subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  But, for example, where a bonus plan provides an election between a cash  payment or restricted stock units with a present value that is  materially greater (disregarding the risk of forfeiture) than the  present value of such cash payment and that will be forfeited absent  continued services for a period of years, the right to the restricted  stock units generally will be treated as subject to a substantial risk  of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock rights. A stock right is not subject to a substantial risk  of forfeiture at the earlier of the first date the holder may exercise  the stock right and receive cash or property that is substantially  vested (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) or the first date that the stock  right is not subject to a forfeiture condition that would constitute a  substantial risk of forfeiture. Accordingly, a stock option that the  service provider may exercise immediately and receive substantially  vested stock is   not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, even if the stock  option automatically terminates upon the service provider's separation  from service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Enforcement of forfeiture condition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In  determining whether the possibility of forfeiture is substantial in the  case of rights to compensation granted by a service recipient to a  service provider that owns a significant amount of the total combined  voting power or value of all classes of equity of the service recipient  (where the service provider's ownership is determined with application  of the attribution rules under section 318 if the service recipient is a  corporation, or if the service recipient is an entity that is not a  corporation, with application by analogy of the attribution rules under  section 318), all relevant facts and circumstances will be taken into  account in determining whether the probability of the service recipient  enforcing such condition is substantial, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The service provider's relationship to other equity holders and  the extent of their control, potential control and possible loss of  control of the service recipient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The position of the service provider in the service recipient  and the extent to which the service provider is subordinate to other  service providers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The service provider's relationship to the officers and  directors of the service recipient (or similar positions with respect to  a noncorporate service recipient);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The person or persons who must approve the service provider's  discharge; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Past actions of the service recipient in enforcing the  restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of  paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A service provider would be considered as having deferred  compensation subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, but for the  fact that the service provider owns 20 percent of the single class of  stock in the transferor corporation. If the remaining 80 percent of the  class of stock is owned by an unrelated individual (or members of such  an individual's family) so that the possibility of the corporation  enforcing a restriction on such rights is substantial, then such rights  are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A service provider would be considered as having deferred  compensation subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, but for the  fact that the service provider, who is president of the corporation,  also owns 4 percent of the voting power of all the stock of a  corporation. If the remaining stock is so diversely held by the public  that the president, in effect, controls the corporation, then the  possibility of the corporation enforcing a restriction on the right to  deferred compensation of the president is not substantial, and such  rights are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, a disability refers to any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment resulting in the service  provider's inability to perform the duties of his or her position or any  substantially similar position, where such impairment can be expected to  result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of  not less than six months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments based upon subjective performance criteria. The term  performance-based compensation includes payments based upon subjective  performance criteria, provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The subjective performance criteria are bona fide and relate to  the performance of the participant service provider, a group of service  providers that includes the participant service provider, or a business  unit for which the participant service provider provides services (which  may include the entire organization); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The determination that any subjective performance criteria have  been met is not made by the participant service provider or a family  member of the participant service provider (as defined in section  267(c)(4) applied as if the family of an individual includes the spouse  of any member of the family), or a person under the effective control of  the participant service provider or such a family member, and no amount  of the compensation of the person making such determination is  effectively controlled in whole or in part by the service provider or  such a family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equity-based compensation. Compensation is performance-based  compensation if it is based solely on an increase in the value of the  service recipient, or a share of stock in the service recipient, after  the date of a grant or award. However, compensation payable for a  service period that is equal to the value of a predetermined number of  shares of stock, and is variable only to the extent that the value of  such shares appreciates or depreciates, generally will not be  performance-based compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  attainment of a prescribed value for the service recipient (or a portion  thereof), or a share of stock in the service recipient, may be used as a  preestablished organizational criterion for purposes of providing  performance-based compensation, provided that the other requirements of  paragraph (e)(1) of this section are satisfied. In addition, an award of  equity-based compensation may constitute performance-based compensation  if entitlement to the compensation is subject to a condition that would  cause the award to otherwise qualify as performance-based compensation,  such as a performance-based vesting condition. A provision that allows a  service provider to defer compensation that would be realized upon the  exercise of a stock right generally constitutes an additional deferral  feature for purposes of the definition of a deferral of compensation  under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Service provider--(1) In general. The term service provider  includes an individual, corporation, subchapter S corporation,  partnership, personal service corporation (as defined in section  269A(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em>, noncorporate entity that would be a personal service  corporation if it were a corporation, qualified personal service  corporation (as defined in section 448(d)(2)), and noncorporate entity  that would be a qualified personal service corporation if it were a  corporation, for any taxable year in which such individual, corporation,  subchapter S corporation, partnership, or other entity accounts for  gross income from the performance of services under the cash receipts  and disbursements method of accounting. The term service provider  generally includes a person who has separated from service (a former  service provider).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Independent contractors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, section 409A does not  apply to an amount deferred under a plan between a service provider and  service recipient with respect to a particular trade or business in  which the service provider participates, including earnings credited to  such deferred amount, if during the service provider's taxable year in  which the service provider obtains a legally binding right to the  payment of the amount deferred each of the following applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The service provider is actively engaged in the trade or  business of providing services, other than as an employee or as a member  of the board of directors of a corporation (or similar position with  respect to an entity that is not a corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The service provider provides significant services to two or  more service recipients to which the service provider is not related and  that are not related to one another (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)  of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The service provider is not related to the service recipient,  applying the definition of related person contained in paragraph  (f)(2)(ii) of this section subject to the modification that the language  ``20 percent'' is not used instead of ``50 percent'' each place ``50  percent'' appears in sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Related person. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a person  is related to another person if the persons bear a relationship to each  other that is specified in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), subject to the  modifications that the language ``20 percent'' is used instead of ``50  percent'' each place it appears in sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), and  section 267(c)(4) is applied as if the family of an individual includes  the spouse of any member of the family; or the persons are engaged in  trades or businesses under common control (within the meaning of section  52(a) and (b)). In addition, an individual is related to an entity if  the individual is an officer of an entity that is a corporation, or  holds a position substantially similar to an officer of a corporation  with an entity that is not a corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Significant services. Whether a service provider is providing  significant services depends on the facts and circumstances of each  case. However, for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, a  service provider who provides services to two or more service recipients  to which the service provider is not related and that are not related to  one another is deemed to be providing significant services to two or  more of such service recipients for a given taxable year, if the  revenues generated from the services provided to any service recipient  or group of related service recipients during such taxable year do not  exceed 70 percent of the total revenue generated by the service provider  from the trade or business of providing such services. In addition, in  the case of a service provider who has been providing services in a  trade or business for a period of not less than three consecutive years,  for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, a service provider  who provides services to two or more service recipients to which the  service provider is not related and that are not related to one another  is deemed to be providing significant services to two or more of such  service recipients for a given taxable year if in each of the prior  three taxable years the revenues generated from the services provided to  any service recipient or group of related service recipients during such  prior taxable years did not exceed 70 percent of the total revenue  generated by the service provider from the trade or business of  providing such services and, at the time an amount is deferred, the  service provider does not know or have reason to anticipate that the  revenues generated from the services provided to any service recipient  or group of related service recipients during the current year will  exceed 70 percent of the total revenue generated by the service provider  from the trade or business of providing such services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the term management services means services that involve the  actual or de facto direction   or control of the financial or operational aspects of a trade or  business of the service recipient, or investment management or advisory  services provided to a service recipient whose primary trade or business  includes the investment of financial assets (including investments in  real estate), such as a hedge fund or a real estate investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Services provided to related persons. Section 409A does not  apply to an amount deferred under a plan that is a bona fide agreement,  method, program, or other arrangement between a service provider and a  related service recipient arising in the ordinary course of a particular  trade or business in which the service provider is engaged to the extent  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The service provider provides services to the service recipient  as an independent contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> During the service provider's taxable year in which the amount  is deferred, the service provider qualifies for the safe harbor provided  in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section with respect to such trade or  business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Such agreement, method, program, or other arrangement and the  practices thereunder (including billing and collection practices), are  substantially similar to the agreements, methods, programs, or other  arrangements and practices applicable to one or more unrelated service  recipients to whom the service provider provides substantial services  and that produce a majority of the total revenue that the service  provider earns from the trade or business of providing such services  during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Service recipient. Except as otherwise specifically provided in  these regulations, the term service recipient means the person for whom  the services are performed and with respect to whom the legally binding  right to compensation arises, and all persons with whom such person  would be considered a single employer under section 414(b) (employees of  controlled group of corporations), and all persons with whom such person  would be considered a single employer under section 414(c) (employees of  partnerships, proprietorships, etc., under common control). For example,  if the service provider is an employee, the service recipient generally  is the employer (including all persons treated as a single employer  under section 414(b) or (c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, section  409A applies to a plan that provides for the deferral of compensation,  even if the payment of the compensation is not made by the person for  whom services are performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Separation from service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An  employee separates from service with the employer if the employee dies,  retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment with the employer.  However, for purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), the employment  relationship is treated as continuing intact while the individual is on  military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the  period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long  as the individual retains a right to reemployment with the service  recipient under an applicable statute or by contract. For purposes of  this paragraph (h)(1), a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave  of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the employee  will return to perform services for the employer. If the period of leave  exceeds six months and the individual does not retain a right to  reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment  relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately  following such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a  leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental  impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to  last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such  impairment causes the employee to be unable to perform the duties of his  or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of  employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such  six-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (including for purposes of determining the  applicable 36-month (or shorter) period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Independent contractors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An independent  contractor is considered to have a separation from service with the  service recipient upon the expiration of the contract (or in the case of  more than one contract, all contracts) under which services are  performed for the service recipient if the expiration constitutes a  good-faith and complete termination of the contractual relationship. An  expiration does not constitute a good faith and complete termination of  the contractual relationship if the service recipient anticipates a  renewal of a contractual relationship or the independent contractor  becoming an employee. For this purpose, a service recipient is  considered to anticipate the renewal of the contractual relationship  with an independent contractor if it intends to contract again for the  services provided under the expired contract, and neither the service  recipient nor the independent contractor has eliminated the independent  contractor as a possible provider of services under any such new  contract. Further, a service recipient is considered to intend to  contract again for the services provided under an expired contract if  the service recipient's doing so is conditioned only upon incurring a  need for the services, the availability of funds, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this  section, a plan is considered to satisfy the requirement described in  Sec. 1.409A-3(a)(1) with respect to an amount payable upon a separation  from service if, with respect to amounts payable to a service provider  who is an independent contractor, the plan provides that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No amount will be paid to the service provider before a date at  least 12 months after the day on which the contract expires under which  the service provider performs services for the service recipient (or, in  the case of more than one contract, all such contracts expire); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No amount payable to the service provider on that date will be  paid to the service provider if, after the expiration of the contract  (or contracts) and before that date, the service provider performs  services for the service recipient as an independent contractor or an  employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> (the 50 percent standard) is used, the  plan must designate in writing the alternate definition no later than  the last date at which the time and form of payment of the applicable  amount deferred must be elected in accordance with Sec. 1.409A-2(a),  and any change in the definition for such amounts deferred will  constitute a change in the time and form of payment subject to the rules  governing subsequent deferral elections under Sec. 1.409A-2(b) and the  acceleration of payments under Sec. 1.409A-3(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, whether a service recipient is related to another  service recipient is determined under the rules provided in paragraph  (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dual status. If a service provider provides services both as an  employee of a service recipient and as an independent contractor of a  service recipient, the service provider must separate from service both  as an employee and as an independent contractor to be treated as having  separated from service. If a service provider ceases providing services  as an independent contractor and begins providing services as an  employee, or ceases providing services as an employee and begins  providing services as an independent contractor, the service provider  will not be considered to have a separation from service until the  service provider has ceased providing services in both capacities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a service provider provides services  both as an employee of a service recipient and a member of the board of  directors of a corporate service recipient (or an analogous position  with respect to a non-corporate service recipient), the services  provided as a director are not taken into account in determining whether  the service provider has a separation from service as an employee for  purposes of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which the  service provider participates as an employee that is not aggregated with  any plan in which the service provider participates as a director under  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. In addition, if a service provider  provides services both as an employee of a service recipient and a  member of the   board of directors of a corporate service recipient (or an analogous  position with respect to a non-corporate service recipient), the  services provided as an employee are not taken into account in  determining whether the service provider has a separation from service  as a director for purposes of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  in which the service provider participates as a director that is not  aggregated with any plan in which the service provider participates as  an employee under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> applies only if the  definition of separation from service provided by the collective  bargaining agreement was the subject of arm's length negotiations  between employee representatives and two or more employers, the  agreement between employee representatives and such employers satisfies  section 7701(a)(46), and the circumstances surrounding the agreement  evidence good faith bargaining between adverse parties over such  definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) (applied in accordance with the  regulations thereunder and disregarding section 416(i)(5)) at any time  during the 12-month period ending on a specified employee identification  date. If a service provider is a key employee as of a specified employee  identification date, the service provider is treated as a key employee  for purposes of this paragraph (i) for the entire 12-month period  beginning on the specified employee effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of compensation. For purposes of identifying a  specified employee by applying the requirements of section  416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii), and (iii), the definition of compensation under  Sec. 1.415(c)-2(a) is used, applied as if the service recipient were  not using any safe harbor provided in Sec. 1.415(c)-2(d), were not  using any of the elective special timing rules provided in Sec.  1.415(c)-2(e), and were not using any of the elective special rules  provided in Sec. 1.415(c)-2(g). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  service recipient may elect to use any available definition of  compensation under section 415 and the regulations thereunder in  accordance with the election requirements set forth in paragraph (i)(8)  of this section, including any available safe harbor and any available  election under the timing rules or special rules, provided that the  definition is applied consistently to all employees of the service  recipient for purposes of identifying specified employees. A service  recipient may elect to use such an alternative definition regardless of  whether another definition of compensation is being used for purposes of  a qualified plan sponsored by the service recipient. However, once a  list of specified employees has become effective, the service recipient  cannot change the definition of compensation for purposes of identifying  specified employees for the period with respect to which such list is  effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternative methods of satisfying the six-month delay rule. A  plan may provide, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph  (i)(8) of this section, for an alternative method to identify service  providers who will be subject to the six-month delay rule provided in  section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), provided that the alternative method is  reasonably designed to include all specified employees (determined  without respect to any available service recipient elections), the  alternative method is an objectively determinable standard providing no  direct or indirect election to any service provider regarding its  application, and the alternative method results in either all service  providers or no more than 200 service providers being identified in the  class as of any date. Use of such an alternative method will not be  treated as a change in the time and form of payment for purposes of  Sec. 1.409A-2(b) (the subsequent deferral rules), even if the service  provider is not a specified employee when the payment is delayed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Corporate transactions--(i) Mergers and acquisitions of public  service recipients. If as a result of a corporate transaction, two or  more separate service recipients, more than one of which has stock  outstanding that is publicly traded on an established securities market  or otherwise immediately before the transaction, become one service  recipient, any stock of which is publicly traded on an established  securities market or otherwise immediately after the transaction  (resulting public service recipient), the resulting public service  recipient's next specified employee identification date and specified  employee effective date following the corporate transaction are the  specified employee identification date and specified employee effective  date that   the acquiring service recipient would have been required to use absent  such transaction. For this purpose, in the case of a corporate merger,  the acquiring service recipient is the service recipient that included  the surviving corporation in such merger, in the case of an acquisition  by a corporation of the stock of another corporation, the acquiring  service recipient is the service recipient that included the corporation  that acquired such stock, and in all other cases, the surviving service  recipient is determined on the basis of all of the facts and  circumstances. For the period between the transaction and the next  specified employee effective date, the list of specified employees of  the resulting public service recipient is determined by combining the  lists of specified employees of all service recipients participating in  the transaction that were in effect at the date of the corporate  transaction, ranking such specified employees in order of the amount of  compensation used to determine each specified employee's status as a  specified employee, and treating the top 50 of such specified employees,  plus any employees described in section 416(i)(1)(ii) or section  416(i)(1)(iii) and the regulations thereunder (relating to 1-percent and  5-percent owners) who are not included in such top 50 specified  employees, as specified employees for the period between the corporate  transaction and the next specified employee effective date.  Alternatively, the resulting service recipient may elect in accordance  with the requirements of paragraph (i)(8) of this section to use any  reasonable method to determine the specified employees of the resulting  service recipient, including the use of an alternative method of  compliance described in paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(5)</em> of this section, provided that  such method is adopted no later than 90 days after the corporate  transaction and applied prospectively from the date the method is  adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mergers and acquisitions of nonpublic service recipients. If as  part of a corporate transaction a service recipient that does not have  outstanding stock that is publicly traded on an established securities  market or otherwise immediately before the transaction (initial private  service recipient), and a service recipient with stock outstanding that  is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise  immediately before the transaction (initial public service recipient),  become a single service recipient having stock that is publicly traded  on an established securities market or otherwise immediately after the  transaction (resulting public service recipient), the resulting public  service recipient's next specified employee identification date and  specified employee effective date following the corporate transaction  are the specified employee identification date and specified employee  effective date that the initial public service recipient would have been  required to use absent such transaction. For the period after the date  of the corporate transaction and before the next specified employee  effective date, the specified employees of the initial public service  recipient immediately before the transaction continue to be the  specified employees of the resulting public service recipient, and no  service providers of the initial private service recipient are required  to be treated as specified employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Spinoffs. If as part of a corporate transaction, a service  recipient with stock outstanding that is publicly traded on an  established securities market or otherwise immediately before the  transaction (initial public service recipient), becomes two or more  separate service recipients, each with stock outstanding that is  publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise  immediately after the transaction (post-transaction public service  recipients), the next specified employee identification date of each of  the post-transaction public service recipients is the specified employee  identification date that the initial public service recipient would have  been required to use absent such transaction. For the period after the  date of the corporate transaction and before the next specified employee  effective date, the specified employees of the initial public service  recipient immediately before the transaction continue to be the  specified employees of the post-transaction public service recipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Public offerings and other corporate transactions. If as part  of an initial public offering or corporate transaction not described in  paragraph (i)(6)(ii) or (iii) of this section, a service recipient with  no outstanding stock that is publicly traded on an established  securities market or otherwise immediately before such offering or other  transaction (initial private service recipient), becomes one or more  service recipients with stock outstanding that is publicly traded on an  established securities market or otherwise immediately after such  offering or other transaction (post-transaction public service  recipient), each post-transaction public service recipient has a  specified employee identification date of December 31 and a specified  employee effective date of April 1, effective retroactively to the  December 31 and April 1 next preceding the offering or other transaction  for purposes of identifying the specified employees between the  corporation transaction and the next December 31. Alternatively, a post- transaction public service recipient may elect in accordance with the  requirements of paragraph (i)(8) of this section, a specified employee  identification date and specified employee effective date on or before  the date of the offering or other transaction. If a public service  recipient makes such an election, for the period after the offering or  other transaction and before the next specified employee effective date,  the specified employees of the post-transaction public service recipient  consist of the service providers that at the time of the offering or  other transaction would have been classified as specified employees of  the initial private service recipient, had the initial private service  recipient elected the same specified employee identification date and  specified employee effective date as selected by the post-transaction  public service recipient, and had such initial private service recipient  had stock publicly traded on an established securities market or  otherwise as of the specified employee identification date preceding the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Alternative methods of compliance. For purposes of this  paragraph (i)(6), references to specified employees as of a corporate  transaction or offering include any specified employees identified  through the use of an alternative method described in paragraph (i)(5)  of this section, where the use of such alternative method was  established and effective at the time of the corporate transaction or  offering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Nonresident alien employees. For purposes of determining whether  an employee meets the requirements of section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii), or  (iii) (applied in accordance with the regulations thereunder and  disregarding section 416(i)(5)), and therefore is a key employee, the  incorporation of the rules of Sec. 1.415(c)-2(g)(5) regarding the  definition of compensation applies. Accordingly, the rule of Sec.  1.415(c)-2(g)(5)(i), generally requiring the treatment as compensation  of certain compensation excludible from an employee's gross income due  to the location of the services or the identity of the employer,  applies. In addition, a service recipient may elect in accordance with  paragraph (i)(8) of this section to apply the rule of Sec. 1.415(c)- 2(g)(5)(ii) to not treat as compensation certain compensation excludible  from an employee's gross income on account of the location of the  services or the identity of the employer that is not effectively  connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United  States. A service recipient may elect to apply the rule of Sec. 1.415- 2(g)(5)(ii) regardless of whether the service recipient has elected to  apply the rule to a qualified plan sponsored by the service recipient;  however, once a list of specified employees has become effective, any  election of the rule for that period may not be changed. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, any election of the rule made before January 1, 2008, may  be effective with respect to any specified employee identification date  on or before December 31, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Elections affecting the identification of specified employees.  The elections described in paragraphs (i)(2) through (7) of this section  are effective only as of the date that all necessary corporate action  has been taken to make such elections binding for purposes of all  affected nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which the service  providers of the service recipient that would become a specified  employee due   to the application of such election participate. Where a taxpayer  attempts to make an election under paragraph (i)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6),  or (7) of this section but such election is not binding on all the  affected nonqualified deferred compensation plans and applied  consistently to all such service providers, the election is not  effective and the rule under paragraph (i)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or  (7) of this section, as applicable, that would apply absent an election  is applicable for identifying specified employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Nonresident alien. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of  this section, the term nonresident alien means an individual who is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A nonresident alien within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(B);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A dual resident taxpayer within the meaning of Sec.  301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this chapter with respect to any taxable year in  which such individual is treated as a nonresident alien for purposes of  computing the individual's U.S. income tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term nonresident alien does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A nonresident alien with respect to whom an election is in  effect for the taxable year under section 6013(g) to be treated as a  resident of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A former citizen or long-term resident (within the meaning of  section 877(e)(2)) who expatriated after June 3, 2004, and has not  complied with the requirements of section 7701(n); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the  United States for the taxable year under section 877(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Established securities market.

The term separation pay means any  deferral of compensation (before the application of the exclusions from  the definition of a deferral of compensation set forth in paragraph  (b)(9) of this section) that will not be paid under any circumstances  unless the service provider has had a separation from service, whether  voluntary or involuntary, including payments in the form of  reimbursements of expenses incurred, and the provision of in-kind  benefits. A deferral of compensation that the service provider may  receive without a separation from service does not become separation pay  merely because the service provider elects to receive or receives the  payment after or upon a separation from service. A deferral of  compensation does not fail to be separation pay merely because the  payment is conditioned upon the execution of a release of claims,  noncompetition or nondisclosure provisions, or other similar  requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount, or entitlement  to any amount, that acts as a substitute for, or replacement of, amounts  deferred by the service recipient under a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan constitutes a payment of compensation or deferral of  compensation under such nonqualified deferred compensation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Involuntary separation from service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An  involuntary separation from service means a separation from service due  to the independent exercise of the unilateral authority of the service  recipient to terminate the service provider's services, other than due  to the service provider's implicit or explicit request, where the  service provider was willing and able to continue performing services.  An involuntary separation from service may include the service  recipient's failure to renew a contract at the time such contract  expires, provided that the service provider was willing and able to  execute a new contract providing terms and conditions substantially  similar to those in the expiring contract and to continue providing such  services. The determination of whether a separation from service is  involuntary is based on all the facts and circumstances. Any   characterization of the separation from service as voluntary or  involuntary by the service provider and the service recipient in the  documentation of the separation from service is presumed to properly  characterize the nature of the separation from service. However, the  presumption may be rebutted where the facts and circumstances indicate  otherwise. For example, if a separation from service is designated as a  voluntary separation from service or resignation, but the facts and  circumstances indicate that absent such voluntary separation from  service the service recipient would have terminated the service  provider's services, and that the service provider had knowledge that  the service provider would be so terminated, the separation from service  is involuntary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separations from service for good reason--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Notwithstanding paragraph (n)(1) of this section, a service provider's  voluntary separation from service will be treated for purposes of this  section and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6 as an involuntary  separation from service if the separation from service occurs under  certain limited bona fide conditions, where the avoidance of the  requirements of section 409A is not a purpose of the inclusion of these  conditions in the plan or of the actions by the service recipient in  connection with the satisfaction of these conditions, and a voluntary  separation from service under such conditions effectively constitutes an  involuntary separation from service. Generally such conditions will be  prespecified under an agreement to provide compensation upon a  separation from service for good reason. Such a good reason (or a  similar condition) must be defined to require actions taken by the  service recipient resulting in a material negative change to the service  provider in the service relationship, such as the duties to be  performed, the conditions under which such duties are to be performed,  or the compensation to be received for performing such services. Other  factors taken into account in determining whether a separation from  service for good reason effectively constitutes an involuntary  separation from service include the extent to which the payments upon a  separation from service for good reason are in the same amount and are  to be made at the same time and in the same form as payments available  upon an actual involuntary separation from service, and whether the  service provider is required to give the service recipient notice of the  existence of the condition that would result in treatment as a  separation from service for good reason and a reasonable opportunity to  remedy the condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6, if a plan provides that a voluntary  separation from service will be treated as an involuntary separation  from service if the separation from service occurs under certain express  conditions, a separation from service satisfying the conditions set  forth in the plan will be treated as an involuntary separation from the  service if the necessary conditions (or set of conditions) require the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The separation from service must occur during a pre-determined  limited period of time not to exceed two years following the initial  existence of one or more of the following conditions arising without the  consent of the service provider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A material diminution in the service provider's base  compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A material diminution in the service provider's authority,  duties, or responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A material diminution in the authority, duties, or  responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the service provider is  required to report, including a requirement that a service provider  report to a corporate officer or employee instead of reporting directly  to the board of directors of a corporation (or similar governing body  with respect to an entity other than a corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A material diminution in the budget over which the service  provider retains authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A material change in the geographic location at which the  service provider must perform the services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach  by the service recipient of the agreement under which the service  provider provides services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount, time, and form of payment upon the separation from  service must be substantially identical to the amount, time and form of  payment payable due to an actual involuntary separation from service, to  the extent such a right exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The service provider must be required to provide notice to the  service recipient of the existence of the condition described in  paragraph (n)(2)(ii)(A) of this section within a period not to exceed 90  days of the initial existence of the condition, upon the notice of which  the service recipient must be provided a period of at least 30 days  during which it may remedy the condition and not be required to pay the  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain collectively bargained plans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this paragraph (n), to  the extent a plan is subject to a bona fide collective bargaining  agreement covering services performed for multiple employers under which  an employee must separate from service with all such employers in order  to receive a payment, such plan may use any reasonable definition of  involuntary separation from service, provided that such definition is  consistent with any definition of a separation from service adopted  under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and provided further that the  definition of an involuntary separation from service provided by the  collective bargaining agreement was the subject of arm's length  negotiations between employee representatives and two or more employers,  the agreement between employee representatives and such employers  satisfies section 7701(a)(46), and the circumstances surrounding the  agreement evidence good faith bargaining between adverse parties over  such definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Earnings. Whether a deferred amount constitutes earnings on an  amount deferred, or actual or notional income attributable to an amount  deferred, is determined under the principles defining income  attributable to the amount taken into account under Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)- 1(d)(2) of this chapter. Accordingly, with respect to an account balance  plan, earnings on an amount deferred generally include an amount  credited on behalf of a service provider under the terms of the plan  that reflects a rate of return that does not exceed either the rate of  return on a predetermined actual investment or, if the income does not  reflect the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment, a  reasonable rate of interest. With respect to nonaccount balance plans,  earnings on an amount deferred generally include an increase, due solely  to the passage of time, in the present value of the future payments to  which the service provider has obtained a legally binding right, the  present value of which constituted the amount deferred (determined as of  the date such amount was deferred), but only if the amount deferred was  determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods. A right  to earnings on an amount deferred generally is treated as a right to a  deferral of compensation for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6. However, for purposes of any provision of  this section and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6 referring to  earnings on deferred compensation (or similar terms), the use of an  unreasonable rate of return, or unreasonable actuarial assumptions and  methods, generally will result in the treatment of some or all of such a  right to deferred compensation as a right only to deferred compensation,  and not a right to earnings on deferred compensation, so that the  provision will not be applicable. With respect to plans that are neither  account balance plans nor nonaccount balance plans, these rules apply by  analogy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> In-kind benefits. The term in-kind benefits refers to services  provided to or on behalf of a service provider, such as financial  planning services, or tangible personal or real property made available  for use by or on behalf of the service provider, such as the use of an  aircraft or vehicle, and does not refer to a transfer of property within  the meaning of section 83 and the regulations thereunder, or a promise  to transfer, or an option to purchase or receive, property in the  future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Application of definitions and rules. The definitions and rules  set forth in paragraphs (a) through (p) of this section apply for  purposes of section 409A,   this section, and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6.  [T.D. 9321, 72 FR 19276, Apr. 17, 2007; 72 FR 41620, July 31, 2007]    Sec. 1.409A-2  Deferral elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial elections as to the time and form of payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. A plan that is, or constitutes part of, a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan meets the requirements of section 409A(a)(4)(B) only  if under the terms of the plan, compensation for services performed  during a service provider's taxable year (the service year) may be  deferred at the service provider's election only if the election to  defer such compensation is made and becomes irrevocable not later than  the latest date permitted in this paragraph (a). An election will not be  considered to be revocable merely because the service provider or  service recipient may make an election to change the time and form of  payment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or the service  recipient may accelerate the time of payment pursuant to Sec. 1.409A- 3(j)(4) (exceptions to prohibition on accelerated payments). Whether a  plan provides a service provider an opportunity to elect the time or  form of payment of compensation is determined based upon all the facts  and circumstances surrounding the determination of the time and form of  payment of the compensation. For purposes of this section, an election  to defer includes an election as to the time of the payment, an election  as to the form of the payment or an election as to both the time and the  form of the payment, but does not include an election as to the medium  of payment (for example, an election between a payment of cash or a  payment of property). Except as otherwise expressly provided in this  section, an election will not be considered made until such election  becomes irrevocable under the terms of the applicable plan. Accordingly,  a plan may provide that an election to defer may be changed at any time  before the last permissible date for making such an election. Where a  plan provides the service provider a right to make an initial deferral  election, and further provides that the election remains in effect until  terminated or modified by the service provider, the election will be  treated as made as of the date such election becomes irrevocable as to  compensation for services performed during the relevant service year.  For example, where a plan provides that a service provider's election to  defer a set percentage will remain in effect until changed or revoked,  but that as of each December 31 the election becomes irrevocable with  respect to salary payable in connection with services performed in the  immediately following year, the initial deferral election with respect  to salary payable with respect to services performed in the immediately  following year will be deemed to have been made as of the December 31  upon which the election became irrevocable. For purposes of this  paragraph (a), the reference to a service period or a performance period  refers to the period of service for which the right to the compensation  arises, and may include periods before the grant of a legally binding  right to the compensation. For example, where a service recipient grants  a bonus based upon services performed in the calendar year 2010, but  retains the discretion to rescind the bonus until 2011 such that the  promise of the bonus is not a legally binding right, the period of  service or performance period to which the compensation relates is the  calendar year 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Service recipient elections. A plan that provides for a deferral  of compensation for services performed during a service provider's  taxable year that does not provide the service provider with an  opportunity to elect the time or form of payment of such compensation  must designate the time and form of payment by no later than the later  of the time the service provider first has a legally binding right to  the compensation or, if later, the time the service provider would be  required under this section to make such an election if the service  provider were provided such an election. Such designation is treated as  an initial deferral election for purposes of this section. Where a plan  permits a service recipient to exercise discretion to disregard a  service provider election as to the time or form of a payment, any  service provider election that is subject to such discretion will be  treated   as revocable so long as such discretion may be exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> General rule. A plan that is, or constitutes part of, a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan meets the requirements of  section 409A(a)(4)(B) if under the terms of the plan, compensation for  services performed during a service provider's taxable year (the service  year) may be deferred at the service provider's election only if the  election to defer such compensation is made not later than the close of  the service provider's taxable year next preceding the service year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, an election to defer such compensation may be  made in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section, applied as if the amount were a deferral of compensation and  the scheduled payment date for the amount were the date the substantial  risk of forfeiture lapses. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph  (b) of this section, such a deferral election may provide that the  deferred amounts will be payable upon a change in control event (as  defined in Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(5)) without regard to the five-year  additional deferral requirement in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>, the term fiscal year compensation  means compensation relating to a period of service coextensive with one  or more consecutive taxable years of the service recipient, of which no  amount is paid or payable during the service recipient's taxable year or  years constituting the period of service. For example, fiscal year  compensation generally would include a bonus to an individual employee  with a calendar year taxable year that is based on a service period  consisting of the service recipient's two consecutive taxable years  ending September 30, 2011, where the amount will be paid after the end  of the second of such taxable years, but would not include either a  bonus based on a service period consisting of one or more calendar years  or salary that would otherwise be paid during such taxable years of the  service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> First year of eligibility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of the  first year in which a service provider becomes eligible to participate  in a plan, the service provider may make an initial deferral election  within 30 days after the date   the service provider becomes eligible to participate in such plan, with  respect to compensation paid for services to be performed after the  election. In the case of a plan that does not provide for service  provider elections with respect to the time or form of a payment, the  time and form of the payment must be specified on or before the date  that is 30 days after the date the service provider first becomes  eligible to participate in such plan. For compensation that is earned  based upon a specified performance period (for example, an annual  bonus), where a deferral election is made in the first year of  eligibility but after the beginning of the performance period, the  election must apply only to the compensation paid for services performed  after the election. For this purpose, an election will be deemed to  apply to compensation paid for services performed after the election if  the election applies to no more than an amount equal to the total amount  of the compensation for the performance period multiplied by the ratio  of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the  election over the total number of days in the performance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility to participate. For purposes of this paragraph  (a)(7), a service provider is eligible to participate in a plan at any  time during which, under the plan's terms and without further amendment  or action by the service recipient, the service provider is eligible to  accrue an amount of deferred compensation under the plan other than  earnings on amounts previously deferred, even if the service provider  has elected not to accrue (or has not elected to accrue) an amount of  deferred compensation. Where a service provider has been paid all  amounts deferred under a plan, and on and before the date of the last  payment was not eligible to continue (or to elect to continue) to  participate in the plan for periods after the last payment (other than  through an election of a different time and form of payment with respect  to the amounts paid), the service provider may be treated as initially  eligible to participate in a plan as of the first date following such  payment that the service provider becomes eligible to accrue an  additional amount of deferred compensation. Where a service provider has  ceased being eligible to participate in a plan (other than the accrual  of earnings), regardless of whether all amounts deferred under the plan  have been paid, and subsequently becomes eligible to participate in the  plan again, the service provider may be treated as being initially  eligible to participate in the plan if the service provider had not been  eligible to participate in the plan (other than the accrual of earnings)  at any time during the 24-month period ending on the date the service  provider again becomes eligible to participate in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application to excess benefit plans. For purposes of this  paragraph (a)(7), a service provider is treated as initially eligible to  participate in an excess benefit plan as of the first day of the service  provider's taxable year immediately following the first year the service  provider accrues a benefit under the excess benefit plan; and any  election made within 30 days following such date is treated as applying  to benefits accrued under such plan for services performed before the  election. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(7), the term excess benefit  plan means all nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which a  service provider participates, to the extent such plans do not provide  for an election between current compensation (including a short-term  deferral) and deferred compensation and solely provide deferred  compensation equal to the excess of the benefits the service provider  would have accrued under a qualified employer plan (as defined in Sec.  1.409A-1(a)(2)) in which the service provider also participates, in the  absence of one or more of the limits incorporated into the plan to  reflect one or more of the limits on contributions or benefits  applicable to the qualified employer plan under the Internal Revenue  Code, over the benefits the service provider actually accrues under the  qualified employer plan. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(7), once a  service provider has accrued a benefit or deferred compensation under a  plan in any year, the service provider will not become eligible for an  initial deferral election based upon an accrual or deferral under an  excess benefit plan in a subsequent year, even if the benefit   or deferred compensation accrued in a previous year is forfeited or  eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em>, if the performance-based compensation is a specified  or calculable amount, the compensation is readily ascertainable if and  when the amount is first substantially certain to be paid. If the  performance-based compensation is not a specified or calculable amount  because, for example, the amount may vary based upon the level of  performance, the compensation, or any portion of the compensation, is  readily ascertainable when the amount is first both calculable and  substantially certain to be paid. For this purpose, the performance- based compensation is bifurcated between the portion that is readily  ascertainable and the amount that is not readily ascertainable.  Accordingly, in general any minimum amount that is both calculable and  substantially certain to be paid will be treated as readily  ascertainable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)(i)</em> or (ii), the change in the amount deferred under  the nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not exceed the change  in the amounts deferred under the qualified employer plan or the broad- based foreign retirement plan, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under the qualified  employer plan or broad-based foreign retirement plan with respect to  whether to elect to receive a subsidized benefit or an ancillary benefit  under the qualified employer plan or broad-based foreign retirement  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amendment of a qualified employer plan or broad-based  foreign retirement plan to add or remove a subsidized benefit or an  ancillary benefit, or to freeze or limit future accruals of benefits  under the qualified plan or freeze or limit future accruals of benefits  or reduce existing benefits under the broad-based foreign retirement  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under a qualified  employer plan with respect to elective deferrals and other employee pre- tax contributions subject to the contribution restrictions under section  401(a)(30) or section 402(g), including an adjustment to a deferral  election under such qualified employer plan, provided that for any given  taxable year, the service provider's action or inaction does not result  in an increase in the amounts deferred under all nonqualified deferred  compensation plans in which the service provider participates (other  than amounts described in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section) in  excess of the limit with respect to elective deferrals under section  402(g)(1)(A), (B), and (C) in effect for the taxable year in which such  action or inaction occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under a qualified  employer plan with respect to elective deferrals and other employee pre- tax contributions subject to the contribution restrictions under section  401(a)(30) or section 402(g), and after-tax contributions by the service  provider to a qualified employer plan that provides for such  contributions, that affects the amounts that are credited under one or  more nonqualified deferred compensation plans as matching amounts or  other similar amounts contingent on such elective deferrals, employee  pre-tax contributions, or after-tax contributions, provided that the  total of such matching or contingent amounts, as applicable, never  exceeds 100 percent of the matching or contingent amounts that would be  provided under the qualified employer plan absent any plan-based  restrictions that reflect limits on qualified plan contributions under  the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Changes in elections under a cafeteria plan. A change in an  election under a cafeteria plan does not constitute a deferral election  with respect to an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan to the extent that the change in the amount deferred  under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan results solely from  the application of the change in amount eligible to be treated as  compensation under the terms of the nonqualified deferred compensation  plan resulting from the election change under the cafeteria plan, to a  benefit formula under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based  upon the service provider's eligible compensation, and only to the  extent that such change applies in the same manner as any other increase  or decrease in compensation would apply to such benefit formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> does not apply to any separation pay to which the service  provider obtained a legally binding right before the negotiations at the  time of the separation from service, including a right to a payment  subject to a condition such as that the service provider separate from  service other than for cause. In the case of separation pay due to  participation in a window program (as defined in Sec. 1.409A- 1(b)(9)(vi)), an initial deferral election may be made at any time  before the time the election to participate in the window program  becomes irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Initial deferral election with respect to certain commissions-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sales commission compensation. For purposes of this paragraph (a), a  service provider earning sales commission compensation is treated as  providing the services to   which such compensation relates only in the service provider's taxable  year in which the customer remits payment to the service recipient or,  if applied consistently to all similarly situated service providers, the  service provider's taxable year in which the sale occurs. For purposes  of this paragraph (a)(12), the term sales commission compensation means  compensation or portions of compensation earned by a service provider if  a substantial portion of the services provided by such service provider  to a service recipient consist of the direct sale of a product or  service to an unrelated customer, the compensation paid by the service  recipient to the service provider consists of either a portion of the  purchase price for the product or service or an amount substantially all  of which is calculated by reference to the volume of sales, and payment  of the compensation is either contingent upon the service recipient  receiving payment from an unrelated customer for the product or services  or, if applied consistently to all similarly situated service providers,  is contingent upon the closing of the sales transaction and such other  requirements as may be specified by the service recipient before the  closing of the sales transaction. For this purpose, a customer is  treated as an unrelated customer only if the customer is not related to  either the service provider or the service recipient. A person is  treated as related to another person if the person would be treated as  related to the other person under Sec. 1.409A-1(f)(2)(ii) or the person  would be treated as providing management services to the other person  under Sec. 1.409A-1(f)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or the person would be treated as providing  management services to the other person under Sec. 1.409A-1(f)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commission compensation and related persons. The rules of  paragraphs (a)(12)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to sales commission  compensation and investment commission compensation involving a related  customer, provided that substantial sales from which commission  compensation arises are made, or substantial services from which  commission compensation arises are provided, to unrelated customers by  the service recipient, the sales and service arrangement and the  commission arrangement with respect to the related customer are bona  fide, arise from the service recipient's ordinary course of business,  and are substantially the same, both in terms and in practice, as the  terms and practices applicable to unrelated customers (as defined in  such paragraphs) to which individually or in the aggregate substantial  sales are made or substantial services provided by the service  recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Initial deferral election with respect to compensation paid for  final payroll period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Unless a plan provides otherwise,  compensation payable after the last day of the service provider's  taxable year solely for services performed during the final payroll  period described in section 3401(b) containing the last day of the  service provider's taxable year or, with respect to a non-employee  service provider, a period not longer than the payroll period described  in section 3401(b), where such amount is payable pursuant to the timing  arrangement under which the service recipient normally compensates  service providers for services performed during a payroll period  described in section 3401(b), or with respect to a non-employee service  provider, a period not longer than the payroll period described in  section 3401(b), is treated as compensation for services performed in  the subsequent taxable year in which the payment is made. The preceding  sentence does not apply to any compensation paid during such period for  services performed during any period other than such final payroll  period, such as a payment of an annual bonus.

A plan that permits under a subsequent election a delay in a payment or  a change in the form of payment (a subsequent deferral election),  including a subsequent deferral election made by a service provider or a  service recipient, satisfies the requirements of section 409A(a)(4)(C)  only if the conditions of this paragraph (b) are met. For purposes of  this paragraph (b), except as otherwise expressly provided in this  section, a subsequent deferral election is not considered made until  such election becomes irrevocable under the terms of the plan.  Accordingly, a plan may provide that a subsequent deferral election may  be changed at any time before the last permissible date for making such  a subsequent deferral election. Where a plan permits a subsequent  deferral election, the requirements of this paragraph are satisfied   only if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan requires that such election not take effect until at  least 12 months after the date on which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an election related to a payment not described  in Sec. 1.409A-3(a)(2) (payment on account of disability), Sec.  1.409A-3(a)(3) (payment on account of death), or Sec. 1.409A-3(a)(6)  (payment on account of the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency),  the plan requires that the payment with respect to which such election  is made be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the  date such payment would otherwise have been paid (or in the case of a  life annuity or installment payments treated as a single payment, five  years from the date the first amount was scheduled to be paid).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The plan requires that any election related to a payment  described in Sec. 1.409A-3(a)(4) (payment at a specified time or  pursuant to a fixed schedule) be made not less than 12 months before the  date the payment is scheduled to be paid (or in the case of a life  annuity or installment payments treated as a single payment, 12 months  before the date the first amount was scheduled to be paid).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em> and (iii) of this section, the term payment refers  to each separately identified amount to which a service provider is  entitled to payment under a plan on a determinable date, and includes  amounts applied for the benefit of the service provider. An amount is  separately identified only if the amount may be objectively determined  under a nondiscretionary formula. For example, an amount identified as  10 percent of the account balance as of a specified payment date would  be a separately identified amount.

The entitlement to a life  annuity is treated as the entitlement to a single payment. Accordingly,  an election to delay payment of a life annuity, or to change the form of  payment of a life annuity, must be made at least 12 months before the  scheduled commencement of the life annuity, and must defer the payment  for a period of not less than five years from the originally scheduled  commencement of the life annuity. For purposes of Sec. 1.409A-1, this  section, and Sec. Sec. 1.409A-3 through 1.409A-6, the term life annuity  means a series of substantially equal periodic payments, payable not  less frequently than annually, for the life (or life expectancy) of the  service provider, or a series of substantially equal periodic payments,  payable not less frequently than annually, for the life (or life  expectancy) of the service provider, followed upon the death or end of  the life expectancy of the service provider by a series of substantially  equal periodic payments, payable not less frequently than annually, for  the life (or life expectancy) of the service provider's designated  beneficiary (if any). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a schedule of  payments does not fail to be an annuity solely because such plan  provides for an immediate payment of the actuarial present value of all  remaining annuity payments if the actuarial present value of the  remaining annuity payments falls below a predetermined amount, and the  immediate payment of such amount does not constitute an accelerated  payment for purposes of Sec. 1.409A-3(j), provided that such feature,  including the predetermined amount, is established by no later than the  time and form of payment is otherwise required to be established, and  provided further that any change in such feature, including the  predetermined amount, is a change in the time and form of payment. A  change in designated beneficiary before any annuity payment has been  made under the plan is not a change in the   time or form of payment. A change in the form of a payment before any  annuity payment has been made under the plan, from one type of life  annuity to another type of life annuity with the same scheduled date for  the first annuity payment, is not considered a change in the time and  form of a payment, provided that the annuities are actuarially  equivalent applying reasonable actuarial methods and assumptions. For  purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), a requirement that a service  provider obtain the consent of a spouse or other potential recipient of  a survivor annuity to change a beneficiary or form of payment is  disregarded, so that any annuity form that the service recipient could  elect to receive with such consent is considered currently available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain features disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the following features are  disregarded for purposes of determining whether a payment form is a life  annuity within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), but are not  disregarded for purposes of determining whether a life annuity is the  actuarial equivalent of another life annuity except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Term certain features under which annuity payments continue for  the longer of the life of the annuitant or a fixed period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pop-up features under which payments increase upon the death of  the beneficiary or another event that eliminates the right to a survivor  annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cash refund features under which payment is provided upon the  death of the last annuitant in an amount that is not greater than the  excess of the present value of the annuity at the annuity starting date  over the total of payments before the death of the last annuitant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Features under which an annuity form of payment provides higher  periodic payments before the expected commencement of benefits under the  Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. ch. 7) or the Railroad Retirement Act (45  U.S.C. 231 et seq.) and lower periodic payments after such expected  commencement date, so that the combined periodic payments under the  arrangement and the Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act,  as applicable, are approximately level before and after such expected  commencement date (Social Security or Railroad Retirement leveling  features).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Features providing for an increase in the annuity payment in a  manner described in Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-14;(a)(1) or (2) (eligible  cost-of-living adjustments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Subsidized joint and survivor annuities. For purposes of this  paragraph (b)(2)(ii), a joint and survivor annuity will not fail to be  treated as actuarially equivalent to a single life annuity due solely to  the value of a subsidized survivor annuity benefit, provided that the  annual lifetime annuity benefit available to the service provider under  the joint and survivor annuity is not greater than the annual lifetime  annuity benefit available to the service provider under the single life  annuity alternative, and provided that the annual survivor annuity  benefit is not greater than the annual lifetime annuity benefit  available to the service provider under the joint and survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Actuarial assumptions and methods. For purposes of this  paragraph (b)(2)(ii), at any given time the same actuarial assumptions  and methods must be used in valuing each annuity payment option, in  determining whether the payments are actuarially equivalent and such  assumptions must be reasonable. This requirement applies over the entire  term of the service provider's participation in the plan, such that the  annuity payment must be actuarially equivalent at all times for the  annuity payment options to be treated as one time and form of payment.  There is no requirement that the same actuarial methods and assumptions  be used over the term of a service provider's participation in a plan.  Accordingly, a plan may change the actuarial assumptions and methods  used to determine the life annuity payments provided that all of the  actuarial assumptions and methods are reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Installment payments. The entitlement to a series of  installment payments that is not a life annuity is treated as the  entitlement to a single payment, unless the plan provides at   all times with respect to the amount deferred that the right to the  series of installment payments is to be treated as a right to a series  of separate payments. For purposes of Sec. 1.409A-1, this section, and  Sec. Sec. 1.409A-3 through 1.409A-6, a series of installment payments  refers to an entitlement to the payment of a series of substantially  equal periodic amounts to be paid over a predetermined period of years,  except to the extent any increase (or decrease) in the amount reflects  reasonable earnings (or losses) through the date the amount is paid. For  this purpose, a series of installment payments over a predetermined  period and a series of installment payments over a shorter or longer  period, or a series of installment payments over the same predetermined  period but with a different commencement date, are different times and  forms of payment. Accordingly, a change in the predetermined period or  the commencement date is a change in the time and form of payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a schedule of payments does not fail to  be an installment payment solely because such plan provides for an  immediate payment of all remaining installments if the present value of  the deferred amount to be paid in the remaining installment payments  falls below a predetermined amount, and the immediate payment of such  amount does not constitute an accelerated payment for purposes of Sec.  1.409A-3(j), provided that such feature including the predetermined  amount is established by no later than the time and form of payment is  otherwise required to be established, and provided further that any  change in such feature including the predetermined amount is a change in  the time and form of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transition rule. For purposes of this section, a plan that was  adopted and effective before December 31, 2007, whether written or  unwritten, that fails to make a designation as to whether the  entitlement to a series of payments is to be treated as an entitlement  to a series of separate payments under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this  section, may make such designation on or before December 31, 2007,  provided such designation is set forth in writing on or before December  31, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beneficiaries. The rules of this paragraph (b) governing changes  in the time and form of payment apply to elections by beneficiaries with  respect to the time and form of payment, as well as elections by service  providers or service recipients with respect to the time and form of  payment to beneficiaries. An election to change the identity of a  beneficiary does not constitute a change in the time and form of payment  merely because the election changes the identity of the recipient of the  payment, if the time and form of the payment is not otherwise changed.  In addition, an election to change the identity of a beneficiary before  the initial payment of a life annuity does not constitute a change in  the time and form of payment if the change in the time of payments stems  solely from the different life expectancy of the new beneficiary, such  as in the case of a joint and survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Domestic relations orders. The rules of this paragraph (b)  governing changes in the time and form of payment do not apply to  elections by individuals other than a service provider, with respect to  payments to a person other than the service provider, to the extent such  elections are reflected in, or made in accordance with, the terms of a  domestic relations order (as defined in section 414(p)(1)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coordination with prohibition against acceleration of payments.  For purposes of applying the prohibition against the acceleration of  payments in Sec. 1.409A-3(j), the definition of payment is the same as  the definition in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Accordingly, a  change in the form of a payment that results in a more rapid schedule  for payments generally will not constitute an acceleration of a payment,  if the change in the form of payment is made in compliance with the  subsequent deferral rules. For example, a change in form from a 10-year  installment payment treated as a single payment to a lump-sum payment  would not constitute an acceleration if the change in the form of the  payment is made in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, generally meaning that the election to change to a  lump-sum payment   must be made at least 12 months before the installment payments were  scheduled to commence and the lump-sum payment could not be made until  at least five years after the date the installment payments were  scheduled to commence. See Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(i) with respect to  situations in which the failure to accelerate a payment or the  modification of a plan term relating to certain accelerated payments  will not be subject to the rules of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application to multiple payment events. In the case of a plan  that permits a payment upon each of a number of potential permissible  payment events, such as the earlier of a fixed date or separation from  service, the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are  applied separately to each payment (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section) due upon each payment event. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the addition or deletion of a permissible payment event to a  plan under which amounts were previously deferred is subject to the  rules of this paragraph (b) where the addition or deletion of the  permissible payment event may result in a change in the time or form of  payment of the amount deferred. For application of the rules governing  accelerations of payments to the addition of a permissible payment event  to amounts deferred, see Sec. 1.409A-3(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em>, and the provision will  not fail to meet the requirements of establishing a permissible payment  event and the delay in the payment will not constitute a subsequent  deferral election, so long as the service recipient treats all payments  to similarly situated service providers on a reasonably consistent  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments that would violate Federal securities laws or other  applicable law. A payment may be delayed where the service recipient  reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate  Federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided that the  payment is made at the earliest date at which the service recipient  reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause  such violation. The making of a payment that would cause inclusion in  gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other  provision of the Internal Revenue   Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other events and conditions. A service recipient may delay a  payment upon such other events and conditions as the Commissioner may  prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). For  additional rules applicable to certain delayed payments pursuant to a  change in control event, see Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv). For additional  rules applicable to amounts payable because of an unforeseeable  emergency, see Sec. 1.409A-3(i)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> USERRA rights. The requirements of this paragraph (b) are deemed  met to the extent an election to change the time or form of a payment of  deferred compensation is provided to satisfy the requirements of the  Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as  amended, 38 U.S.C. 4301-4344.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  the provisions of this section. For purposes of these examples, each  employee is an individual with a calendar year taxable year, and is  employed by the specified employer:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Initial election to defer salary. Employer ZZ sponsors a  plan under which Employee A may elect to defer a percentage of Employee  A's salary. Employee A has participated in the plan in prior years. To  satisfy the requirements of this section with respect to salary earned  in calendar year 2008, if Employee A elects to defer any amount of such  salary, the deferral election (including an election as to the time and  form of payment) must be made no later than December 31, 2007.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Designation of time and form of payment where an initial  deferral election is not provided. Employer YY has a taxable year ending  September 30. On July 1, 2008, Employer YY enters into a legally binding  obligation to pay Employee B a $10,000 bonus. The amount is not subject  to a substantial risk of forfeiture and does not qualify as performance- based compensation as described in Sec. 1.409A-1(e). Employer YY does  not provide Employee B an election as to the time and form of payment.  Unless the amount is to be paid in accordance with the short-term  deferral rule of Sec. 1.409A-1(b)(4), Employer YY must specify the time  and form of payment on or before July 1, 2008, to satisfy the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Initial election to defer bonus payable based on services  during calendar year. Employer XX has a taxable year ending September  30. Employee C participates in a bonus plan under which Employee C is  entitled to a bonus for services performed during the calendar year  that, absent an election by Employee C, will be paid on March 15 of the  following year. The amount is not subject to a substantial risk of  forfeiture and does not qualify as performance-based compensation as  described in Sec. 1.409A-1(e). If Employee C elects to defer the  payment of the bonus with respect to services rendered during calendar  year 2008, Employee C must elect the time and form of payment not later  than December 31, 2007, to satisfy the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Initial election to defer bonus payable based on services  during fiscal year other than calendar year. Employer WW has a taxable  year ending September 30. Employee D participates in a bonus plan under  which Employee D is entitled to a bonus for services performed during  Employer WW's fiscal year that, absent an election by Employee D, will  be paid on December 15 of the calendar year in which the fiscal year  ends. The amount is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and  does not qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Sec.  1.409A-1(e). The amount qualifies as fiscal year compensation. If  Employee D elects to defer the payment of the amount related to the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, to satisfy the requirements of  this section Employee D must elect the time and form of payment not  later than September 30, 2008.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Initial election to defer bonus payable only if service  provider completes at least 12 months of services after the election.  Employer VV has a calendar year taxable year. On March 1, 2008, Employer  VV grants Employee E a $10,000 bonus, payable on March 1, 2010 (with  reasonable interest), provided that Employee E continues performing  services as an employee of Employer VV through March 1, 2010. The amount  does not qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Sec.  1.409A-1(e), and Employee E already participates in another account  balance nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Employee E may make an  initial deferral election on or before March 31, 2008 (within 30 days  after obtaining a legally binding right), because at least 12 months of  additional services are required after the date of election for the risk  of forfeiture to lapse.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Initial election to defer bonus that would otherwise  constitute a short-term deferral. The same facts as Example 5, except  that Employee E does not make an initial deferral election on or before  March 31, 2008. Because the right to the compensation would not be  treated as a deferral of compensation pursuant to Sec. 1.409A-1(b)(4)  absent a deferral election (because the arrangement would be treated as  a short-term deferral), Employee   E may make an initial deferral election provided that the election may  not become effective for 12 months and must defer the payment at least 5  years from March 1, 2010 (the first date the payment could become  substantially vested). Accordingly, Employee E may make an election  before March 1, 2009, provided that the election defers the payment to a  date on or after March 1, 2015 (other than a payment due to death,  disability, unforeseeable emergency, or a change in control event).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Initial election to defer sales commissions. Employer UU  has a calendar year taxable year. As part of Employee F's services for  Employer UU, Employee F sells refrigerators to customers unrelated to  Employee F or Employer UU. Under the employment arrangement, Employee F  is entitled to 10% of the sales price of any refrigerator Employee F  sells, payable only upon the receipt of payment from the customer who  purchased the refrigerator. For purposes of the initial deferral rule,  Employee F is treated as performing the services related to each  refrigerator sale in the calendar year in which each customer pays for  the refrigerator.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Initial election to defer renewal sales commissions. The  same facts as Example 7, except that Employee F also sells warranties  related to the refrigerators sold. Under the warranty arrangement,  refrigerator warranty customers are entitled in a future year to extend  the warranty for an additional cost to be paid at the time of the  extension. Under Employee F's arrangement with Employer UU, Employee F  is entitled to 10% of the amount paid for an extension of any warranty,  payable upon the receipt of payment from the customer extending the  warranty. For purposes of the initial deferral election rule, Employee F  is treated as performing the services related to the amount paid for the  extension of the warranty in the taxable year in which the customer pays  for the warranty extension.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Initial election to defer investment commissions.  Employer TT is in the trade or business of managing financial assets for  customer accounts. Customers who deposit funds in an account with  Employer TT are entitled to remove the account balance of such account  upon 60 days notice to Employer TT. Employee G sells financial products  and provides continuing customer service to certain unrelated customers  involving the deposit and maintenance of funds in customer accounts  managed by Employer TT. Under the employment arrangement, Employee G is  entitled to a set percentage of the aggregate value of the assets held  in the accounts of customers to whom Employee G sold financial products  and provides customer service. Under the arrangement, the aggregate  value of the assets held in the accounts is determined as of June 30 of  each year, and unless Employee G elects to defer the payment, the amount  is payable to Employee G in a lump sum on December 31 of the year in  which the valuation is made. Employee G has no control over the  valuation of the assets held in the accounts, or the calculation of the  amount due Employee G. For purposes of the initial deferral rule,  Employee G is treated as providing the services to which a payment  relates during the July 1 through June 30 period ending on the June 30  date as of which the assets held in the account are valued.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Initial election to defer part-year compensation.  Employee H provides services as a teacher to Employer SS, a school  system. The period of services routinely begins on the second Monday of  August of one year and ends on the first Friday of June of the  subsequent year. Employer SS provides an election to Employee H to  receive the compensation for the period of services ratably over the  period beginning on the second Monday of August of one year and ending  on the last day of August of the subsequent year. Because the  compensation constitutes recurring part-year compensation, as defined in  paragraph (a)(14) of this section, and because the schedule will provide  that all of the recurring part-year compensation is paid no later than  September 30 of the subsequent year, Employee H will be deemed to have  made a timely deferral election with respect to such recurring part-year  compensation if Employee H elects before the first day of the service  period to have the recurring part-year compensation paid under such  schedule.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Initial election to defer negotiated separation pay.  Employer RR decides to terminate Employee J's employment involuntarily.  As part of the process of terminating Employee J, Employer RR enters  into bona fide, arm's length negotiations with respect to the terms of  Employee J's termination of employment. As part of the process, Employer  RR offers Employee J an amount that is in addition to any amounts to  which Employee J is otherwise entitled, payable either as a lump sum  payment at the end of 3 years or in 3 annual payments starting at the  date of termination of employment. The election of the time and form of  payment by Employee J may be made at any time before Employee J accepts  the offer and obtains a legally binding right to the additional amount.  The election may not apply to any amount to which Employee J already had  a legally binding right.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Election of time and form of payments under a window  program. Employer QQ establishes a window program, as defined in Sec.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(vi). Individuals who elect to terminate employment under  the window program are entitled to receive an amount equal to 2 weeks  pay multiplied by every year of service with Employer QQ. The  individuals participating in the window program   may elect to receive the payment as either a lump sum payment payable on  the first day of the month after making the election to participate in  the window program, or as a payment of 3 equal annual installments on  each January 1 of the first 3 years following the election to  participate in the window program. Employee K is eligible to participate  in the window program. Employee K will be treated as making a timely  deferral election if the election as to the time and form of payment is  made on or before the date Employee K's election to participate in the  window program becomes irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Initial election to defer salary earned during final  payroll period beginning in one calendar year and ending in the  subsequent calendar year. Employer PP pays the salary of its employees,  including Employee L, on a bi-weekly basis. One bi-weekly payroll period  runs from December 24, 2008, through January 6, 2009, with a scheduled  payment date of January 13, 2009. Employer PP sponsors, and Employee L  participates in, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which  Employee L may defer a specified percentage of his annual salary. The  plan does not specify that any salary compensation paid for the payroll  period in which falls January 1 is to be treated as compensation for  services performed during the year preceding the year in which falls  that January 1. For purposes of applying the initial deferral election  rules, Employee L is deemed to have performed the services for the  payroll period December 24, 2008, through January 6, 2009, during the  calendar year 2009.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. Application of deferral election rules and anti- acceleration rules to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan linked  to a qualified plan. Employee M participates in a qualified retirement  plan that is a defined benefit plan that offers a subsidized early  retirement benefit to employees who have attained age 55 and completed  30 years of service. Employee M, who has attained age 55 and completed  30 years of service, also participates in a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan, under which the benefit payable is calculated under a  formula, with that benefit then reduced by any benefit that Employee M  has accrued under the qualified retirement plan. In 2008, Employee M  fails to elect the subsidized early retirement benefit under the  qualified retirement plan, with the effect that the amounts payable  under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are increased by an  amount equal to the reduction in the benefit payable under the qualified  plan. In 2009, Employer NN amends the qualified retirement plan to  increase benefits under the plan, resulting in a decrease in the amounts  payable under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan equal to the  increase in the benefit payable under the qualified plan. Neither of  these actions constitutes a deferral election or an acceleration of a  payment under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Subsequent deferral election. Employee N participates in  a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Employee N elects to be paid  in a lump sum payment at the earlier of age 65 or separation from  service. Employee N anticipates that he will work after age 65, and  wishes to defer payment to a later date. Provided that Employee N  continues in employment and makes the election by his 64th birthday,  Employee N may elect to receive a lump sum payment at the earlier of age  70 or separation from service.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. Subsequent deferral election rule--change in form of  payment from lump sum payment to life annuity. Employee P participates  in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Employee P elects to be  paid in a lump sum payment at age 65. Employee P wishes to change the  payment form to a life annuity. Provided that Employee P makes the  election on or before his 64th birthday, Employee P may elect to receive  a life annuity commencing at age 70.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. Subsequent deferral election rule--change in form of  payment from life annuity to lump sum payment. Employee Q participates  in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Employee Q elects to be  paid in a life annuity at age 65. Employee Q wishes to change the  payment form to a lump sum payment.

Subsequent deferral election rule--installment payments  designated as separate payments. Employee R, whose taxable year is the  calendar year, participates in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  that provides for payment in a series of 5 equal annual amounts, each  designated as a separate payment. The first payment is scheduled to be  made on January 1, 2010. Provided that Employee R makes the election on  or before January 1, 2009, Employee R may elect for the first payment  scheduled to be made on January 1, 2010, to be made on January 1, 2015.  If Employee R makes that election, but does not elect to defer the  remaining payments, the remaining payments continue to be due upon  January 1 of the 4 consecutive calendar years commencing on January 1,  2011.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19.

Subsequent deferral election rule--change in form of  payment from one life annuity form to another life annuity form.  Employee U participates in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  that permits Employee U to elect before Employee U's separation from  service whether to be paid in the form of a single life annuity  beginning on the first day of the month following Employee U's  separation from service, or an annuity beginning on the first day of the  month following Employee U's separation from service under which annuity  payments continue for Employee U's lifetime but not less than 10 years.  The two types of annuities are actuarially equivalent at all times  applying reasonable actuarial methods and assumptions. For purposes of  this section, the two types of annuities are treated as a single form of  payment. Accordingly, the election provided under the plan is not  treated as providing a subsequent deferral election or accelerated  payment, and an election by Employee U under the plan between the two  annuity options made before the first scheduled payment date for an  annuity payment is not treated as a subsequent deferral election or an  acceleration of a payment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 22.

A change in  the distribution provision to provide for a payment only upon a change  in control event will violate the rules governing payment provisions,  because the change could result in an acceleration if the change in  control event occurs before Employee X separates from service, or a  subsequent deferral if the change in control does not occur until after  Employee X separates from service. However, provided that Employee X  makes such election on or before the date 1 year before a separation  from service, Employee X may elect to receive a payment upon the later  of a change in control event or 5 years following a separation from  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> does not apply, provided that a taxable year may  again be treated as   the first taxable year in which an individual is classified as a  resident alien if such individual is classified as a resident alien in  that taxable year and has not been classified as a resident alien for  the three consecutive taxable years immediately preceding that taxable  year.

A plan may provide for payment upon the earliest or latest  of more than one event or time, provided that each event or time is  described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section. For examples  illustrating the provisions of this paragraph, see paragraph (i)(1)(vi)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> if it provides for one payment  date or schedule of payments if a specified event occurs on a Monday,  but another payment date or schedule of payments if the event occurs on  any other day of the week. However, a plan that provides for a payment  upon an event described in paragraph (a)(2), (3), (5), or (6) of this  section may allow for an alternative payment schedule if the event  occurs on or before one (but not more than one) specified date, provided  that the addition or deletion of such a different time and form of  payment applicable to an existing deferral is subject to Sec. 1.409A- 2(b) (subsequent deferral elections) and paragraph (j) of this section  (accelerated payments). For example, a plan may provide that a service  provider will receive a lump sum payment of the service provider's  entire benefit under the plan on the first day of the month following a  change in control event that occurs before the service provider attains  age 55, but will receive 5 substantially equal annual payments  commencing on the first day of the month following a change in control  event that occurs on or after the service provider attains age 55. In  the case of a plan that provides that a payment upon an event described  in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (a payment upon a separation from  service), a different time and form of payment may be designated with  respect to a separation from service under each of the following  conditions, provided that the addition or deletion of such a different  time and form of payment applicable to an existing deferral is subject  to Sec. 1.409A-2(b) and paragraph (j) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A separation from service during a limited period of time not to  exceed two years following a change in control event (as defined in  paragraph (i)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A separation from service before or after a specified date (for  example, the attainment of a specified age), or a separation from  service before or after a combination of a specified date, such as  attaining a specified age, and a specified period of service determined  under a predetermined, nondiscretionary, objective formula or pursuant  to the method for crediting service under a qualified plan sponsored by  the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A separation from service not described in paragraphs (c)(1) or  (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When a payment is treated as made upon the designated payment  date. Except as otherwise specified in this section, a payment is  treated as made upon the date specified under the plan (including a date  specified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) if the payment is made  at such date or a later date within the same taxable year of the service  provider or, if later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month  following the date specified under the plan and the service provider is  not permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year of  the payment. In addition, a payment is treated as made upon the date  specified under the plan (including a date specified under paragraph  (a)(4) of this section) and is not treated as an accelerated payment if  the payment is made no earlier than 30 days before the designated  payment date and the service provider is not permitted, directly or  indirectly to designate the taxable year of the payment. For purposes of  this paragraph, if the date specified is only a designated taxable year  of the service provider, or a period of time during such a taxable year,  the date specified under the plan is treated as the first day of such  taxable year or the first day of the period of time during such taxable  year, as applicable. The payment with respect to a stock right generally  occurs upon the exercise of the stock right, so that where a stock right  designates a fixed exercise date, the stock right will be deemed to have  been paid at such date if the exercise and payment occur on such date or  a later date within the same taxable year of the service provider or, if  later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the  exercise date specified under the plan. If calculation of the amount of  the payment is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the  control of the service provider (or service provider's beneficiary), the  payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the   plan if the payment is made during the first taxable year of the service  provider in which the calculation of the amount of the payment is  administratively practicable. For purposes of this paragraph, the  inability of a service recipient to calculate the amount or timing of a  payment due to a failure of a service provider (or service provider's  beneficiary) to provide reasonably available information necessary to  make such calculation does not constitute an event beyond the control of  the service provider. Similarly, if the making of the payment at the  date specified under the plan would jeopardize the ability of the  service recipient to continue as a going concern, the payment will be  treated as made upon the date specified under the plan if the payment is  made during the first taxable year of the service provider in which the  making of the payment would not have such effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>, the term  dividend equivalents means the right to an amount equal to all or a  specified portion of dividends declared and paid, if any, on a specified  number of shares of stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Substitutions. Except as otherwise provided under these  regulations, the payment of an amount as a substitute for a payment of  deferred compensation will be treated as a payment of the deferred  compensation. A forfeiture or voluntary relinquishment of an amount of  deferred compensation will not be treated as a payment of the  compensation, but there is no forfeiture or voluntary relinquishment for  this purpose if an amount is paid, or a legally binding right to a  payment is created, that acts as a substitute for the forfeited or  voluntarily relinquished amount. Whether a payment or a right to a  payment acts as a substitute for a payment of deferred compensation is  determined based on all the facts and circumstances. However, where the  payment of an amount results in an actual or potential reduction of, or  current or future offset to, an amount of deferred compensation, or if  the service provider receives a loan the repayment of which is secured  by or may be accomplished through an offset of or a reduction in an  amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the  payment or loan is a substitute for the deferred compensation. In  addition, where a service provider's right to deferred compensation is  made subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,  pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the  service provider or the service provider's beneficiary, the deferred  compensation is treated as having been paid. For the treatment of  certain offsets, see paragraph (j)(4)(xiii) of this section. Even where  there is no explicit reduction or offset, the payment of an amount or  creation of a new right to a payment proximate to the purported  forfeiture or voluntary relinquishment of a right to deferred  compensation is presumed to be a substitute for the deferred  compensation. The presumption is rebuttable by a showing that the  compensation paid would have been received regardless of the forfeiture  or voluntary relinquishment of the right to deferred compensation.  Factors indicating that a payment would have been received regardless of  such forfeiture or voluntarily relinquishment include that the amount  paid is materially less than the forfeited or relinquished amount, or  consists of a type of payment customarily made in the ordinary course of  business of the service recipient to service providers who do not  forfeit or relinquish deferred compensation (for example, a payment of  accrued but unused leave or a payment   for a release of actual or potential claims). See Sec. 1.409A- 1(b)(9)(i) with respect to certain separation pay plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em>, the service provider is  deemed to have requested that a payment not be made, rather than the  service recipient having failed to make such payment, where the service  recipient's decision to refuse to make the payment is made by the  service provider or a member of the service provider's family (as  defined in section 267(c)(4) applied as if the family of an individual  includes the spouse of any member of the family), or any person or group  of persons over whom the service provider or service provider's family  member has effective control, or any person any portion of whose  compensation is controlled the service provider or service provider's  family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> does not apply, provided that a taxable year may again be  treated as the first taxable year in which an individual is a resident  alien if such individual has not been a resident alien for at least  three consecutive taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year  in which the service provider is again a resident alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions and special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specified time or fixed  schedule--(i) In general. Amounts are payable at a specified time or  pursuant to a fixed schedule if objectively determinable amounts are  payable at a date or dates that are nondiscretionary and objectively  determinable at the time the amount is deferred. An amount is  objectively determinable for this purpose if the amount is specifically  identified or if the amount may be determined at the time payment is due  pursuant to   an objective, nondiscretionary formula specified at the time the amount  is deferred (for example, 50 percent of a specified account balance).  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section, an  amount is not objectively determinable if the amount of the payment is  based all or in part upon the occurrence of an event, including the  consummation of a transaction by, or a payment of an amount to, a  service recipient. If an amount is payable in a service provider's  taxable year (or pursuant to a fixed schedule of taxable years of the  service provider) that is designated at the time the amount is deferred  and that is objectively determinable, the amount is treated as payable  at a specified time (or pursuant to a fixed schedule), provided that for  purposes of the application of the subsequent deferral rules contained  in Sec. 1.409A-2(b), the specified time or fixed schedule of payments  is deemed to refer to the first day of the relevant taxable year or  years. A specified time or fixed schedule also includes the designation  at the time the amount is deferred of a defined period or periods within  the service provider's taxable year or taxable years that are  objectively determinable, provided that no such defined period may begin  within one taxable year and end within another taxable year, and  provided further that for purposes of the application of the subsequent  deferral rules contained in Sec. 1.409A-2(b), the specified time or  fixed schedule of payments is deemed to refer to the first day of the  relevant period in which the payment will be made. A plan may provide  that a payment upon the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture is to  be made in accordance with a fixed schedule that is objectively  determinable based on the date the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses  (disregarding any discretionary acceleration of the lapse of the  substantial risk of forfeiture), provided that the schedule must be  fixed on the date the time and form of payment are designated, and any  change in the fixed schedule will constitute a change in the time and  form of payment. For example, a plan that provides for a bonus payment  subject to the condition that the service provider complete three years  of service, and subject to the further condition that such requirement  of continued services will lapse upon the occurrence of an initial  public offering, which condition if applied alone would constitute a  substantial risk of forfeiture, may provide that a service provider is  entitled to substantially equal payments on each of the first three  anniversaries of the date the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses (the  earlier of three years of service or the date of an initial public  offering).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment schedules with formula and fixed limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Individual limitations. A schedule of payments does not fail to be a  fixed schedule of payments where the amount of a payment or payments  that may be paid at a specified time or during a specified period is  limited by an objective nondiscretionary formula or a specified amount  that is not under the effective control of the service provider and is  not subject to the exercise of discretion by the service recipient,  where such limitation is established on or before the date the time and  form of payment is otherwise required to be set under these regulations,  and the plan specifies the time and form of any payment that will be  made or completed after its original payment date due to the application  of the limitation. A change in the limitation or a change in the time  and form of any payment that exceeds the limitation is subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1.409A-2(b) (subsequent deferral elections) and  paragraph (j) of this section (accelerated payments). For purposes of  this paragraph, a plan provision that reduces a schedule of periodic  payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of Social Security  payments received or receivable may be treated as a nondiscretionary,  objective formula limitation, if such reduction does not otherwise  affect the time of payment of the deferred compensation (other than a  forfeiture due to the reduction), including changes based on the service  provider's eligibility or elections related to Social Security benefits.  Similarly, a plan provision that reduces a schedule of periodic payments  on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of bona fide disability pay  (within the meaning   of Sec. 1.409A-1(a)(5)) received or receivable may be treated as a  nondiscretionary, objective formula limitation, if the disability  payments are made pursuant to a plan sponsored by the service recipient  that covers a substantial number of service providers and was  established before the service provider became disabled, and if such  reduction does not otherwise affect the time of payment of the deferred  compensation (other than a forfeiture due to the reduction). Whether an  amendment to, or other change in the benefit payable under, such bona  fide disability plan results in an acceleration of a payment for  purposes of paragraph (j) of this section or a subsequent election to  delay the time or change the form of payment for purposes of Sec.  1.409A-2(b) is determined based on all of the relevant facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitations on aggregate payments to all participants in  substantially identical plans. A schedule of payments does not fail to  be a fixed schedule of payments where the amount of the aggregate  payments that will be made during a specified period of time to all  participants in substantially identical plans is limited by an objective  nondiscretionary formula or specified amount that is not under the  effective control of the service provider and is not subject to the  exercise of discretion by the service recipient, where the limit is  established on or before the date the time and form of payment of the  amount deferred is otherwise required to be set under these regulations,  the method of allocating payments among the participants where there is  an overall limitation on the aggregate amount that may be paid to a  group of service providers during a specified period is an objective  nondiscretionary allocation method that is not under the effective  control of the service provider and is not subject to the exercise of  discretion by the service recipient, the method is established on or  before the date the time and form of payment of the amount deferred is  otherwise required to be set, and the plan specifies the time and form  of any payment of any amount that will be paid after its original  payment date due to the application of the limitation. A change in the  limitation or a change in the time and form of payment of any payment  that is not otherwise made at the scheduled payment date due to  application of the formula limitation is subject to the requirements of  Sec. 1.409A-2(b) (subsequent deferral elections) and paragraph (j) of  this section (accelerated payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payment schedules determined by timing of payments received by  the service recipient. A payment schedule determined by reference to the  timing of payments received by the service recipient (not including  payments from one entity to another entity where both entities are  treated as part of a single service recipient), meets the requirements  of a specified date or fixed schedule of payments if the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The payments due to the service recipient arise from bona fide  and routine transactions in the ordinary course of business of the  service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The service provider does not have effective control of the  service recipient, the person from whom such amounts are due, or the  collection of any of the amounts due to the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The payment schedule provides an objective, nondiscretionary  method of identification of the payments to the service recipient from  which the amount of the payment from the service recipient to the  service provider is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The payment schedule provides an objective, nondiscretionary  schedule under which the payments will be made to the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The payments to the service recipient from which the amount of  the payments from service recipient to the service provider are  determined result from sales of a type that the service recipient is in  the trade or business of making and makes frequently, and either all  such sales by the service recipient are taken into account for purposes  of determining the payment to the service provider, or there is a  legitimate, non-tax business reason for identifying the specific sales  taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reimbursement or in-kind benefit plans--(A) General rule. A  plan that provides for reimbursements of expenses incurred by a service  provider, or in-kind benefits, meets the requirements of a specified  date or fixed schedule of payments with respect to such reimbursements  or benefits if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan provides an objectively determinable nondiscretionary  definition of the expenses eligible for reimbursement or of the in-kind  benefits to be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plan provides for the reimbursement of expenses incurred or  for the provision of the in-kind benefits during an objectively and  specifically prescribed period (including the lifetime of the service  provider).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan provides that the amount of expenses eligible for  reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a service provider's  taxable year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or  in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The reimbursement of an eligible expense is made on or before  the last day of the service provider's taxable year following the  taxable year in which the expense was incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to  liquidation or exchange for another benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Medical reimbursement arrangements. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, an arrangement providing for the reimbursement of expenses  referred to in section 105(b) will not be deemed to fail to meet the  requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(iv)(A)(3) of this section solely  because the arrangement provides for a limit on the amount of expenses  that may be reimbursed under such arrangement over some or all of the  period in which the reimbursement arrangement remains in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> otherwise alters the  application of section 409A to the underlying compensation arrangement  or other arrangement that results in the taxes subject to the right to  the tax gross-up payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples (in which each employee is an  individual whose taxable year is the calendar year) illustrate the  principles of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (i)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employee A provides services as an employee of Employer  Z, but is not a specified employee. Employee A participates in a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan providing for a lump sum payment  payable on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which Employee  A separates from service. The plan provides for a payment upon a  separation from service in compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employee B provides services as an employee of Employer  Y, but is not a specified employee. Employee B participates in a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan providing for a lump sum payment  payable on or before the 90th day immediately following the date upon  which Employee B separates from service. Employer Y retains the sole  discretion to determine when during the 90-day period the payment will  be made. Although the plan does not specify a period during one calendar  year in which the payment will be made, the plan provides for a payment  upon a separation from service in compliance with this section because  the period over which the payment may be made is not longer than 90  days.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employee C provides services as an employee of Employer  X, but is not a specified employee. Employee C participates in a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan providing for a lump sum payment  payable on or before the 180th day following the date upon which  Employee C separates from service. Employer X retains the sole  discretion to determine when during the 180-day period the payment will  be made. Because the plan does not specify a period during one calendar  year in which the payment will be made, and because the period over  which the payment may be made is longer than 90 days, the plan does not  provide for a payment upon a separation from service that complies with  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Employee D provides services as an employee of Employer  W, but is not a specified employee. Employee D participates in a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan providing for 10 installment  payments payable on the first 10 anniversaries of the date Employee D  separates from service, provided that no installment payment in any year  may be more than 1% of Employer W's net income for the previous calendar  year, and provided further that the excess over such limit that would  otherwise be payable but is not paid due to application of the limit  will become payable as of the first installment payment date at which  time such amount, in combination with any installment payment otherwise  due Employee D, does not exceed 1% of Employer W's net income for the  previous calendar year. Provided that Employee D does not retain  effective control of the calculation of Employer W's net income or the  amount that Employee D will not be paid due to application of the limit,  the plan provides for a schedule of payments upon a separation from  service that complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Employee E and Employee F provide services as employees  of Employer V, but neither is a specified employee. Employee E and  Employee F both participate in substantially identical nonqualified  deferred compensation plans providing for 10 installment payments  payable on the first 10 anniversaries of the date the respective  employee separates from service, provided that the total amount of  installment payments in any year may not be more than 1% of Employer V's  net income for the previous year, that where any payments are not made  due to application of the limit the determination of the amount not paid  to a particular employee will be made by applying the overall limit  proportionately based upon the installment payment due the employee that  year, and that the excess over such limit that would otherwise be  payable but is not paid due to application of the limit will become  payable as of the first installment payment date at which time such  amount, in combination with any installment payments otherwise due the  participants, does not exceed 1% of Employer V's net income for the  previous calendar year. Provided that neither Employee E nor Employee F  retains effective control of the calculation of Employer V's net income  or the amount that the respective employee will not be paid due to  application of the limit, the plan provides for a schedule of payments  upon a separation from service that complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Employee G provides services as an employee of Employer  U, but is not a specified employee. As a bona fide part of this  employment relationship, Employee G provides professional services to  clients of Employer U as part of the bona fide, ordinary course of  Employer U's trade or business. Under an arrangement between Employee G  and Employer U, Employer U agrees to pay Employee G upon Employee G's  separation from service an amount equal to 5% of any amount collected  from Company T, a client of Employer U for which Employee G performed  services during his employment with Employer U, during the 36 months  following Employee G's separation from service. Under the arrangement,  the amounts due to Employee G based upon payments received by Employer U  during any calendar year are payable to Employee G on April 1 of the  subsequent calendar year. Provided that Employee G does not have  effective control of Employer U, Company T, or the collection of any  amounts due Employer Y from Company T, the arrangement provides for a  schedule of payments upon a separation from service that complies with  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Employee H provides services as an employee of Employer  S, but is not a specified employee. Under a plan sponsored by Employer  S, Employee H has a legally binding right upon a separation from service  to the reimbursement of country club dues paid in the calendar year of  the separation from service and each of the next 3 calendar years  following the separation from service in an amount not to exceed $30,000  in any calendar year, provided that the amount of   dues paid in any calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement  equals only the amount actually expended during such calendar year, and  the maximum amount available for reimbursement in any calendar year will  not be increased or decreased to reflect the amount expended or  reimbursed in a prior or subsequent calendar year. The plan further  provides that any reimbursement must be paid to Employee H by December  31 of the calendar year following the year in which Employee H pays the  country club dues. The reimbursement plan provides for a schedule of  payments upon a separation from service that complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Employee J provides services as an employee of Employer  Q, but is not a specified employee.

The plan further provides  that any reimbursement must be paid to Employee J by December 31 of the  calendar year following the year in which Employee J pays the country  club dues. Because the reimbursement of a payment of country club dues  in one calendar year may affect the amount of country club dues  available for reimbursement in another calendar year, the plan does not  provide for a schedule of payments upon a separation from service that  complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> does not apply to a payment made under the circumstances  described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order),  (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of  employment taxes) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of payment rules to delayed payments. The required  delay in payment is met if payments to which a specified employee would  otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of  separation from service are accumulated and paid on the first day of the  seventh month following the date of separation from service, or if each  payment to which a specified employee is otherwise entitled upon a  separation from service is delayed by six months. A service recipient  may retain discretion to choose which method will be implemented,  provided that no direct or indirect election as to the method may be  provided to the service provider. For an affected specified employee, a  date upon which the plan or the service recipient designates that the  payment will be made after the six-month delay is treated as a fixed  payment date for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section once the  separation from service has occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> is to be determined based on  the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but, in any case, a  distribution on account of unforeseeable emergency may not be made to  the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through  reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by  liquidation of the service provider's assets, to the extent the  liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or  by cessation of deferrals under the plan. A plan may provide for a  payment upon a specific type or types of unforeseeable emergency,  without providing for payment upon all unforeseeable emergencies,  provided that any event upon which a payment may be made qualifies as an  unforeseeable emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of payment permitted upon an unforeseeable emergency.  Distributions because of an unforeseeable emergency must be limited to  the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (which may  include amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state, local, or foreign  income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the  distribution). Determinations of amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy  the emergency need must take into account any additional compensation  that is available if the plan provides for cancellation of a deferral  election upon a payment due to an unforeseeable emergency. See paragraph  (j)(4)(viii) of this section. However, the determination of amounts  reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need is not required to  take into account any additional compensation that is available from a  qualified employer plan as defined in Sec. 1.409A-1(a)(2) (including  any amount available by obtaining a loan under the plan), or that due to  the unforeseeable emergency is available under another nonqualified  deferred compensation plan (including a plan that would provide for  deferred compensation except due to the application of the effective  date provisions under Sec. 1.409A-6). The payment may be made from any  plan in which the service provider participates that provides for  payment upon an unforeseeable emergency, provided that the plan under  which the payment was made must be designated at the time of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payments due to an unforeseeable emergency. A service provider  may retain discretion with respect to whether to apply for a payment  upon an unforeseeable emergency, and a service recipient may retain  discretion with respect to whether to make a payment available under the  plan due to an unforeseeable emergency. A service provider who has  experienced an unforeseeable emergency will not be treated as making a  subsequent deferral election under Sec. 1.409A-2(b) (subsequent  deferral election rules) if the service provider does not apply for or  elect to receive a payment available under the plan. A service recipient  will not be treated as making a subsequent deferral election under Sec.  1.409A-2(b) (subsequent deferral election rules) if the service  recipient exercises its discretion not to make a payment otherwise  available due to an unforeseeable emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

To qualify as a change in control event, the  occurrence of the event must be objectively determinable and any  requirement that any other person or group, such as a plan administrator  or compensation committee, certify the occurrence of a change in control  event must be strictly ministerial and not involve any discretionary  authority. The plan may provide for a payment on a particular type or  types of change in control events, and need not provide for a payment on  all such events, provided that each event upon which a payment is  provided qualifies as a change in control event.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a  vested option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested  (as defined by Sec. 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option  is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rules for certain delayed payments pursuant to a change  in control event--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Certain transaction-based compensation. Payments  of compensation related to a change in control event described in  paragraph (i)(5)(v) of this section (change in the ownership of a  corporation) or paragraph (i)(5)(vii) of this section (change in the  ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation's assets), that  occur because a service recipient purchases its stock held by the  service provider or because the service recipient or a third party  purchases a stock right held by a service provider, or that are  calculated by reference to the value of stock of the service recipient  (collectively, transaction-based compensation), may be treated as paid  at a designated date or pursuant to a payment schedule that complies  with the requirements of section 409A if the transaction-based  compensation is paid on the same schedule and under the same terms and  conditions as apply to payments to shareholders generally with respect  to stock of the service recipient pursuant to a change in control event  described in paragraph (i)(5)(v) of this section (change in the  ownership of a corporation) or as apply to payments to the service  recipient pursuant to a change in control event described in paragraph  (i)(5)(vii) of this section (change in the ownership of a substantial  portion of a corporation's assets), and to the extent that the  transaction-based compensation is paid not later than five years after  the change in control event, the payment of such compensation will not  violate the initial or subsequent deferral election rules set out in  Sec. 1.409A-2(a) and (b) solely as a result of such transaction-based  compensation being paid pursuant to such schedule and terms and  conditions. If before and in connection with a change in control event  described in paragraph (i)(5)(v) or (i)(5)(vii) of this section,  transaction-based compensation that would otherwise be payable as a  result of such event is made subject to a condition on payment that  constitutes a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in Sec.  1.409A-1(d), without regard to the provisions of that section under  which additions or extensions of forfeiture conditions are disregarded)  and the transaction-based compensation is payable under the same terms  and conditions as apply to payments made to shareholders generally with  respect to stock of the service recipient pursuant to a change in  control event described in paragraph (i)(5)(v) of this section or to  payments to the service recipient pursuant to a change in control event  described in paragraph (i)(5)(vii) of this section, for purposes of  determining whether such transaction-based compensation is a short-term  deferral the requirements of Sec. 1.409A-1(b)(4) are applied as if the  legally binding right to such transaction-based compensation arose on  the date that it became subject to such substantial risk of forfeiture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain nonvested compensation. Notwithstanding the provisions  of Sec. 1.409A-1(d) (definition of a substantial   risk of forfeiture) that disregard the extension or modification of a  condition for purposes of determining whether a condition on payment  constitutes a substantial risk of forfeiture, a condition that is a  substantial risk of forfeiture that otherwise would lapse as a result of  a change in control event described in paragraph (i)(5)(v) or  (i)(5)(vii) of this section may be extended or modified before and in  connection with such event to provide for a condition on payment that  will not lapse as a result of such change in control event, and such  extended or modified condition will be treated as continuing to subject  the amount to a substantial risk of forfeiture, provided that the  transaction constituting the change in control event is a bona fide  arm's length transaction between the service recipient or its  shareholders and one or more parties who are unrelated to the service  recipient and service provider (applying the rules of Sec. 1.409A- 1(f)(2)(ii)) and the modified or extended condition to which the payment  is subject would otherwise be treated as a substantial risk of  forfeiture under Sec. 1.409A-1(d) (without regard to the provisions  disregarding additions or extensions of forfeiture conditions). In such  a case, the continued application of a fixed schedule of payments based  upon the lapse of the substantial risk of forfeiture, so that payments  commence upon the lapse of the modified or extended condition on  payment, will not be treated as a change in the fixed schedule of  payments for purposes of Sec. 1.409A-2(b) (subsequent deferral  elections) or paragraph (j) of this section (prohibition on the  acceleration of payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Change in the ownership of a corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except  as provided in paragraph (i)(5)(vi)(C) of this section, a change in the  ownership of a corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or  more than one person acting as a group (as defined in paragraph  (i)(5)(v)(B) of this section), acquires ownership of stock of the  corporation that, together with stock held by such person or group,  constitutes more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total  voting power of the stock of such corporation. A nonqualified deferred  compensation plan may provide that amounts payable upon a change in the  ownership of a corporation will be paid only if the conditions in the  preceding sentence are satisfied but substituting a percentage specified  in the plan that is higher than 50 percent for the words ``50 percent''  in the preceding sentence, but only if the provision is set forth in the  plan no later than the date by which the time and form of payment must  be established under Sec. 1.409A-2. However, if any one person, or more  than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50  percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the  stock of a corporation (or such higher percentage specified in  accordance with the preceding sentence), the acquisition of additional  stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change  in the ownership of the corporation (or to cause a change in the  effective control of the corporation (within the meaning of paragraph  (i)(5)(vi) of this section)). An increase in the percentage of stock  owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a  transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchange for  property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this  section. This section applies only when there is a transfer of stock of  a corporation (or issuance of stock of a corporation) and stock in such  corporation remains outstanding after the transaction (see paragraph  (i)(5)(vii) of this section for rules regarding the transfer of assets  of a corporation). See Sec. 1.280G-1, Q&A-27;(d), Example 1, Example 2,  Example 5, and Example 6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Persons acting as a group. For purposes of paragraph  (i)(5)(v)(A) of this section, persons will not be considered to be  acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same  corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public  offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if  they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger,  consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business  transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity, owns  stock in both corporations that enter into a   merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar  transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with  other shareholders only with respect to the ownership in that  corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change and not  with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation. See  Sec. 1.280G-1, Q&A-27;(d), Example 3 and Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Change in the effective control of a corporation--(A) In  general. Notwithstanding that a corporation has not undergone a change  in ownership under paragraph (i)(5)(v) of this section, a change in the  effective control of the corporation occurs only on either of the  following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date any one person, or more than one person acting as a  group (as determined under paragraph (i)(5)(v)(B) of this section),  acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date  of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of  stock of the corporation possessing 30 percent or more of the total  voting power of the stock of such corporation. A nonqualified deferred  compensation plan may provide that amounts payable upon an effective  change in control of a corporation will be paid only if the conditions  in the preceding sentence are satisfied but substituting a percentage  specified in the plan that is higher than 30 percent for the word ``30  percent'' in the preceding sentence, but only if the percentage is set  forth in the plan no later than the date by which the time and form of  payment must be established under Sec. 1.409A-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> would  refer solely to Corporation A. A nonqualified deferred compensation plan  may provide that amounts payable upon a change in the effective control  of a corporation will be paid only if the conditions in the first  sentence of this paragraph are satisfied substituting a portion of the  members of the corporation's board of directors that is higher than the  words ``a majority of the members of the corporation's board of  directors'' in the first sentence of this paragraph, but only if the  higher portion is set forth in the plan no later than the date by which  the time and form of payment must be established under Sec. 1.409A- 2(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiple change in control events. A change in effective control  may occur in a transaction in which one of the two corporations involved  in the transaction has a change in control event under paragraph  (i)(5)(v) or (i)(5)(vii) of this section. Thus, for example, assume  Corporation P transfers more than 40 percent of the total gross fair  market value of its assets to Corporation O in exchange for 35 percent  of O's stock. P has undergone a change in ownership of a substantial  portion of its assets under paragraph (i)(5)(vii) of this section and O  has a change in effective control under this paragraph (i)(5)(vi).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Acquisition of additional control. If any one person, or more  than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control  a corporation (within the meaning of this paragraph (i)(5)(vi)), the  acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person  or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control  of the corporation (or to cause a change in the ownership of the  corporation within the meaning of paragraph (i)(5)(v) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Persons acting as a group. Persons will not be considered to be  acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same  corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public  offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a   group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger,  consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business  transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity, owns  stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation,  purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such  shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other  shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that  corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change and not  with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.

For example, a  transfer to a corporation in which the transferor corporation has no  ownership interest before the transaction, but that is a majority-owned  subsidiary of the transferor corporation after the transaction is not  treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of the transferor  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Persons acting as a group. Persons will not be considered to be  acting as a group solely because they purchase assets of the same  corporation at the same time. However, persons will be considered to be  acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a  merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar  business transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an  entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a  merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar  transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with  other shareholders in a corporation only to the extent of the ownership  in that corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change and  not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation. See  Sec. 1.280G-1, Q&A-27;(d), Example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Certain back-to-back arrangements--(i) In general. This  paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(6)</em> applies where a service provider is   providing services to a service recipient (the intermediate service  recipient), who in turn is providing services to another service  recipient (the ultimate service recipient), the services provided by the  service provider to the intermediate service recipient are closely  related to the services provided by the intermediate service recipient  to the ultimate service recipient, there is a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan providing for payments by the ultimate service  recipient to the intermediate service recipient (the ultimate service  recipient plan), there is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or  other agreement, method, program, or other arrangement providing for  payments of compensation by the intermediate service recipient to the  service provider (the intermediate service recipient plan), and the  intermediate service recipient plan provides for a payment upon the  occurrence of an event described in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), or  (6) of this section. In such a case, notwithstanding the generally  applicable limits on payments in paragraph (a) of this section, the  ultimate service recipient plan may provide for a payment to the  intermediate service recipient upon the occurrence of a payment event  under the intermediate service recipient plan described in paragraph  (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), or (6) of this section if the time and form of  payment is defined as the same time and form of payment provided under  the intermediate service recipient plan, the amount of the payment under  the ultimate service recipient plan does not exceed the amount of the  payment under the intermediate service recipient plan, and the ultimate  service recipient plan and the intermediate service recipient plan  otherwise satisfy the requirements of section 409A (regardless of  whether such plan is subject to section 409A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section  are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Company B (intermediate service recipient) provides  services to Company C (ultimate service recipient). Employee A (service  provider) provides services to Company B that are closely related to the  services Company B provides to Company C. Pursuant to a nonqualified  deferred compensation plan meeting the requirements of section 409A,  Employee A is entitled to a payment of deferred compensation upon a  separation from service with Company B (the intermediate service  recipient plan). Under an arrangement between Company B and Company C  (the ultimate service recipient plan), Company C agrees to pay an amount  of deferred compensation to Company B upon Employee A's separation from  service with Company B, in accordance with the time, form and amount of  payment provided in the intermediate service recipient plan. Provided  that the intermediate service recipient plan and the ultimate service  recipient plan otherwise comply with the requirements of section 409A  (regardless of whether such arrangements are subject to section 409A),  Company C's payment to Company B of the amount due under the ultimate  service recipient plan upon the separation from service of Employee A  from Company B may constitute a permissible payment event for purposes  of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em>, an impermissible acceleration does  not occur if payment is made in accordance with plan provisions or an  election as to the time and form of payment in effect at the time of  initial deferral (or added in accordance with the rules applicable to  subsequent deferral elections under Sec. 1.409A-2(b)) pursuant to which  payment is required to be made on an accelerated schedule as a result of  an intervening event that is an event described in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>,  (2), (3), (5), or (6) of this section. For example, a plan may provide  that a participant will receive six installment payments commencing at  separation from service, and also provide that if the participant dies  after such payments commence but before all payments have been made, all  remaining amounts will be paid in a lump sum   payment. Additionally, it is not an acceleration of the time or schedule  of payment of a deferral of compensation if a service recipient waives  or accelerates the satisfaction of a condition constituting a  substantial risk of forfeiture applicable to such deferral of  compensation, provided that the requirements of section 409A (including  the requirement that the payment be made upon a permissible payment  event) are otherwise satisfied with respect to such deferral of  compensation. For example, if a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  provides for a lump sum payment of the vested benefit upon separation  from service, and the benefit vests under the plan only after 10 years  of service, it is not a violation of the requirements of section 409A if  the service recipient reduces the vesting requirement to five years of  service, even if a service provider becomes vested as a result and  receives a payment in connection with a separation from service before  the service provider would have completed 10 years of service. However,  if the plan in this example had provided for a payment at a fixed date,  rather than at separation from service, the date of payment could not be  accelerated due to the accelerated vesting. For the definition of a  payment for purposes of this paragraph (j), see Sec. 1.409A-2(b)(5)  (coordination of the subsequent deferral election rules with the  prohibition on acceleration of payments). For other permissible  payments, see Sec. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) (certain immediate payments of  remaining installments) and paragraph (d) of this section (certain  payments made no more than 30 days before the designated payment date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to multiple payment events. Generally, the addition  of a permissible payment event, the deletion of a permissible payment  event, or the substitution of one permissible payment event for another  permissible payment event, results in an acceleration of a payment if  the addition, deletion, or substitution could result in the payment  being made at an earlier date than such payment would have been made  absent such addition, deletion, or substitution. Notwithstanding the  previous sentence, the addition of death, disability (as defined in  paragraph (i)(4) of this section), or an unforeseeable emergency (as  defined in paragraph (i)(3) of this section), as a potentially earlier  alternative payment event to an amount previously deferred will not be  treated as resulting in an acceleration of a payment, even if such  addition results in the payment being paid at an earlier time than such  payment would have been made absent the addition of the payment event.  However, the addition of such a payment event as a potentially later  alternative payment event generally is subject to the rules governing  changes in the time and form of payment (see Sec. 1.409A-2(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beneficiaries. The rules of this paragraph (j) apply to  elections by beneficiaries with respect to the time and form of payment,  as well as elections by service providers or service recipients with  respect to the time and form of payment to beneficiaries. An election to  change the identity of a beneficiary does not constitute an acceleration  of a payment merely because the election changes the identity of the  recipient of the payment, if the time and form of the payment is not  otherwise changed. In addition, an election before the commencement of a  life annuity to change the identity of a beneficiary does not constitute  an acceleration of a payment if the change in the time of payments stems  solely from the different life expectancy of the new beneficiary, such  as in the case of a joint and survivor annuity, and does not change the  commencement date of the life annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise expressly  provided, a plan may provide for the acceleration of a payment in  accordance with paragraphs (j)(4)(ii) through (xiv) of this section, or  may provide a service recipient discretion to accelerate payments in  accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (j)(4)(ii) through (xiv) of  this section. A plan may not provide a service provider discretion with  respect to whether a payment will be accelerated, and a service  recipient may not provide a service provider a direct or indirect  election as to whether the service recipient's discretion to accelerate  a payment will be exercised, even if such acceleration would be  permitted under paragraphs (j)(4)(ii)   through (xiv) of this section. Whether a service recipient has provided  a service provider an election as to whether the service recipient's  discretion to accelerate a payment will be exercised is determined based  on all the facts and circumstances, including whether similarly situated  service providers have been treated differently. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraphs (j)(4)(ii) through (xiv) of this section, the  plan need not set forth the exception in writing, and provided all other  requirements of this section are met, the making of such a payment or  the addition of a plan term permitting the making of such a payment will  not constitute the acceleration of a payment, and the failure to make  such a payment or the deletion or modification of a plan term permitting  the making of such a payment will not be subject to the rules regarding  a change in the time and form of payment under Sec. 1.409A-2(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Domestic relations order. A plan may provide for acceleration  of the time or schedule of a payment under the plan to an individual  other than the service provider, or a payment under such plan may be  made to an individual other than the service provider, to the extent  necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as defined in section  414(p)(1)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conflicts of interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Compliance with ethics agreements  with the Federal government. A plan may provide for acceleration of the  time or schedule of a payment under the plan, or a payment may be made  under a plan, to the extent necessary for any Federal officer or  employee in the executive branch to comply with an ethics agreement with  the Federal government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B))</em> from sources within the  foreign country that promulgated such law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 457 plans.

A plan may provide  for an acceleration of the time and form of a payment, or a payment may  be made under such plan, to reflect payment of state, local, or foreign  tax obligations arising from participation in the plan that apply to an  amount deferred under the plan before the amount is paid or made  available to the participant (the state, local, or foreign tax amount).  Such payment may not exceed the amount of such taxes due as a result of  participation in the plan. Such payment may be made by distributions to  the participant in the form of withholding pursuant to provisions of  applicable state, local, or foreign law or by distribution directly to  the participant. Additionally, an arrangement may provide for the  acceleration of the time or schedule of payment, or a payment may be  made under such arrangement, to pay the income tax at source on wages  imposed under section 3401 as   a result of such payment and to pay the additional income tax at source  on wages imposed under section 3401 attributable to such additional  section 3401 wages and taxes.

A plan  may provide for a cancellation of a service provider's deferral  election, or a cancellation of such election may be made, where such  cancellation occurs by the later of the end of the taxable year of the  service provider or the 15th day of the third month following the date  the service provider incurs a disability. For purposes of this  paragraph, a disability refers to any medically determinable physical or  mental impairment resulting in the service provider's inability to  perform the duties of his or her position or any substantially similar  position, where such impairment can be expected to result in death or  can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six  months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Certain offsets. A plan may provide for the acceleration of  the time or schedule of a payment, or a payment may be made under such  plan, as satisfaction of a debt of the service provider to the service  recipient, where such debt is incurred in the ordinary course of the  service relationship between the service recipient and the service  provider, the entire amount of reduction in any of the service  recipient's taxable years does not exceed $5,000, and the reduction is  made at the same time and in the same amount as the debt otherwise would  have been due and collected from the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em>.

A payment will be presumed not to meet  this exception unless the payment is subject to a substantial reduction  in the value of the payment made in relation to the amount that would  have been payable had there been no dispute as to the service provider's  right to the payment. For this purpose, a reduction that is less than 25  percent of the present value of the deferred amount in dispute generally  is not a substantial reduction. In addition, a payment will be presumed  not to meet this exception if the payment is made proximate to a  downturn in the financial health of the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> and  (ii) of this section, the change in the amount deferred under the  nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not exceed the change in  the amounts deferred under the qualified employer plan or the broad- based foreign retirement plan, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under the qualified  employer plan or broad-based foreign retirement plan with respect to  whether to elect to receive a subsidized benefit or an ancillary benefit  under the qualified employer plan or broad-based foreign retirement  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amendment of a qualified employer plan or broad-based  foreign retirement plan to increase benefits provided under such plan,  or to add or remove a subsidized benefit or an ancillary benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under a qualified  employer plan with respect to elective deferrals and other employee pre- tax contributions subject to the contribution restrictions under section  401(a)(30) or section 402(g), including an adjustment to a deferral  election under such qualified employer plan, provided that for any given  taxable year, the service provider's action or inaction does not result  in a decrease in the amounts deferred under all nonqualified deferred  compensation plans in which the service provider participates (other  than amounts described in paragraph (j)(5)(iv) of this section) in  excess of the limit with respect to elective deferrals under section  402(g)(1)(A), (B), and (C) in effect for the taxable year in which such  action or inaction occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A service provider's action or inaction under a qualified  employer plan with respect to elective deferrals and other employee pre- tax contributions subject to the contributions restrictions under  section 401(a)(30) or section 402(g), and after-tax contributions by the  service provider to a qualified employer plan that provides for such  contributions, that affects the amounts that are credited under one or  more nonqualified deferred compensation plans as matching amounts or  other similar amounts contingent on such elective deferrals, pre-tax  contributions, or after-tax contributions, provided that the total of  such matching or contingent amounts, as applicable, never exceeds 100  percent of the matching or contingent amounts that would be provided  under the qualified employer plan absent any plan-based restrictions  that reflect limits on qualified plan contributions under the Internal  Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Changes in elections under a cafeteria plan. A change in an  election under a cafeteria plan (as defined in section 125(d)) does not  result in an accelerated payment of an amount deferred under a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan to the extent that the change in  the amount deferred under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan  results solely from the application of the change in amount eligible to  be treated as compensation under the terms of the nonqualified deferred  compensation plan resulting from the election change under the cafeteria  plan, to a benefit formula under the nonqualified deferred compensation  plan based upon the service provider's eligible compensation, and only  to the   extent that such change applies in the same manner as any other increase  or decrease in compensation would apply to such benefit formula.

Except as otherwise provided in this  section, section 409A applies with respect to amounts deferred in  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, and with respect to  amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005, if  the plan under which the deferral is made is materially modified after  October 3, 2004. For amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before  January 1, 2005, under a plan that is materially modified after October  3, 2004, whether the plan complies with the requirements of section 409A  and these regulations is determined by reference to the terms of the  plan in effect as of, and any actions taken under the plan on or after,  the date of the material modification. Section 409A is applicable with  respect to earnings on amounts deferred only to the extent that section  409A is applicable with respect to the amounts deferred. Accordingly,  section 409A does not apply with respect to earnings on amounts deferred  before January 1, 2005, unless section 409A applies with respect to the  amounts deferred. For this purpose, a right to earnings that is subject  to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(c)) or a  requirement to perform further services, on an amount deferred that is  not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in Sec.  1.83-3(c)) or a requirement to perform further services, is not treated  as earnings on the amount deferred, but a separate right to  compensation. Except as otherwise provided in applicable guidance (see  Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1.409A-1 through 1.409A-5 and this section provide the exclusive means  of identifying agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements  subject to section 409A, and the exclusive means of satisfying the  requirements of section 409A with respect to such agreements, methods,  programs, or other arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collectively bargained plans. Section 409A does not apply with  respect to amounts deferred under a plan maintained pursuant to one or  more bona fide collective bargaining agreements in effect on October 3,  2004, for the period ending on the earlier of the date on which the last  of such collective bargaining agreements terminates (determined without  regard to any extension thereof after October 3, 2004) or December 31,  2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, a stock option, stock  appreciation right, or similar compensation that on or before December  31, 2004, was immediately exercisable for cash or substantially vested  property (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) is treated as earned and  vested, regardless of whether the right would terminate if the service  provider ceased providing services for the service recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculation of amount of compensation deferred for statutory  effective date purposes--(i) Nonaccount balance plans. The amount of  compensation deferred before January 1, 2005, under a nonqualified  deferred compensation plan that is a nonaccount balance plan (as defined  in Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C)), equals the present value of the amount  to which the service provider would have been entitled under the plan if  the service provider voluntarily terminated services without cause on  December 31, 2004, and received a payment of the benefits available from  the plan on the earliest possible date allowed under the plan to receive  a payment of benefits following the termination of services, and  received the benefits in the form with the maximum value.</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any subsequent taxable year of  the service provider, the grandfathered amount may increase to equal the  present value of the benefit the service provider actually becomes  entitled to, in the form and at the time actually paid, determined under  the terms of the plan (including applicable limits under the Internal  Revenue Code), as in effect on October 3, 2004, without regard to any  further services rendered by the service provider after December 31,  2004, or any other events affecting the amount of or the entitlement to  benefits (other than a participant election with respect to the time or  form of an available benefit). For purposes of calculating the present  value of a benefit under this paragraph (a)(3)(i), reasonable actuarial  assumptions and methods must be used. Whether assumptions and methods  are reasonable for this purpose is determined as of each date the  benefit is valued for purposes of determining the grandfathered benefit,  provided that any reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods that were  used by the service recipient with respect to such benefit as of  December 31, 2004, will continue to be treated as reasonable assumptions  and methods for purposes of calculating the grandfathered benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial assumptions and methods will be presumed reasonable if  they are the same as those used to value benefits under a qualified plan  sponsored by the service recipient the benefits under which are part of  the benefit formula under, or otherwise impact the amount of benefits  under, the nonaccount balance nonqualified deferred compensation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Account balance plans. The amount of compensation deferred  before January 1, 2005, under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  that is an account balance plan (as defined in Sec. 1.409A- 1(c)(2)(i)(A)), equals the portion of the service provider's account  balance as of December 31, 2004, the right to which was earned and  vested (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) as of December  31, 2004, plus any future contributions to the account, the right to  which was earned and vested (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section) as of December 31, 2004, to the extent such contributions are  actually made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Equity-based compensation plans. For purposes of determining  the amounts deferred before January 1, 2005, under an equity-based  compensation plan, the rules of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section  governing account balance plans are applied except that the account  balance is deemed to be the amount of the payment available to the  service provider on December 31, 2004 (or that would be available to the  service provider if the right were immediately exercisable) the right to  which is earned and vested (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section) as of December 31, 2004. For this purpose, the payment  available to the service provider excludes any exercise price or other  amount that must be paid by the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Earnings. Earnings on amounts deferred under a plan before  January 1,   2005, include only income (whether actual or notional) attributable to  the amounts deferred under a plan as of December 31, 2004, or to such  income. For example, notional interest earned under the plan on amounts  deferred in an account balance plan as of December 31, 2004, generally  will be treated as earnings on amounts deferred under the plan before  January 1, 2005. Similarly, an increase in the amount of payment  available pursuant to a stock option, stock appreciation right, or other  equity-based compensation above the amount of payment available as of  December 31, 2004, due to appreciation in the underlying stock after  December 31, 2004, or accrual of other earnings such as dividends, is  treated as earnings on the amount deferred. In the case of a nonaccount  balance plan, earnings include the increase, due solely to the passage  of time, in the present value of the future payments to which the  service provider has obtained a legally binding right, the present value  of which constituted the amounts deferred under the plan before January  1, 2005. Thus, for each year, there will be an increase (determined  using the same interest rate used to determine the amounts deferred  under the plan before January 1, 2005) resulting from the shortening of  the discount period before the future payments are made, plus, if  applicable, an increase in the present value resulting from the service  provider's survivorship during the year. However, an increase in the  potential benefits under a nonaccount balance plan due to, for example,  an application of an increase in compensation after December 31, 2004,  to a final average pay plan or subsequent eligibility for an early  retirement subsidy, does not constitute earnings on the amounts deferred  under the plan before January 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Definition of plan. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and  (3) of this section, the term ``plan'' has the meaning provided in Sec.  1.409A-1(c), except that the plan aggregation rules do not apply for  purposes of the actuarial assumptions and methods used in paragraph  (a)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, different reasonable actuarial  assumptions and methods may be used to calculate the amounts deferred by  a service provider in two different agreements, methods, programs, or  other arrangements each of which constitutes a nonaccount balance plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The establishment of or contributions to a trust or other  arrangement from which benefits under the plan are to be paid is not a  material modification of the plan, provided that the contribution to the  trust or other arrangement would not otherwise cause an amount to be  includible in the service provider's gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The modification of a provision requiring the immediate  cancellation of a current deferral election, to require the cancellation  of deferrals for the same length of time beginning with the first date  at which the application of such cancellation would not violate section  409A (for example, the first date of the service provider's first  taxable year following the cancellation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Compliance with a domestic relations order (as defined in Sec.  1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii)) with respect to payments to an individual other than  the service provider, or an amendment to a plan to require compliance  with a domestic relations order with respect to payments to an  individual other than the service provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The modification of a plan providing a life annuity form of  payment to permit an election between the existing life annuity form of  payment and other forms of annuity payments that would be treated as a  single form of payment with the existing life annuity form of payment  under Sec. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The modification of a grandfathered plan to add a limited  cashout feature consistent with Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v) (exception to  prohibition on accelerated payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the grant of an  additional benefit under an existing plan that consists of a deferral of  additional compensation not otherwise provided under the plan as of  October 3, 2004, will be treated as a material modification of the plan  only as to the additional deferral of compensation, if the plan  explicitly identifies the additional deferral of compensation and  provides that the additional deferral of compensation is subject to  section 409A. Accordingly, amendments to conform a plan to the  requirements of section 409A with respect to deferrals under a plan  occurring after December 31, 2004, will not constitute a material  modification of the plan with respect to amounts deferred that are  earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004, provided that there is  no concurrent material modification with respect to the amount of, or  rights to, amounts deferred that were earned and vested on or before  December 31, 2004. Similarly, a grant of an additional benefit under a  new plan adopted after October 3, 2004, and before January 1, 2005, will  not be treated as a material modification of an existing plan to the  extent that the new plan explicitly identifies additional deferrals of  compensation and provides that the additional deferrals of compensation  are subject to section 409A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Suspension or termination of a plan. A cessation of deferrals  under, or termination of, a plan, pursuant to the provisions of such  plan, is not a material modification. Amending a plan to provide  participants an election whether to terminate participation in a plan  generally constitutes a material modification of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Changes to investment measures--account balance plans. With  respect to an account balance plan (as defined in   Sec. 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A)), it is not a material modification to change  a notional investment measure to, or to add to an existing investment  measure, an investment measure that qualifies as a predetermined actual  investment within the meaning of Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2) of this  chapter or, for any given taxable year, reflects a reasonable rate of  interest (determined in accordance with Sec. 31.3121(v)(2)- 1(d)(2)(i)(C) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Rescission of modifications. Any modification to the terms of a  plan that would inadvertently result in treatment as a material  modification under this section is not considered a material  modification of the plan to the extent the modification in the terms of  the plan is rescinded by the earlier of a date before the right is  exercised (if the change grants a discretionary right) or the last day  of the taxable year of the service provider during which such change  occurred. Thus, for example, if a service recipient modifies the terms  of a plan on March 1 to allow an individual employee to elect a new  change in the time or form of payment without realizing that such a  change constituted a material modification that would subject the plan  to the requirements of section 409A, and the modification is rescinded  on November 1, then if no change in the time or form of payment has been  made pursuant to the modification before November 1, the plan is not  considered materially modified under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Definition of plan.

For  purposes of section 409(p) and this section, a prohibited allocation  means an impermissible accrual or an impermissible allocation. Whether  there is impermissible accrual is determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)  of this section and whether there is an impermissible allocation is  determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. The amount of  the prohibited allocation is equal to the sum of the amount of the  impermissible accrual plus the amount of the impermissible allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Impermissible accrual. There is an impermissible accrual to the  extent that employer securities consisting of stock in an S corporation  owned by the ESOP and any assets attributable thereto are held under the  ESOP for the benefit of a disqualified person during a nonallocation  year. For this purpose, assets attributable to stock in an S corporation  owned by an ESOP include any distributions, within the meaning of  section 1368, made on S corporation stock held in a disqualified  person's account in the ESOP (including earnings thereon), plus any  proceeds from the sale of S corporation securities held for a  disqualified person's account in the ESOP (including any earnings  thereon). Thus, in the event of a nonallocation year, all S corporation  shares and all other ESOP assets attributable to S corporation stock,  including distributions, sales proceeds, and earnings on either  distributions or proceeds, held for the account of such disqualified  person in the ESOP during that year are an impermissible accrual for the  benefit of that person, whether attributable to contributions in the  current year or in prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Impermissible allocation. An impermissible allocation occurs  during a nonallocation year to the extent that a contribution or other  annual addition (within the meaning of section 415(c)(2)) is made with  respect to the account of a disqualified person, or the disqualified  person otherwise accrues additional benefits, directly or indirectly  under the ESOP or any other plan of the employer qualified under section  401(a) (including a release and allocation of assets from a suspense  account, as described at Sec. 54.4975-11(c) and (d) of this chapter)  that, for the nonallocation year, would have been added to the account  of the disqualified person under the ESOP and invested in employer  securities consisting of stock in an S corporation owned by the ESOP but  for a provision in the ESOP that precludes such addition to the account  of the disqualified person, and investment in employer securities during  a nonallocation year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> is not an actual distribution from the  ESOP. Thus, the amount of the prohibited allocation is not an eligible  rollover distribution under section 402(c). However, for purposes of  applying sections 72 and 402 with respect to any subsequent distribution  from the ESOP, the amount that the disqualified person previously took  into account as income as a result of the deemed distribution is treated  as investment in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other effects. If there is a prohibited allocation, then the  plan fails to satisfy the requirements of section 4975(e)(7) and ceases  to be an ESOP. In such a case, the exemption from the excise tax on  prohibited transactions for loans to leveraged ESOPs contained in  section 4975(d)(3) would cease to apply to any loan (with the result  that the employer would owe an excise tax with respect to the previously  exempt loan). As a result of these failures, the plan would lose the  prohibited transaction exemption for loans to an ESOP under section  4975(d)(3) of the Code and section 408(b)(3) of title I of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). Finally, a  plan that does not operate in accordance with its terms to reflect  section 409(p) fails to satisfy the qualification requirements of  section 401(a), which would cause the corporation's S election to  terminate under section 1362. See also section 4979A(a) which imposes an  excise tax in certain events, including a prohibited allocation under  section 409(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) are illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation M, an S corporation under section  1361, establishes Plan P as an ESOP in 2006, with a calendar plan year.  Plan P is a qualified plan that includes terms providing that a  prohibited allocation will not occur during a nonallocation year in  accordance with section 409(p). On December 31, 2006, all of the 1,000  outstanding shares of stock of Corporation M, with a fair market value  of $30 per share, are contributed to Plan P and allocated among accounts  established within Plan P for the benefit of Corporation M's three  employees, individuals A, B, and C, based on their compensation for  2006. As a result, on December 31, 2006, participant A's account  includes 800 of the shares ($24,000); participant B's account includes  140 of the shares ($4,200); and participant C's account includes the  remaining 60 shares ($1,800). The plan year 2006 is a nonallocation  year, participants A and B are disqualified persons on December 31,  2006, and a prohibited allocation occurs for A and B on December 31,  2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. On December 31, 2006, participants A and B each  have a deemed distribution as a result of the prohibited allocation,  resulting in income of $24,000 for participant A and $4,200 for  participant B. Corporation M owes an excise tax under section 4979A,  based on an amount involved of $28,200. Plan P ceases to be an ESOP on  the date of the prohibited allocation (December 31, 2006) and also fails  to satisfy the qualification requirements of section 401(a) on that date  due to the failure to comply with the provisions requiring compliance  with section 409(p). As a result of having an ineligible shareholder  under section 1361(b)(1)(B), Corporation M ceases to be an S corporation  under section 1361 on December 31, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A))</em> to be transferred into a separate portion of the plan that  is not an ESOP, as described in Sec. 54.4975-11(a)(5) of this chapter,  or to another plan of the employer that satisfies the requirements of  section 401(a) and that is not an ESOP. Any such transfer must be  effectuated by an affirmative action taken no later than the date of the  transfer, and all subsequent actions (including benefit statements)  generally must be consistent with the transfer having occurred on that  date. In the event of such a transfer involving S corporation  securities, the recipient plan is subject to tax on unrelated business  taxable income under section 512.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, if a transfer described in paragraph  (b)(2)(v)(A) of this section is   made from an ESOP to a separate portion of the plan or to another  qualified plan of the employer that is not an ESOP, then both the ESOP  and the plan or portion of a plan that is not an ESOP do not fail to  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 merely because of the  transfer. Further, subsequent to the transfer, that plan will not fail  to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 merely because of the  benefits, rights, and features with respect to the transferred benefits  if those benefits, rights, and features would satisfy the requirements  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 if the mandatory disaggregation rule for ESOPs at  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(2) did not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General definition.

The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An S corporation has 800 outstanding shares,  of which 100 are owned by individual O and 700 are held in an employee  stock ownership plan (ESOP) during 2006, including 200 shares held in  the ESOP account of O, 65 shares held in the ESOP account of participant  P, 65 shares held in the ESOP account of participant Q who is P's  spouse, and 14 shares held in the ESOP account of R, who is the daughter  of P   and Q. There are no unallocated suspense account shares in the ESOP. The  S corporation has no synthetic equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, O is a  disqualified person during 2006 because O's account in the ESOP holds at  least 10% of the shares owned by the ESOP (200 is 28.6% of 700). During  2006, neither P, Q, nor R is a disqualified person under paragraph  (d)(1)(i) of this section, because each of their accounts holds less  than 10% of the shares owned by the ESOP. However, each of P, Q, and R  is a disqualified person under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section  because P and members of P's family own at least 20% of the deemed-owned  ESOP shares (144 (the sum of 65, 65 and 14) is 20.6% of 700). As a  result, disqualified persons own at least 50% of the outstanding shares  of the S corporation during 2006 (O's 100 directly owned shares, O's 200  deemed-owned shares, P's 65 deemed-owned shares, Q's 65 deemed-owned  shares, and R's 14 deemed-owned shares are 55.5% of 800).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An S corporation has shares that are owned by  an ESOP and various individuals. Individuals S and T are married and  have a son, U. Individuals V and W are married and have a daughter, X.  Individuals U and X are married. Individual V has a brother Y. Their  percentages of the deemed-owned ESOP shares of the S corporation are as  follows: T has 6%; U has 7%; and V has 8%. Neither S, W, X, nor Y has  any deemed-owned ESOP shares and the S corporation has no synthetic  equity. However, individual S and individual Y each own directly a  number of shares of the outstanding shares of the S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this example, individual U is a disqualified  person under paragraph (d)(1) of this section (because U's family  consists of S, T, U, V, W, and X, and, in the aggregate, those persons  own more than 20% of the deemed-owned ESOP shares) and individual X is  also a disqualified person under paragraph (d)(1) of this section  (because T's family consists of S, T, U, V, W, and X, and, in the  aggregate, those persons own more than 20% of the deemed-owned ESOP  shares). Further, individuals T and V are each a disqualified person  under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because each is a member of a  family that includes one or more disqualified persons and each has  deemed-owned ESOP shares. However, individuals S, W, and Y are not  disqualified persons under this paragraph (d). For example, S does not  own more than 10% of the deemed-owned ESOP shares, and S's family, which  consists of S, T, U, and X, owns, in the aggregate, only 13% of the  deemed-owned ESOP shares (X's parents are not members of S's family  because the family members of a person do not include the parents-in-law  of the person's descendants). Further, note that, for purposes of  determining whether the ESOP has a nonallocation year under paragraph  (c) of this section, the shares directly owned by S and Y would be taken  into account as shares owned by disqualified persons under the  attribution rules in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Deemed-owned ESOP shares. For purposes of section 409(p) and  this section, a person is treated as owning his or her deemed-owned ESOP  shares. Deemed-owned ESOP shares owned by a person mean, with respect to  any person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any shares of stock in the S corporation constituting employer  securities that are allocated to such person's account under the ESOP;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such person's share of the stock in the S corporation that is  held by the ESOP but is not allocated to the account of any participant  or beneficiary (with such person's share to be determined in the same  proportion as the shares released and allocated from a suspense account,  as described at Sec. 54.4975-11(c) and (d) of the Excise Tax  Regulations, under the ESOP for the most recently ended plan year for  which there were shares released and allocated from a suspense account,  or if there has been no such prior release and allocation from a  suspense account, then determined in proportion to a reasonable estimate  of the shares that would be released and allocated in the first year of  a loan repayment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Synthetic equity and rights to acquire stock of the S  corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ownership of synthetic equity. For purposes of section  409(p) and this section, synthetic equity means the rights described in  paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Synthetic equity is treated as owned  by the person that has any of the rights specified in paragraph (f)(2)  of the section. In addition, the attribution rules as set forth in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply for purposes of attributing  ownership of synthetic equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Synthetic equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rights to acquire stock of the S  corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Synthetic equity includes any stock  option, warrant, restricted stock, deferred issuance stock right, stock  appreciation right payable in stock, or similar interest or right that  gives the holder the right to acquire or receive stock of the S  corporation in the future. Rights to acquire stock in an S   corporation with respect to stock that is, at all times during the  period when such rights are effective, both issued and outstanding, and  held by a person other than the ESOP, the S corporation, or a related  entity are not synthetic equity but only if that person is subject to  federal income taxes. (See also paragraph (c)(4) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> does not apply if, based on the facts and circumstances,  the Commissioner finds that the right to acquire stock held by the ESOP  constitutes an avoidance or an evasion of section 409(p). See also  section 408(d) of ERISA, under which the exemption provided by section  408(e) of ERISA (and the related exemption at section 4975(d)(13) of the  Code) does not apply to an owner-employee, including an employee or  officer of an S corporation who is a 5 percent owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain stock rights. Synthetic equity also  includes a right to a future payment (payable in cash or any other form  other than stock of the S corporation) from an S corporation that is  based on the value of the stock of the S corporation, such as  appreciation in such value. Thus, for example, synthetic equity includes  a stock appreciation right with respect to stock of an S corporation  that is payable in cash or a phantom stock unit with respect to stock of  an S corporation that is payable in cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rights to acquire interests in or assets of an S corporation  or a related entity. Synthetic equity includes a right to acquire stock  or other similar interests in a related entity to the extent of the S  corporation's ownership. Synthetic equity also includes a right to  acquire assets of an S corporation or a related entity other than either  rights to acquire goods, services, or property at fair market value in  the ordinary course of business or fringe benefits excluded from gross  income under section 132.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for nonqualified deferred compensation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Synthetic equity also includes any of the following with respect to an S  corporation or a related entity: any remuneration to which section  404(a)(5) applies; remuneration for which a deduction would be permitted  under section 404(a)(5) if separate accounts were maintained; any right  to receive property, as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(e) of the Income Tax  Regulations (including a payment to a trust described in section 402(b)  or to an annuity described in section 403(c)) in a future year for the  performance of services; any transfer of property in connection with the  performance of services to which section 83 applies to the extent that  the property is not substantially vested within the meaning of Sec.  1.83-3(i) by the end of the plan year in which transferred; and a split- dollar life insurance arrangement under Sec. 1.61-22(b) entered into in  connection with the performance of services (other than one under which,  at all times, the only economic benefit that will be provided under the  arrangement is current life insurance protection as described in Sec.  1.61-22(d)(3)). Synthetic equity also includes any other remuneration  for services under a plan, method, or arrangement deferring the receipt  of compensation to a date that is after the 15th day of the 3rd calendar  month after the end of the entity's taxable year in which the related  services are rendered. However, synthetic equity does not include  benefits under a plan that is an eligible retirement plan within the  meaning of section 402(c)(8)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of applying paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section  with respect to an ESOP, synthetic equity does not include any interest  described in such paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section to the extent  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The interest is nonqualified deferred compensation (within the  meaning of section 3121(v)(2)) that was outstanding on December 17,  2004;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)-1(d)</em> of this chapter) prior to  January 1, 2005, for purposes of taxation under chapter 21 of the  Internal Revenue Code (or income attributable thereto); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The interest was held before the first date on which the ESOP  acquires any employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No overlap among shares of deemed-owned ESOP shares or synthetic  equity. Synthetic equity under this paragraph (f)(2) does not include  shares that are deemed-owned ESOP shares (or any rights with respect to  deemed-owned ESOP shares to the extent such rights are specifically  provided under section 409(h)). In addition, synthetic equity under a  specific subparagraph of this paragraph (f)(2) does not include anything  that is synthetic equity under a preceding provision of paragraph  (f)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Number of synthetic shares--(i) Synthetic equity determined by  reference to S corporation shares. In the case of synthetic equity that  is determined by reference to shares of stock of the S corporation, the  person who is entitled to the synthetic equity is treated as owning the  number of shares of stock deliverable pursuant to such synthetic equity.  In the case of synthetic equity that is determined by reference to  shares of stock of the S corporation, but for which payment is made in  cash or other property (besides stock of the S corporation), the number  of shares of synthetic equity treated as owned is equal to the number of  shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the cash or other  property (disregarding lapse restrictions as described in Sec. 1.83- 3(i)). Where such synthetic equity is a right to purchase or receive S  corporation shares, the corresponding number of shares of synthetic  equity is determined without regard to lapse restrictions as described  in Sec. 1.83-3</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> or to any amount required to be paid in exchange for  the shares. Thus, for example, if a corporation grants an employee of an  S corporation an option to purchase 100 shares of the corporation's  stock, exercisable in the future only after the satisfaction of certain  performance conditions, the employee is the deemed owner of 100  synthetic equity shares of the corporation as of the date the option is  granted. If the same employee were granted 100 shares of restricted S  corporation stock (or restricted stock units), subject to forfeiture  until the satisfaction of performance or service conditions, the  employee would likewise be the deemed owner of 100 synthetic equity  shares from the grant date. However, if the same employee were granted a  stock appreciation right with regard to 100 shares of S corporation  stock (whether payable in stock or in cash), the number of synthetic  equity shares the employee is deemed to own equals the number of shares  having a value equal to the appreciation at the time of measurement  (determined without regard to lapse restrictions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Synthetic equity determined by reference to shares in a related  entity. In the case of synthetic equity that is determined by reference  to shares of stock (or similar interests) in a related entity, the  person who is entitled to the synthetic equity is treated as owning  shares of stock of the S corporation with the same aggregate value as  the number of shares of stock (or similar interests) of the related  entity (with such value determined without regard to any lapse  restriction as defined at Sec. 1.83-3(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other synthetic equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. In the case of any  synthetic equity to which neither paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section  nor paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section apply, the person who is  entitled to the synthetic equity is treated as owning on any date a  number of shares of stock in the S corporation equal to the present  value (on that date) of the synthetic equity (with such value determined  without regard to any lapse restriction as defined at   Sec. 1.83-3(i)) divided by the fair market value of a share of the S  corporation's stock as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use of annual or more frequent determination dates. A year is a  nonallocation year if the thresholds in paragraph (c) of this section  are met at any time during that year. However, for purposes of this  paragraph (f)(4)(iii), an ESOP may provide that the number of shares of  S corporation stock treated as owned by a person who is entitled to  synthetic equity to which this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies is  determined annually (or more frequently), as of the first day of the  ESOP's plan year or as of any other reasonable determination date or  dates during a plan year. If the ESOP so provides, the number of shares  of synthetic equity to which this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies that are  treated as owned by that person for any period from a given  determination date through the date immediately preceding the next  following determination date is the number of shares treated as owned on  the given determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Use of triennial recalculations. (1) Although an ESOP must have  a determination date that is no less frequent than annually, if the  terms of the ESOP so provide, then the number of shares of synthetic  equity with respect to grants of synthetic equity to which this  paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies may be fixed for a specified period from a  determination date identified under the ESOP through the day before a  determination date that is not later than the third anniversary of the  identified determination date. Thus, the ESOP must provide for the  number of shares of synthetic equity to which this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)  applies to be re-determined not less frequently than every three years,  based on the S corporation share value on a determination date that is  not later than the third anniversary of the identified determination  date and the aggregate present value of the synthetic equity to which  this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies (including all grants made during the  three-year period) on that determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> However, additional accruals, allocations, or grants (to which  this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies) that are made during such three-year  period are taken into account on each determination date during that  period, based on the number of synthetic equity shares resulting from  the additional accrual, allocation, or grant (determined as of the  determination date on or next following the date of the accrual,  allocation, or grant). See Example 3 of paragraph (h) of this section  for an example illustrating this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If, as permitted under this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C), an ESOP  provides for the number of shares of synthetic equity to be fixed for a  specified period from a determination date to a subsequent determination  date, then that subsequent determination date can be changed to a new  determination date, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The change in the subsequent determination date must be  effectuated through a plan amendment adopted before the new  determination date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The new determination date must be earlier than the prior  determination date (that is, the new determination date must be earlier  than the determination date applicable in the absence of the plan  amendment);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(C)(2)</em> of this section  must be satisfied measured from the new determination date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except to the extent permitted by the Commissioner in revenue  rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), the change  must be adopted in connection with either a change in the plan year of  the ESOP or a merger, consolidation, or transfer of plan assets of the  ESOP under section 414(l) (and the new determination date must  consistent with that plan year change or section 414(l) event).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)(C)(1)</em> of this section which are consistently used by the  ESOP for all persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the number of synthetic  shares treated as owned by B under this paragraph (f)(4) is decreased  from 100 to 75 (because the ESOP only owns 75 percent of the outstanding  stock of the S corporation, rather than 100 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for shares with greater voting power than ESOP  shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (f)(4), if  a synthetic equity right includes (directly or indirectly) a right to  purchase or receive shares of S corporation stock that have per-share  voting rights greater than the per-share voting rights of one or more  shares of S corporation stock held by the ESOP, then the number of  shares of deemed owned synthetic equity attributable to such right is  not less than the number of shares that would have the same voting  rights if the shares had the same per-share voting rights as shares held  by the ESOP with the least voting rights. For example, if shares of S  corporation stock held by the ESOP have one voting right per share, then  an individual who holds an option to purchase one share with 100 voting  rights is treated as owning 100 shares of synthetic equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Avoidance or evasion of section 409(p) involving synthetic  equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section sets forth a  standard for determining whether the principal purpose of the ownership  structure of an S corporation involving synthetic equity constitutes an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p). Paragraph (g)(3) of this section  identifies certain specific ownership structures that constitute an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p). See also paragraph (c)(3) of  this section for a rule under which the ownership structures in  paragraph (g)(3) of this section result in a nonallocation year for  purposes of section 409(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standard for determining when there is an avoidance or evasion  of section 409(p) involving synthetic equity. For purposes of section  409(p) and this section, whether the principal purpose of the ownership  structure of an S corporation involving synthetic equity constitutes an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p) is determined by taking into  account all the surrounding facts and circumstances, including all  features of the ownership of the S corporation's outstanding stock and  related obligations (including synthetic equity), any shareholders who  are taxable entities, and the cash distributions made to shareholders,  to determine whether, to the extent of the ESOP's stock ownership, the  ESOP receives the economic benefits of ownership in the S corporation  that occur during the period that stock of the S corporation is owned by  the ESOP. Among the factors indicating that the ESOP receives those  economic benefits include shareholder voting rights, the right to  receive distributions made to shareholders, and the right to benefit  from the profits earned by the S corporation, including the extent to  which actual distributions of profits are made from the S corporation to  the ESOP and the extent to which the ESOP's ownership interest in  undistributed profits and future profits is subject to dilution as a  result of synthetic equity. For example, the ESOP's ownership interest  is not subject to dilution if the total amount of synthetic equity is a  relatively small portion of the total number of shares and deemed-owned  shares of the S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specific transactions that constitute an avoidance or evasion of  section 409(p) involving segregated profits. Taking into account the  standard in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the principal purpose of  the ownership structure of an S corporation constitutes an avoidance or  evasion of section 409(p) in any case in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The profits of the S corporation generated by the business  activities of a specific individual or individuals are not provided to  the ESOP, but are instead substantially accumulated and held for the  benefit of the individual or individuals on a tax-deferred basis within  an entity related to the S corporation, such as a partnership, trust, or  corporation (such as in a subsidiary that is a disregarded entity), or  any other method that has the same effect of segregating profits for the  benefit of such individual or individuals (such as nonqualified deferred  compensation described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual or individuals for whom profits are segregated  have rights to acquire 50 percent or more of those profits directly or  indirectly (for example, by purchase of the subsidiary); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonallocation year would occur if this section were  separately applied with respect to either the separate entity or  whatever method has the effect of segregating profits of the individual  or individuals, treating such entity as a separate S corporation owned  by an ESOP (or in the case of any other method of segregation of profits  by treating those profits as the only assets of a separate S corporation  owned by an ESOP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples.

Individual E's  synthetic equity shares are counted in determining whether E is a  disqualified person for 2006, and individual F's synthetic equity shares  are counted in determining whether F is a disqualified person for 2006.  Applying the rule of paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, E's option to  acquire 110 shares of the S corporation converts under paragraph  (f)(4)(iv) of this section, into 91.7 shares of synthetic equity (110  times the ratio of the 1,000 deemed-owned ESOP shares to the sum of the  1,000 deemed-owned ESOP shares plus the 200 shares held outside the ESOP  by A and B). Similarly, F's option to acquire 130 shares of the S  corporation converts into 108.3 shares of synthetic equity (130 times  the ratio of the 1,000 deemed-owned ESOP shares to the sum of the 1,000  deemed-owned ESOP shares plus the 200 shares held outside the ESOP by A  and B). However, the synthetic equity shares owned by any person do not  affect the calculation for any other person's ownership of shares.  Accordingly, as shown in column 6 in the table contained in paragraph  (i) of Example 2, individuals B, C, E, and F are disqualified persons  for 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conclusion with respect to nonallocation year. The 100 shares  owned directly by B, B's 330 deemed-owned ESOP shares, C's 145 deemed- owned ESOP shares, E's 30 deemed-owned ESOP shares, E's 91.7 synthetic  equity shares, F's 20 deemed-owned ESOP shares, plus F's 108.3 synthetic  equity shares total 825, which equals 58.9% of 1,400, which is the sum  of the 1,200 outstanding shares of X and the 200 shares of synthetic  equity shares of X held by disqualified persons. Thus, 2006 is a  nonallocation year for X's ESOP under section 409(p) because  disqualified persons own at least 50% of the total shares of outstanding  stock of X and the total synthetic equity shares of X held by  disqualified persons. In addition, independent of the preceding  conclusion, 2006 would be a nonallocation year because disqualified  persons own at least 50% of X's outstanding shares because the 100  shares owned directly by B, B's 330 deemed-owned ESOP shares, C's 145  deemed-owned ESOP shares, E's 30 deemed-owned ESOP shares, plus F's 20  deemed-owned ESOP shares equal 52.1% of the 1,200 outstanding shares of  X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The grant made on January 1, 2005, is treated as  100 shares until the determination date in 2008. The grant made on March  1, 2005, is not taken into account until the 2006 determination date and  its present value on that date, along with the then present value of the  grant made on December 31, 2005, is treated as a number of shares that  are based on the $8 per share value on the 2006 determination date, with  the resulting number of shares continuing to apply until the  determination date in 2008. On the January 1, 2008, determination date,  the grant made on the preceding day is taken into account at its present  value of $3,000 on January 1, 2008 and the $15 per share value on that  date with the resulting number of shares (200) continuing to apply until  the next determination date. In addition, on the January 1, 2008,  determination date, the number of shares determined under other grants  made between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007, must be revalued.  Accordingly, the aggregate value of all nonqualified deferred  compensation granted during that period is determined to be $3750 on  January 1, 2008, and the corresponding number of shares of synthetic  equity based on the $15 per share value is determined to be 250 shares  on the 2008 determination date, with the resulting aggregate number of  shares (450) continuing to apply until the determination date in 2011.  On the January 1, 2011, determination date, the aggregate value of all  nonqualified deferred compensation is determined to be $7,600 and the  corresponding number of shares of synthetic equity based on the $20 per  share value on the 2011 determination date is determined to be 380  shares (with the resulting number of shares continuing to apply until  the day before the determination date in 2014, assuming no further  grants are made).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Statutory effective date.

For plan years beginning before  January 1, 2006, Sec. 1.409(p)-1T (as it appeared in the April 1, 2005,  edition of 26 CFR part 1) applies.  [T.D. 9302, 71 FR 76137, Dec. 20, 2006]    Sec. 1.409(p)-1T  Prohibited allocations of securities in an S  corporation (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Organization of this section. Section 409(p) applies if a  nonallocation year occurs in an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), as  defined in section 4975(e)(7), that holds shares of stock of an S  corporation, as defined in section 1361, that are employer securities as  defined in section 409(l). Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the  general rule under section 409(p)(1) and (2) prohibiting any accrual or  allocation to a disqualified person in a nonallocation year. Paragraph  (c) of this   section sets forth rules under section 409(p)(3), (5), and (7) for  determining whether a year is a nonallocation year, generally based on  whether disqualified persons own at least 50 percent of the shares of  the S corporation, either taking into account only the outstanding  shares of the S corporation (including shares held by the ESOP) or  taking into account both the outstanding shares and synthetic equity of  the S corporation. Paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section contain  definitions of disqualified person under section 409(p)(4) and (5),  deemed-owned ESOP shares under section 409(p)(4)(C), and synthetic  equity under section 409(p)(6)(C). Paragraph (g) of this section  contains a standard for determining when the principal purpose of the  ownership structure of an S corporation constitutes an avoidance or  evasion of section 409(p). The definitions used in section 409(p) and  this section are also applicable for purposes of section 4979A, which  imposes an excise tax on certain events, including a nonallocation year  under section 409(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prohibited allocation in a nonallocation year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  An ESOP holding employer securities consisting of stock in an S  corporation must provide that no portion of the assets of the plan  attributable to (or allocable in lieu of) such employer securities may,  during a nonallocation year, accrue under the ESOP, or be allocated  directly or indirectly under any plan of the employer (including the  ESOP) meeting the requirements of section 401(a), for the benefit of any  disqualified person (a prohibited allocation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prohibited allocation definition. For  purposes of section 409(p)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  there is a prohibited allocation (i.e., assets accrue or are allocated  as prohibited under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) if there is either  an impermissible accrual as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section or an impermissible allocation as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section. The amount of the prohibited allocation is  equal to the sum of the impermissible accrual plus the amount of the  impermissible allocation (if any).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Impermissible accrual. There is an impermissible accrual to the  extent (and only to the extent) that employer securities consisting of  stock in an S corporation owned by the ESOP and any assets attributable  thereto are held under the ESOP for the benefit of a disqualified person  during a nonallocation year. For this purpose, assets attributable to S  corporation securities include any distributions, within the meaning of  section 1368, made on S corporation stock held in a disqualified  person's account in the ESOP (including earnings thereon), plus any  proceeds from the sale of S corporation securities held for a  disqualified person's account in the ESOP (including any earnings  thereon). Thus, for example, in the event of a nonallocation year, all S  corporation shares and all other ESOP assets attributable to S  corporation stock, including distributions, sales proceeds, and earnings  on either the distribution or proceeds, held for the account of such  disqualified person in the ESOP during that year are an impermissible  accrual for the benefit of that person, whether attributable to  contributions in the current year or in prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Impermissible allocation. An impermissible allocation means  any allocation for a disqualified person directly or indirectly under  any plan of the employer qualified under section 401(a) that occurs  during a nonallocation year to the extent that a contribution or other  annual addition is made, or the disqualified person otherwise accrues  additional benefits, under the ESOP or any other plan of the employer  qualified under section 401(a) (including a release and allocation of  assets from a suspense account, as described at Sec. 54.4975-11(c) and  (d) of this chapter) that, for the nonallocation year, would otherwise  have been added to the account of the disqualified person under the ESOP  and invested in employer securities consisting of stock in an S  corporation owned by the ESOP but for a provision in the ESOP to comply  with section 409(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> is not an actual distribution from the ESOP.  Thus, the amount of the prohibited allocation is not an eligible  rollover distribution under section 402(c). However, for purposes of  applying sections 72 and 402 with respect to any subsequent distribution  from the ESOP, the amount that the disqualified person previously took  into account as income as a result of the deemed distribution is treated  as an investment in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other effects. If there is a prohibited allocation, then the  plan fails to satisfy the requirements of section 4975(e)(7) and ceases  to be an ESOP. In such a case, the exemption from the excise tax on  prohibited transactions for loans to leveraged ESOPs contained in  section 4975(d)(3) would cease to apply to any loan (with the result  that the employer would owe an excise tax with respect to the previously  exempt loan) and, further, the exception in section 512(e)(3) would not  apply to the plan (with the result that the plan may owe income tax as a  result of unrelated business taxable income under section 512 with  respect to S corporation stock held by the plan).

Further, subsequent to the transfer,  that plan will not fail to satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-4 merely because of the benefits, rights, or features with  respect to the transferred benefits if those benefits, rights, or  features would satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 if the  mandatory disaggregation rule for ESOPs at Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(2) did  not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonallocation year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition generally.

The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An S corporation has 800 outstanding shares of  which 100 are owned by individual O and 700 are held in an employee  stock ownership plan (ESOP) during 2005, including 200 shares held in  the ESOP account of O, 65 shares held in the ESOP account of participant  P, and 40 shares held in the ESOP account of participant Q who is P's  spouse. The S corporation has no synthetic equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. O is a disqualified person during 2005 because O's  account in the ESOP holds at least 10 percent of the shares owned by the  ESOP (200 is 28.6 percent of 700). In addition, P is a disqualified  person during 2005 because, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, P is  treated as owning the shares held by Q and P's total deemed-owned shares  are thus at least 10 percent of the shares owned by the plan (65 plus 40  is more than 10 percent of 700). In addition, Q is a disqualified person  as a result of the rules in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. As a  result, disqualified persons own at least 50 percent of the outstanding  shares of the S corporation during 2005 (O's 100 directly owned shares,  O's 200 deemed-owned shares, P's 65 deemed-owned shares, plus Q's 40  deemed owned shares are 50.6 percent of 800).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Deemed-owned ESOP shares.

For  purposes of section 409(p) and this section, synthetic equity is treated  as owned by a person in   the same manner as stock is treated as owned by a person, directly or  under the rules of section 318(a)(2) and (3). Synthetic equity means the  rights described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Synthetic equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rights to acquire stock of the S  corporation. Synthetic equity includes any stock option, warrant,  restricted stock, deferred issuance stock right, stock appreciation  right payable in stock, or similar interest or right that gives the  holder the right to acquire or receive stock of the S corporation in the  future. Rights to acquire stock in an S corporation with respect to  stock that is, at all times during the period when such rights are  effective, both issued and outstanding and held by persons (who are  subject to federal income taxes) other than the ESOP, the S corporation,  or a related entity are not synthetic equity (but see paragraph (c)(4)  of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain stock rights. Synthetic equity also  includes a right to a future payment (payable in cash or any other form  other than stock of the S corporation) from an S corporation that is  based on the value of the stock of the S corporation, such as  appreciation in such value. Thus, synthetic equity includes a stock  appreciation right with respect to stock of an S corporation that is  payable in cash or a phantom stock unit with respect to stock of an S  corporation that is payable in cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rights to acquire interests in or assets of an S corporation  or a related entity. Synthetic equity includes a right to acquire stock  or other similar interests in a related entity to the extent of the S  corporation's ownership. Synthetic equity also includes a right to  acquire assets of an S corporation or a related entity other than either  rights to acquire goods, services, or property at fair market value in  the ordinary course of business or fringe benefits excluded from gross  income under section 132.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for nonqualified deferred compensation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Synthetic equity also includes any of the following with respect to an S  corporation or a related entity: any remuneration to which section  404(a)(5) applies; remuneration for which a deduction would be permitted  under section 404(a)(5) if separate accounts were maintained; any right  to receive property to which section 83 applies (including a payment to  a trust described in section 402(b) or to an annuity described in  section 403(c)) in a future year for the performance of services; any  transfer of property (to which section 83 applies) in connection with  the performance of services to the extent that the property is not  substantially vested within the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(i) by the end of  the plan year in which transferred; and a split-dollar life insurance  arrangement under Sec. 1.61-22(b) entered into in connection with the  performance of services (other than one under which, at all times, the  only economic benefit that will be provided under the arrangement is  current life insurance protection as described in Sec. 1.61-22(d)(3)).  Synthetic equity also includes any other remuneration for services under  a plan, or method or arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation  to a date that is after the 15th day of the 3rd calendar month after the  end of the entity's taxable year in which the related services are  rendered. However, synthetic equity does not include benefits under a  plan that is an eligible retirement plan within the meaning of section  402(c)(8)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of applying paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section  with respect to an ESOP, synthetic equity does not include any interest  described in such paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section to the extent  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The interest is nonqualified deferred compensation (within the  meaning of section 3121(v)(2)) that was outstanding on December 17,  2004;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)-1(d)</em> of this chapter) prior to  January 1, 2005, for purposes of taxation under chapter 21 of the  Internal Revenue Code (or income attributable thereto); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The interest was held before the first date on which the ESOP  acquires any employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No overlap among shares of deemed-owned ESOP shares or synthetic  equity. Synthetic equity under this paragraph   (f)(2) does not include shares that are deemed-owned ESOP shares (or any  rights with respect to deemed-owned ESOP shares to the extent such  rights are specifically permitted under section 409(h)). In addition,  synthetic equity under a specific subparagraph of this paragraph (f)(2)  does not include anything that is synthetic equity under paragraph  (f)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Number of synthetic shares--(i) Synthetic equity determined by  reference to S corporation shares. In the case of synthetic equity that  is determined by reference to shares of stock of the S corporation, the  person who is entitled to the synthetic equity is treated as owning the  number of shares of stock deliverable pursuant to such synthetic equity.  In the case of synthetic equity that is determined by reference to  shares of stock of the S corporation, but for which payment is made in  cash or other property (besides stock of the S corporation), the number  of shares of synthetic equity treated as owned is equal to the number of  shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the cash or other  property (disregarding lapse restrictions as described in Sec. 1.83- 3(i)). Where such synthetic equity is a right to purchase or receive S  corporation shares, the corresponding number of shares of synthetic  equity is determined without regard to lapse restrictions as described  in Sec. 1.83-3</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> or to any amount required to be paid in exchange for  the shares. Thus, for example, if a corporation grants an employee of an  S corporation an option to purchase 100 shares of the corporation's  stock, exercisable in the future only after the satisfaction of certain  performance conditions, the employee is the deemed owner of 100  synthetic equity shares of the corporation as of the date the option is  granted. If the same employee were granted 100 shares of restricted S  corporation stock (or restricted stock units), subject to forfeiture  until the satisfaction of performance or service conditions, the  employee would likewise be the deemed owner of 100 synthetic equity  shares from the grant date. However, if the same employee were granted a  stock appreciation right with regard to 100 shares of S corporation  stock (whether payable in stock or in cash), the number of synthetic  equity shares the employee is deemed to own equals the number of shares  having a value equal to the appreciation at the time of measurement  (determined without regard to lapse restrictions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Synthetic equity determined by reference to shares in a related  entity. In the case of synthetic equity that is determined by reference  to shares of stock (or similar interests) in a related entity, the  person who is entitled to the synthetic equity is treated as owning  shares of stock of the S corporation with the same aggregate value as  the number of shares of stock (or similar interests) of the related  entity (with such value determined without regard to any lapse  restriction as defined at Sec. 1.83-3(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other synthetic equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. In the case of any  synthetic equity to which neither paragraph (f)(4)(i) nor paragraph  (f)(4)(ii) of this section apply, the person who is entitled to the  synthetic equity is treated as owning on any date a number of shares of  stock in the S corporation equal to the present value (on that date) of  the synthetic equity (with such value determined without regard to any  lapse restriction as defined at Sec. 1.83-3(i)) divided by the fair  market value of a share of the S corporation's stock as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rules--(1) Use of annual or more frequent determination  dates. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), while the  determination of whether there is a nonallocation year depends on day- by-day determinations under paragraph (c) of this section, the number of  shares of S corporation stock treated as owned by a person who is  entitled to synthetic equity to which this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies  is permitted to be determined only annually (or more frequently), as of  the first day of the ESOP's plan year or as of any other   reasonable determination date or dates during a plan year. If the ESOP  so provides, the number of shares of synthetic equity to which this  paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies that are treated as owned by that person  for any period from a given determination date through the date  immediately preceding the next following determination date is the  number of shares treated as owned on the given determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conditions for application of rules. Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of  this section only applies with respect to grants of synthetic equity to  which this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies. In addition, paragraph  (f)(4)(iii)(B)(1) of this section applies only if the fair market value  of a share of the S corporation securities on any determination date is  not unrepresentative of the value of the S corporation securities  throughout the rest of the plan year and only if the terms of the ESOP  include provisions conforming to paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B)(1) of this  section which are consistently used by the ESOP for all persons. In  addition, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B)(2) of this section applies only if  the terms of the ESOP include provisions conforming to paragraphs  (f)(4)(iii)(B)(1) and (2) of this section which are consistently used by  the ESOP for all persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the number of synthetic shares treated as  owned by B under this paragraph (f)(4) is decreased from 200 to 150  (because the ESOP only owns 75% of the outstanding stock of the S  corporation, rather than 100%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for shares with greater voting power than ESOP  shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (f)(4), if  a synthetic equity right includes (directly or indirectly) a right to  purchase or receive shares of S corporation stock that have per-share  voting rights greater than the per-share voting rights of one or more  shares of S corporation stock held by the ESOP, then the number of  shares of deemed owned synthetic equity attributable to such right is  not less than the number of shares that would have the same voting  rights if the shares had the same per-share voting rights as shares held  by the ESOP   with the least voting rights. For example, if shares of S corporation  stock held by the ESOP have one voting right per share, then an  individual who holds an option to purchase one share with 100 voting  rights is treated as owning 100 shares of synthetic equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Avoidance or evasion of section 409(p) involving synthetic  equity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section sets forth a  standard for determining whether the principal purpose of the ownership  structure of an S corporation involving synthetic equity constitutes an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p). Paragraph (g)(3) of this section  identifies certain specific ownership structures that constitute an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p). See also paragraph (c)(3) of  this section for a rule under which the ownership structures in  paragraph (g)(3) result in a nonallocation year for purposes of section  409(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standard for determining when there is an avoidance or evasion  of section 409(p) involving synthetic equity--For purposes of section  409(p) and this section, whether the principal purpose of the ownership  structure of an S corporation involving synthetic equity constitutes an  avoidance or evasion of section 409(p) is determined by taking into  account all the surrounding facts and circumstances, including all  features of the ownership of the S corporation's outstanding stock and  related obligations (including synthetic equity), any shareholders who  are taxable entities, and the cash distributions made to shareholders,  to determine whether, to the extent of the ESOP's stock ownership, the  ESOP receives the economic benefits of ownership in the S corporation  that occur during the period that stock of the S corporation is owned by  the ESOP. Among the factors indicating that the ESOP receives these  economic benefits include shareholder voting rights, the right to  receive distributions made to shareholders, and the right to benefit  from the profits earned by the S corporation, including the extent to  which actual distributions of profits are made from the S corporation to  the ESOP and the extent to which the ESOP's ownership interest in  undistributed profits and future profits is subject to dilution as a  result of synthetic equity, for example, the ESOP's ownership interest  is not subject to dilution if the total amount of synthetic equity is a  relatively small portion of the total number of shares and deemed-owned  shares of the S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specific transactions that constitute an avoidance or evasion of  section 409(p) involving segregated profits. Taking into account the  standard in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the principal purpose of  the ownership structure of an S corporation constitutes an avoidance or  evasion of section 409(p) in any case in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The profits of the S corporation generated by the business  activities of a specific individual or individuals are not provided to  the ESOP, but are instead substantially accumulated and held for the  benefit of that individual or individuals on a tax-deferred basis within  an entity related to the S corporation, such as a partnership, trust, or  corporation (such as in a subsidiary that is a disregarded entity), or  any other method that has the same effect of segregating profits for the  benefit of such individual or individuals (such as nonqualified deferred  compensation described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual or individuals for whom profits are segregated  have rights to acquire 50 percent or more of those profits directly or  indirectly (for example, by purchase of the subsidiary); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonallocation year would occur if this section were  separately applied with respect to either the separate entity or  whatever method has the effect of segregating profits of the individual  or individuals, treating such entity as a separate S corporation owned  by an ESOP (or in the case of any other method of segregation of profits  by treating those profits as the only assets of a separate S corporation  owned by an ESOP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples.

Similarly, F's option to acquire 130  shares of the S corporation converts into 108.3 shares of synthetic  equity (130 times the ratio of the 1,000 deemed-owned ESOP shares to the  sum of the 1,000 deemed-owned ESOP shares plus the 200 shares held  outside the ESOP by A and B). Accordingly, as shown in column 6 in the  table above, individual E's synthetic equity shares are counted in  determining whether E is a disqualified person for 2006, and individual  F's synthetic equity shares are counted in determining whether F is a  disqualified person for 2006, but the synthetic equity shares owned by  any person do not affect the calculation for any other person's  ownership of shares. Accordingly, individuals B, C, E, and F are  disqualified persons for 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conclusion with respect to nonallocation year. The 100 shares  owned directly by B, B's 330 deemed-owned ESOP shares, C's 145 deemed- owned ESOP shares, E's 30 deemed-owned ESOP shares, E's 91.7 synthetic  equity shares, F's 20 deemed-owned ESOP shares, plus F's 108.3 synthetic  equity shares total 825, which equals 58.9% of 1,400, which is the sum  of the 1,200 outstanding shares of X and the 200 shares of synthetic  equity shares of X held by disqualified persons. Thus, 2006 is a   nonallocation year for X's ESOP under section 409(p) because  disqualified persons own at least 50% of the total shares of outstanding  stock of X and the total synthetic equity shares of X held by  disqualified persons. In addition, independent of the preceding  conclusion, 2006 would be a nonallocation year because disqualified  persons own at least 50% of X's outstanding shares because the 100  shares owned directly by B, B's 330 deemed-owned ESOP shares, C's 145  deemed-owned ESOP shares, E's 30 deemed-owned ESOP shares, plus F's 20  deemed-owned ESOP shares equal 52.1% of the 1,200 outstanding shares of  X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation Y is a calendar year S  corporation that maintains an ESOP. Y has a single class of common  stock, of which there are a total of 1,000 shares outstanding, all of  which are owned by the ESOP. Y has no synthetic equity, except for four  grants of nonqualified deferred compensation that are made to an  individual during the period from 2005 through 2011, as set forth in  column 2 in the following table, and the ESOP uses the special rules in  paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section to determine the number of shares  of synthetic equity owned by that individual, as shown in columns 4 and  5:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">5 Aggregate</p><p class="depth0">4 New shares      number of</p><p class="depth0">2 Present value of                           of synthetic      synthetic</p><p class="depth0">1 Determination date         nonqualified deferred     3 Share value on       equity on     equity shares</p><p class="depth0">compenstion on       determination date    determination        on</p><p class="depth0">determination date                               date        determination</p><p class="depth0">date ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- January 1, 2005...................

The grant made on January 1, 2005, is treated as  100 shares until the determination date in 2008. The grant made on March  1, 2005, is not taken into account until the 2006 determination date and  its present value on that date, along with the then present value of the  grant made on the preceding day, is treated as a number of shares that  are based on the $8 per share value on the 2006 determination date, with  the resulting number of shares continuing to apply until the  determination date in 2008. On the January 1, 2008, determination date,  the grant made on the preceding day is taken into account at its present  value of $3,000 on January 1, 2008 and the $15 per share value on that  date with the resulting number of shares (200) continuing to apply until  the next determination date. In addition, on the January 1, 2008,  determination date, the number of shares determined under other grants  made between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007, must be revalued.  Accordingly, the aggregate value of all nonqualified deferred  compensation granted during that period is determined to be $3750 on  January 1, 2008, and the corresponding number of shares of synthetic  equity based on the $15 per share value is determined to be 250 shares  on the 2008 determination date, with the resulting aggregate number of  shares (450) continuing to apply until the determination date in 2011.  On the January 1, 2011, determination date, the aggregate value of all  nonqualified deferred compensation is determined to be $7,600 and the  corresponding number of shares of synthetic equity based on the $20 per  share value on the 2011 determination date is determined to be 380  shares   (with the resulting number of shares continuing to apply until the  determination date in 2014, assuming no further grants are made).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Statutory effective date.

For this purpose, there is no reasonable likelihood that the  holder of the right will receive the shares (or equivalent value) in any  case in which the option is based on an exercise price that is more than  200% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant or the  right (in the case of a stock appreciation right or similar right to  acquire shares of the S corporation or a related entity) is payable only  if the appreciation exceeds 100% of the fair market value of the shares  on the date of grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For the period from the first day of the first plan year  beginning on or after January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005, there is no  nonallocation year under this section if there would be no nonallocation  year under this section during that period if this section were applied  without regard to paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section (relating to  voting rights).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> This paragraph (iii) does not apply to an ESOP for which the  first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2005 begins after June  30, 2005.
