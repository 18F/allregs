                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will suspend your benefits if you are not disabled. We will  suspend your benefits if all of the information we have clearly shows  that you are not disabled and we will be unable to complete a  determination soon enough to prevent us from paying you more monthly  benefits than you are entitled to. This may occur when you are blind as  defined in the law and age 55 or older and you have returned to work  similar to work you previously performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)(i)</em> that your disability benefits should stop due to  your failure, without good cause (see Sec. 404.911), to comply with our  request for necessary information. When we have received the  information, we will reinstate your benefits for any previous month for  which they are otherwise payable, and continue with the CDR process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We will terminate your benefits. We will terminate your benefits  following 12 consecutive months of benefit suspension because you did  not comply with our request for information in accordance with  Sec. 404.1596(b)(2)(i). We will count the 12-month suspension period  from the start of the first month that you stopped receiving benefits  (see paragraph (b) of this section). This termination is effective with  the start of the 13th month after the suspension began because you  failed to cooperate.
