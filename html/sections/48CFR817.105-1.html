The justification must explain the cancellation ceiling and the method used to calculate that ceiling. The justification also must explain the advantages of multi-year contracts over other alternative methods, e.g., option year contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contracting officer must develop the cancellation ceilings in accordance with FAR 17.106-1.
