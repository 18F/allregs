If the Deputy Chief for Programs decides to decertify,  the decision will set forth the reasons for decertification, the period  of decertification, and the scope of decertification. If the Deputy  Chief for Programs decides not to decertify the technical service  provider, the technical service provider will be given written notice of  that determination. The decertification determination will be based on  an administrative record, which will be comprised of the Notice of  Proposed Decertification and supporting documents, and if submitted, the  technical service provider's written response and supporting  documentation. Both a copy of the decision and administrative record  will be sent promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested, to  the technical service provider.  [79 FR 44640, Aug. 1, 2014]</p>
