In cases involving mutilated or defaced Disbursement Postal Money Orders the owner should enclose the mutilated or defaced item with his communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Disbursement Postal Money Order, which is the basis of the owner's claim, is determined to be outstanding, the Money Order Division shall furnish the claimant an appropriate application form for obtaining a substitute Disbursement Postal Money Order. However, the execution of an application shall not be required in the event the original written statement submitted by the claimant substantially meets the requirements of the prescribed application form.</p>
