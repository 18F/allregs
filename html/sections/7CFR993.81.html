                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each handler shall pay to the committee, upon demand, with  respect to all salable prunes handled by him as the first handler  thereof, his pro rata share of all expenses which the Secretary finds  are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during each  crop year. Each handler's pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment  per ton fixed by the Secretary. At any time during or after a crop year  the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment to cover unanticipated  expenses of the committee or a deficit in assessable tonnage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the  committee, the committee may accept advance payments from any handler to  be credited toward such assessments as may be levied pursuant to this  section against the respective handler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any money collected as assessments during any crop year and not  expended in connection with the committee's operations may be used by  the committee for a period of five months subsequent to such crop year.  At the end of such period the committee shall, from funds on hand,  refund or credit to handler accounts the aforesaid excess. Each  handler's share of such excess funds shall be the amount of assessments  he has paid in excess of his pro rata share of the actual net expenses  of the committee for the preceding crop year. Any money collected from  assessments hereunder and remaining unexpended in the possession of the  committee at the termination of this part, shall be distributed in such  manner as the Secretary may direct: Provided, That to the extent  practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from  whom such funds were collected.
