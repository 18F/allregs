                                Sec. 902.22  Physical inspection of PHA projects.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The inspection, generally. The PHA's score for the physical condition indicator is based on an independent physical inspection of a PHA's project(s) provided by HUD and using HUD's Uniform Physical Condition Standard (UPCS) inspection protocols to ensure projects meet DSS/GR standards that constitute acceptable basic

housing conditions. Mixed-finance projects will be subject to the physical condition inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 902.13(a), PHAs with less than 250 public housing units will receive a PHAS assessment, based on their PHAS designation, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A small PHA that is a high performer will receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer will receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All other small PHAs will receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with Sec. 902.75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline score to be established for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Physical inspection under the PHAS physical condition indicator. (1) To achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will provide for an independent physical inspection of a PHA's project(s) that includes, at a minimum, a statistically valid sample of the units in the PHA's projects, to determine the extent of compliance with the DSS/GR standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will provide for an independent physical inspection of a PHA's project(s) that includes, at a minimum, a statistically valid sample of the units in the PHA's projects, to determine the extent of compliance with the DSS/GR standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only occupied units will be inspected as dwelling units (except units approved by HUD for nondwelling purposes, e.g., daycare or meeting rooms, which are inspected as common areas). Vacant units that are not under lease at the time of the physical inspection will not be inspected. The categories of vacant units not under lease that are exempted from physical inspection are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Units undergoing vacant unit turnaround--vacant units that are in the routine process of turnover; i.e., the period between which one resident has vacated a unit and a new lease takes effect;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Units undergoing rehabilitation--vacant units that have substantial rehabilitation needs already identified, and there is an approved implementation plan to address the identified rehabilitation needs and the plan is fully funded;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Offline units--vacant units that have repair requirements such that the units cannot be occupied in a normal period of time (considered to be between 5 and 7 days) and which are not included under an approved rehabilitation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Observed deficiencies. During the physical inspection of a project, an inspector looks for deficiencies for each inspectable item within the inspectable areas, such as holes (deficiencies) in the walls (item) of a dwelling unit (area). The dwelling units inspected in a project are a randomly selected, statistically valid sample of the units in the project, excluding vacant units not under lease at the time of the physical inspection, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exigent health and safety (EHS) deficiencies and health and safety (H&S;) deficiencies. (1) EHS deficiencies. To ensure prompt correction of EHS deficiencies, before leaving the site the inspector gives the project representative a Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that calls for immediate attention or remedy. The project representative acknowledges receipt of the deficiency report by signature. The project or PHA shall correct, remedy, or act to abate all EHS deficiencies cited in the deficiency report within 24 contiguous hours of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form. In addition, the project or PHA must certify to HUD within 3 business days of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that all EHS deficiencies were corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate within 24 continuous hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EHS deficiencies. To ensure prompt correction of EHS deficiencies, before leaving the site the inspector gives the project representative a Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that calls for immediate attention or remedy. The project representative acknowledges receipt of the deficiency report by signature. The project or PHA shall correct, remedy, or act to abate all EHS deficiencies cited in the deficiency report within 24 contiguous hours of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form. In addition, the project or PHA must certify to HUD within 3 business days of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that all EHS deficiencies were corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate within 24 continuous hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> H&S; deficiencies. The project or the PHA, or both, as appropriate, is required to expeditiously correct, remedy, or act to abate all H&S; deficiencies after receipt of the Physical Inspection Report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compliance with civil rights/nondiscrimination requirements. Elements

related to accessibility will be reviewed during the physical inspection to determine possible indications of noncompliance with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). A PHA will not be scored on those elements. Any indication of possible noncompliance will be referred to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.</p>
