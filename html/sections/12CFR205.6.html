                                Sec. 205.6  Liability of consumer for unauthorized transfers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions for liability. A consumer may be held liable, within  the limitations described in paragraph (b) of this section, for an  unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account  only if the financial institution has provided the disclosures required  by Sec. 205.7(b)(1), (2), and (3). If the unauthorized transfer  involved an access device, it must be an accepted access device and the  financial institution must have provided a means to identify the  consumer to whom it was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on amount of liability. A consumer's liability for  an unauthorized electronic fund transfer or a series of related  unauthorized transfers shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timely notice given. If the consumer notifies the financial  institution within two business days after learning of the loss or theft  of the access device,   the consumer's liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50 or the  amount of unauthorized transfers that occur before notice to the  financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timely notice not given. If the consumer fails to notify the  financial institution within two business days after learning of the  loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability shall not  exceed the lesser of $500 or the sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur within  the two business days, whichever is less; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of unauthorized transfers that occur after the close  of two business days and before notice to the institution, provided the  institution establishes that these transfers would not have occurred had  the consumer notified the institution within that two-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Periodic statement; timely notice not given. A consumer must  report an unauthorized electronic fund transfer that appears on a  periodic statement within 60 days of the financial institution's  transmittal of the statement to avoid liability for subsequent  transfers. If the consumer fails to do so, the consumer's liability  shall not exceed the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occur  after the close of the 60 days and before notice to the institution, and  that the institution establishes would not have occurred had the  consumer notified the institution within the 60-day period. When an  access device is involved in the unauthorized transfer, the consumer may  be liable for other amounts set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of  this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Extension of time limits. If the consumer's delay in notifying  the financial institution was due to extenuating circumstances, the  institution shall extend the times specified above to a reasonable  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notice to financial institution. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice to a financial  institution is given when a consumer takes steps reasonably necessary to  provide the institution with the pertinent information, whether or not a  particular employee or agent of the institution actually receives the  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consumer may notify the institution in person, by  telephone, or in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Written notice is considered given at the time the consumer  mails the notice or delivers it for transmission to the institution by  any other usual means. Notice may be considered constructively given  when the institution becomes aware of circumstances leading to the  reasonable belief that an unauthorized transfer to or from the  consumer's account has been or may be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Liability under state law or agreement. If state law or an  agreement between the consumer and the financial institution imposes  less liability than is provided by this section, the consumer's  liability shall not exceed the amount imposed under the state law or  agreement.</p>
