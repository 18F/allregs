                                Sec. 780.131  Operations which constitute one a ``farmer.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Generally, an employer must undertake farming operations of such  scope   and significance as to constitute a distinct activity, for the purpose  of yielding a farm product, in order to be regarded as a ``farmer.'' It  does not necessarily follow, however, that any employer is a ``farmer''  simply because he engages in some actual farming operations of the type  specified in section 3(f). Thus, one who merely harvests a crop of  agricultural commodities is not a ``farmer'' although his employees who  actually do the harvesting are employed in ``agriculture'' in those  weeks when exclusively so engaged. As a general rule, a farmer performs  his farming operations on land owned, leased, or controlled by him and  devoted to his own use. The mere fact, therefore, that an employer  harvests a growing crop, even under a partnership agreement pursuant to  which he provides credit, advisory or other services, is not generally  considered to be sufficient to qualify the employer so engaged as a  ``farmer.'' Such an employer would stand, in packing or handling the  product, in the same relationship to the produce as if it were from the  fields or groves of an independent grower. One who engaged merely in  practices which are incidental to farming is not a ``farmer.'' For  example, a company which merely prepares for market, sells, and ships  flowers and plants grown and cultivated on farms by affiliated  corporations is not a ``farmer.'' The fact that one has suspended actual  farming operations during a period in which he performs only practices  incidental to his part or prospective farming operations does not,  however, preclude him from qualifying as a ``farmer.'' One otherwise  qualified as a farmer does not lose his status as such because he  performs farming operations on land which he does not own or control, as  in the case of a cattleman using public lands for grazing.</p>
