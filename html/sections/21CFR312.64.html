                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Progress reports. The investigator shall furnish all reports to  the sponsor of the drug who is responsible for collecting and evaluating  the results obtained. The sponsor is required under Sec. 312.33 to  submit annual reports to FDA on the progress of the clinical  investigations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Safety reports. An investigator must immediately report to the  sponsor any serious adverse event, whether   or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol  or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there  is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. Study  endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality)  must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is  evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event  (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must  immediately report the event to the sponsor. The investigator must  record nonserious adverse events and report them to the sponsor  according to the timetable for reporting specified in the protocol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final report. An investigator shall provide the sponsor with an  adequate report shortly after completion of the investigator's  participation in the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financial disclosure reports. The clinical investigator shall  provide the sponsor with sufficient accurate financial information to  allow an applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or  disclosure statements as required under part 54 of this chapter. The  clinical investigator shall promptly update this information if any  relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for 1  year following the completion of the study.
