                            <p class="depth0">All passenger equipment shall comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Conductors. Conductor sizes shall be selected on the basis of current-carrying capacity, mechanical strength, temperature, flexibility requirements, and maximum allowable voltage drop.

Current-carrying capacity shall be derated for grouping and for operating temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Main battery system. (1) The main battery compartment shall be isolated from the cab and passenger seating areas by a non-combustible barrier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Battery chargers shall be designed to protect against overcharging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If batteries are of the type to potentially vent explosive gases, the battery compartment shall be adequately ventilated to prevent the accumulation of explosive concentrations of these gases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Power dissipation resistors. (1) Power dissipating resistors shall be adequately ventilated to prevent overheating under worst-case operating conditions as determined by the railroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Power dissipation grids shall be designed and installed with sufficient isolation to prevent combustion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Resistor elements shall be electrically insulated from resistor frames, and the frames shall be electrically insulated from the supports that hold them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Electromagnetic interference and compatibility. (1) The operating railroad shall ensure electromagnetic compatibility of the safety-critical equipment systems with their environment. Electromagnetic compatibility may be achieved through equipment design or changes to the operating environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The electronic equipment shall not produce electrical noise that affects the safe performance of train line control and communications or wayside signaling systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To contain electromagnetic interference emissions, suppression of transients shall be at the source wherever possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All electronic equipment shall be self-protected from damage or improper operation, or both, due to high voltage transients and long-term over-voltage or under-voltage conditions. This includes protection from both power frequency and harmonic effects as well as protection from radio frequency signals into the microwave frequency range.</p>
