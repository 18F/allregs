                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Secs. 62.14452(o) through (q), you must  install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and  operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the applicable  maximum and minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of this  subpart (unless CEMS are used as a substitute for certain parameters as  specified) such that these devices (or methods) measure and record  values for the operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in  Table 3 of this subpart at all times. For charge rate, the device must  measure and record the date, time and weight of each charge fed to the  HMIWI. This must be done automatically, meaning that the only  intervention from an operator during the process would be to load the  charge onto the weighing device. For batch HMIWI, the maximum charge  rate is measured on a daily basis (the amount of waste charged to the  unit each day).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For all HMIWI, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers'  specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring  the use of the bypass stack, including the date, time and duration of  such use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For all HMIWI, if you are using controls other than a dry  scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a  FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions  limits under Sec. 62.14411, you must install, calibrate (to  manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate the equipment  necessary to monitor the site-specific operating parameters developed  pursuant to Sec. 62.14453(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI  operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction,  calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data must be  obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of  the operating days per calendar quarter that your HMIWI is combusting  hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (12) of this  section for each bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed,  calibrated, operated and maintained according to the ``Fabric Filter Bag  Leak Detection Guidance,'' (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). This  document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector  Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02),  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the  Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center  Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection  systems must be installed, operated, calibrated and maintained in a  manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and  recommendations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the  manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations  of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic  foot) or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of  relative PM loadings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to  continuously record the output signal from the sensor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible  alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative  PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located  where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For positive pressure FF systems, a bag leak detector must be  installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For negative pressure or induced air FF, the bag leak detector  must be installed downstream of the FF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's  instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range  and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set  points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the ``Fabric  Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or  range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time may not be  adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100  percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless  such adjustment follows a complete FF inspection that demonstrates that  the FF is in good operating condition. Each adjustment must be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Record the results of each inspection, calibration and  validation check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak  detection system alarm; operate and maintain the FF such that the alarm  is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a  6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the FF demonstrates  that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If  corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1  hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the  alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate  corrective action.
