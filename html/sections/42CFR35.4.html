No patient shall be discharged or transferred on account of  noncompliance if to do so would seriously endanger his life or health,  nor shall any patient be discharged if his failure to comply is due, in  the opinion of the officer in charge, to a mental disease or disorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the discharge or transfer of a patient is likely to endanger  the health of persons other than the patient or officers or employees of  the station or hospital, the officer in charge shall give advance notice  to appropriate State, county, or municipal authorities of the discharge  or transfer.</p>
