                            <p class="depth0">Interference resulting from the use of cable system terminal  equipment (including subscriber terminal, input selector switch and any  other accessories) shall be the responsibility of the cable system  terminal equipment operator in accordance with the provisions of part 15  of this chapter: provided, however, that the operator of a cable system  to which the cable system terminal equipment is connected shall be  responsible for detecting and eliminating any signal leakage where that  leakage would cause interference outside the subscriber's premises and/ or would cause the cable system to exceed the Part 76 signal leakage  requirements. In cases where excessive signal leakage occurs, the cable  operator shall be required only to discontinue service to the subscriber  until the problem is corrected.
