Each Large Packaging used to transport liquid regulated medical waste must contain absorbent material in sufficient quantity and appropriate location to absorb the entire amount of liquid present in the event of an unintentional release of contents. Each Large Packaging design intended for the transportation of sharps containers must be puncture resistant and capable of retaining liquids. The design must also be tested and certified as meeting the performance tests specified for intermediate bulk containers intended for the transportation of liquids in subpart O of part 178 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-specification bulk packaging. A wheeled cart (Cart) or bulk outer packaging (BOP) is authorized as an outer packaging for the transportation of regulated medical waste in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. The following requirements apply to the transportation of regulated medical waste in Carts or BOPs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Regulated medical waste in each Cart or BOP must be contained in non-bulk inner packagings conforming to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each Cart or BOP must have smooth, non-porous interior surfaces free of cracks, crevices, and other defects that could damage plastic film inner packagings or impede disinfection operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), each Cart or BOP must be used exclusively for the transportation of regulated medical waste. Prior to reuse, each Cart or BOP must be disinfected by any means effective for neutralizing the infectious substance the packaging previously contained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Untreated concentrated stock cultures of infectious substances containing Category A materials may not be transported in a Cart or BOP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Division 6.1 toxic waste or Class 7 radioactive waste, with the exception of chemotherapeutic waste, may not be transported in a Cart or BOP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Division 6.1 or Class 7 chemotherapeutic waste; untreated concentrated stock cultures of infectious substances containing Category B infectious substances; unabsorbed liquids; and sharps containers may be transported in a Cart or BOP only if packaged in rigid non-bulk packagings conforming to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wheeled cart (Cart). A Cart is authorized as an outer packaging for the transportation of regulated medical waste if it conforms to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each Cart must consist of a solid, one-piece body with a nominal volume not exceeding 1,655 L (437 gallons).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each Cart must be constructed of metal, rigid plastic, or fiberglass fitted with a lid to prevent leakage during transport.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each Cart must be capable of meeting the requirements of Sec. 178.810
