In connection with any particular matter, reference also should be made to any special requirements of procedure and practice that may be contained in the particular statute involved or the rules and forms adopted by the FDIC thereunder, which special requirements are controlling. In addition to any suspension hereunder, a person may be excluded from further participation under parts 390 and 391 from an adjudicatory proceeding in accordance with Sec. 390.35(a)(1), from a removal hearing in accordance with Sec. 390.12, or from an investigatory proceeding in accordance with Sec. 390.84(b)(2). Furthermore, no person who has been suspended or debarred from practice before the FDIC in accordance with the provisions of this subpart may submit to the FDIC, either directly or on behalf of an interested party, any written documents or petitions otherwise permitted under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
