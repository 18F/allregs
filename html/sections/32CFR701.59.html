                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1): Those properly and currently classified in  the interest of national defense or foreign policy, as specifically  authorized under the criteria established by Executive Order and  implemented by regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Although material is not classified at the time of the FOIA  request, a classification review may be undertaken to determine whether  the information should be classified based on the Executive Order on  classification (i.e., Executive Order 12958) and/or a security  classification guide. The procedures for reclassification are addressed  in the Executive Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the information qualifies as exemption (b)(1) information,  there is no discretion regarding its release. In addition, this  exemption shall be invoked when the following situations are apparent:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Glomar response: The fact of the existence or nonexistence of a  record would itself reveal classified information. In this situation,  DON activities shall neither confirm nor deny the existence or  nonexistence of the record being requested. A ``refusal to confirm or  deny'' response must be used consistently, not only when a record  exists, but also when a record does not exist. Otherwise, the pattern of  using a ``no record'' response when a record does not exist, and a  ``refusal to confirm or deny'' when a record does exist will itself  disclose national security information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Compilation: Compilations of items of information that are  individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information  reveals additional association or relationship that meets the standard  for classification under an existing executive order for classification  and is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> High (b)(2) are records containing or constituting statutes,  rules, regulations, orders, manuals, directives, instructions, and  security classification guides, the release of which would allow  circumvention of these records thereby substantially hindering the  effective performance of a significant function of the DON. For example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Those operating rules, guidelines, and manuals for DON  investigators, inspectors, auditors, or examiners that must remain  privileged in order for the DON activity fulfill a legal requirement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Personnel and other administrative matters, such as examination  questions and answers used in training courses or in the determination  of the qualifications of candidates for employment, entrance on duty,  advancement, or promotion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Computer software, the release of which would allow  circumvention of a statute or DON rules, regulations, orders, manuals,  directives, or instructions. In this situation, the use of the software  must be closely examined to ensure a circumvention possibility exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> records are  those matters which are trivial and housekeeping in nature for which  there is no legitimate public interest or benefit to be gained by  release, and it would constitute an administrative burden to process the  request in order to disclose the records. Examples include rules of  personnel's use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,  statements of policy as   to sick leave, and administrative data such as file numbers, mail  routing stamps, initials, data processing notations, brief references to  previous communications, and other like administrative markings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(3): Those concerning matters that a statute  specifically exempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion  on the issue, or in accordance with criteria established by that statute  for withholding or referring to particular types of matters to be  withheld. A few examples of (b)(3) statutes are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 10 U.S.C. 128, Physical Protection of Special Nuclear Material,  Limitation on Dissemination of Unclassified Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 10 U.S.C. 130, Authority to Withhold From Public Disclosure  Certain Technical Data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 10 U.S.C. 1102, Confidentiality of Medical Quality Assurance  Records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 10 U.S.C. 2305(g), Protection of Contractor Submitted Proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 12 U.S.C. 3403, Confidentiality of Financial Records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 18 U.S.C. 798, Communication Intelligence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 35 U.S.C. 181-188, Patent Secrecy--any records containing  information relating to inventions that are the subject of patent  applications on which Patent Secrecy Orders have been issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> 35 U.S.C. 205, Confidentiality of Inventions Information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> 41 U.S.C. 423, Procurement Integrity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> 42 U.S.C. 2162, Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> 50 U.S.C. 403 (d)(3), Protection of Intelligence Sources and  Methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(4): Those containing trade secrets or  commercial or financial information that a DON activity receives from a  person or organization outside the Government with the understanding  that the information or record will be retained on a privileged or  confidential basis in accordance with the customary handling of such  records. Records within the exemption must contain trade secrets, or  commercial or financial records, the disclosure of which is likely to  cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the source  providing the information; impair the Government's ability to obtain  necessary information in the future; or impair some other legitimate  Government interest. Commercial or financial information submitted on a  voluntary basis, absent any exercised authority prescribing criteria for  submission is protected without any requirement to show competitive  harm. If the information qualifies as exemption (b)(4) information,  there is no discretion in its release. Examples include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial or financial information received in confidence in  connection with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals set forth in or  incorporated by reference in a contract entered into between the DON  activity and the offeror that submitted the proposal, as well as other  information received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets,  inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. Additionally, when  the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) and 41 U.S.C. 423 are met, certain  proprietary and source selection information may be withheld under  exemption (b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statistical data and commercial or financial information  concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and  expenditures, if offered and received in confidence from a contractor or  potential contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal statements given in the course of inspections,  investigations, or audits, when such statements are received in  confidence from the individual and retained in confidence because they  reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information normally  considered confidential or privileged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial data provided in confidence by private employers in  connection with locality wage surveys that are used to fix and adjust  pay schedules applicable to the prevailing wage rate of employees within  the DON.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments  concerning technical or scientific data or other information submitted  with an application for a research grant, or with a report while  research is in progress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Technical or scientific data developed by a contractor or  subcontractor   exclusively at private expense, and technical or scientific data  developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense,  wherein the contractor or subcontractor has retained legitimate  proprietary interests in such data in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2320- 2321 and DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), chapter  2 of 48 CFR, subparts 227.71 and 227.72. Technical data developed  exclusively with Federal funds may be withheld under Exemption (b)(3) if  it meets the criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130 and DoD Directive 5230.25 of 6  November 1984.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Computer software which is copyrighted under the Copyright Act  of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would have an adverse  impact on the potential market value of a copyrighted work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Proprietary information submitted strictly on a voluntary basis,  absent any exercised authority prescribing criteria for submission.  Examples of exercised authorities prescribing criteria for submission  are statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, invitations for bids,  requests for proposals, and contracts. Submission of information under  these authorities is not voluntary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5): Those containing information considered  privileged in litigation, primarily under the deliberative process  privilege. For example: internal advice, recommendations, and subjective  evaluations, as contrasted with factual matters, that are reflected in  deliberative records pertaining to the decision-making process of an  agency, whether within or among agencies or within or among DON  activities. In order to meet the test of this exemption, the record must  be both deliberative in nature, as well as part of a decision-making  process. Merely being an internal record is insufficient basis for  withholding under this exemption. Also potentially exempted are records  pertaining to the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work- product privilege. This exemption is entirely discretionary. Examples of  the deliberative process include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nonfactual portions of staff papers, to include after-action  reports, lessons learned, and situation reports containing staff  evaluations, advice, opinions, or suggestions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advice, suggestions, or evaluations prepared on behalf of the  DON by individual consultants or by boards, committees, councils,  groups, panels, conferences, commissions, task forces, or other similar  groups that are formed for the purpose of obtaining advice and  recommendations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those non-factual portions of evaluations by DON personnel of  contractors and their products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature or  such matters as proposed plans to procure, lease or otherwise acquire  and dispose of materials, real estate, facilities or functions, when  such information would provide undue or unfair competitive advantage to  private personal interests or would impede legitimate government  functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Trade secret or other confidential research development, or  commercial information owned by the Government, where premature release  is likely to affect the Government's negotiating position or other  commercial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Those portions of official reports of inspection, reports of the  Inspector Generals, audits, investigations, or surveys pertaining to  safety, security, or the internal management, administration, or  operation of one or more DON activities, when these records have  traditionally been treated by the courts as privileged against  disclosure in litigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Planning, programming, and budgetary information that is  involved in the defense planning and resource allocation process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If any such intra- or inter-agency record or reasonably  segregable portion of such record hypothetically would be made available  routinely through the discovery process in the course of litigation with  the agency, then it should not be withheld under the FOIA. If, however,  the information hypothetically would not be released at all, or would  only be released in a particular case during civil discovery where a  party's particularized showing of need might override a privilege, then  the record may be withheld. Discovery is the formal process by which  litigants obtain information from each other for   use in the litigation. Consult with legal counsel to determine whether  exemption 5 material would be routinely made available through the  discovery process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Intra- or inter-agency memoranda or letters that are factual, or  those reasonably segregable portions that are factual, are routinely  made available through discovery, and shall be made available to a  requester, unless the factual material is otherwise exempt from release,  inextricably intertwined with the exempt information, so fragmented as  to be uninformative, or so redundant of information already available to  the requester as to provide no new substantive information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though  contained in an internal communication, generally cannot be withheld  from a requester if it constitutes policy guidance or a decision, as  distinguished from a discussion of preliminary matters or a request for  information or advice that would compromise the decision-making process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> An internal communication concerning a decision that  subsequently has been made a matter of public record must be made  available to a requester when the rationale for the decision is  expressly adopted or incorporated by reference in the record containing  the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6): Information in personnel and medical files,  as well as similar personal information in other files, that, if  disclosed to a requester, other than the person about whom the  information is about, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of  personal privacy. Release of information about an individual contained  in a Privacy Act System of records that would constitute a clearly  unwarranted invasion of privacy is prohibited, and could subject the  releaser to civil and criminal penalties. If the information qualifies  as exemption (b)(6) information, there is no discretion in its release.  Examples of other files containing personal information similar to that  contained in personnel and medical files include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the suitability of  candidates for civilian employment or membership in the Armed Forces,  and the eligibility of individuals (civilian, military, or contractor  employees) for security clearances, or for access to particularly  sensitive classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Files containing reports, records, and other material pertaining  to personnel matters in which administrative action, including  disciplinary action, may be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Home addresses, including private e-mail addresses, are normally  not releasable without the consent of the individuals concerned. This  includes lists of home addressees and military quarters' addressees  without the occupant's name. Additionally, the names and duty addresses  (postal and/or e-mail) of DON/DoD military and civilian personnel who  are assigned to units that are sensitive, routinely deployable, or  stationed in foreign territories can constitute a clearly unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Privacy interest. A privacy interest may exist in personal  information even though the information has been disclosed at some place  and time. If personal information is not freely available from sources  other than the Federal Government, a privacy interest exists in its  nondisclosure. The fact that the Federal Government expended funds to  prepare, index and maintain records on personal information, and the  fact that a requester invokes FOIA to obtain these records indicates the  information is not freely available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Names and duty addresses (postal and/or e-mail) published in  telephone directories, organizational charts, rosters and similar  materials for personnel assigned to units that are sensitive, routinely  deployable, or stationed in foreign territories are withholdable under  this exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> This exemption shall not be used in an attempt to protect the  privacy of a deceased person, but it may be used to protect the privacy  of the deceased person's family if disclosure would rekindle grief,  anguish, pain, embarrassment, or even disruption of peace of mind of  surviving family members. In such situations, balance the surviving  family members' privacy against the public's right to know to determine  if   disclosure is in the public interest. Additionally, the deceased's  social security number should be withheld since it is used by the next  of kin to receive benefits. Disclosures may be made to the immediate  next of kin as defined in DoD Directive 5154.24 of 28 October 1996  (NOTAL).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of third parties  identified in a personnel, medical or similar record constitutes a basis  for deleting those reasonably segregable portions of that record. When  withholding third party personal information from the subject of the  record and the record is contained in a Privacy Act system of records,  consult with legal counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> This exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or  nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personally  private information, and the public interest in disclosure is not  sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest. In this situation, DON  activities shall neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence  of the record being requested. This is a Glomar response, and exemption  (b)(6) must be cited in the response. Additionally, in order to insure  personal privacy is not violated during referrals, DON activities shall  coordinate with other DON activities or Federal agencies before  referring a record that is exempt under the Glomar concept.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A ``refusal to confirm or deny'' response must be used  consistently, not only when a record exists, but also when a record does  not exist. Otherwise, the pattern of using a ``no records'' response  when a record does not exist and a ``refusal to confirm or deny'' when a  record does exist will itself disclose personally private information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Refusal to confirm or deny should not be used when the person  whose personal privacy is in jeopardy has provided the requester a  waiver of his or her privacy rights; the person initiated or directly  participated in an investigation that led to the creation of an agency  record seeks access to that record; or the person whose personal privacy  is in jeopardy is deceased, the Agency is aware of that fact, and  disclosure would not invade the privacy of the deceased's family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7). Records or information compiled for law  enforcement purposes; i.e., civil, criminal, or military law, including  the implementation of Executive Orders or regulations issued under law.  This exemption may be invoked to prevent disclosure of documents not  originally created for, but later gathered for law enforcement purposes.  With the exception of (b)(7)(C) and (b)(7)(F), this exemption is  discretionary. This exemption applies, however, only to the extent that  production of such law enforcement records or information could result  in the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A): Could reasonably be expected to interfere  with enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(B): Would deprive a person of the right to a  fair trial or to an impartial adjudication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C): Could reasonably be expected to  constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of a living  person, including surviving family members of an individual identified  in such a record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or  nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personally  private information, and the public interest in disclosure is not  sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest. In this situation,  Components shall neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence  of the record being requested. This is a Glomar response, and exemption  (b)(7)(C) must be cited in the response. Additionally, in order to  insure personal privacy is not violated during referrals, DON activities  shall coordinate with other DON/DoD activities or Federal Agencies  before referring a record that is exempt under the Glomar concept. A  ``refusal to confirm or deny'' response must be used consistently, not  only when a record exists, but also when a record does not exist.  Otherwise, the pattern of using a ``no records'' response when a record  does not exist and a ``refusal to confirm or deny'' when a record does  exist will itself disclose personally private information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Refusal to confirm or deny should not be used when the person  whose personal privacy is in jeopardy has provided the requester with a  waiver of his   or her privacy rights; or the person whose personal privacy is in  jeopardy is deceased, and the activity is aware of that fact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(D): Could reasonably be expected to disclose  the identity of a confidential source, including a source within the  DON; a State, local, or foreign agency or authority; or any private  institution that furnishes the information on a confidential basis; and  could disclose information furnished from a confidential source and  obtained by a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal  investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security  intelligence investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(E): Would disclose techniques and procedures  for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose  guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such  disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the  law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(F): Could reasonably be expected to endanger  the life or physical safety of any individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Some examples of exemption 7 are: Statements of witnesses and  other material developed during the course of the investigation and all  materials prepared in connection with related Government litigation or  adjudicative proceedings; the identity of firms or individuals being  investigated for alleged irregularities involving contracting with the  DoD when no indictment has been obtained nor any civil action filed  against them by the United States; information obtained in confidence,  expressed or implied, in the course of a criminal investigation by a  criminal law enforcement agency or office within a DON activity or a  lawful national security intelligence investigation conducted by an  authorized agency or office within the DON; national security  intelligence investigations include background security investigations  and those investigations conducted for the purpose of obtaining  affirmative or counterintelligence information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The right of individual litigants to investigative records  currently available by law (such as, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500), is  not diminished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Exclusions. Excluded from the exemption in paragraph (g)(8) are  the following two situations applicable to the DON:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a request is made that involves access to records or  information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and the investigation  or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law where there  is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding  is unaware of its pendency, and the disclosure of the existence of the  records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement  proceedings, DON activities may, during only such times as that  circumstance continues, treat the records or information as not subject  to the FOIA. In such situation, the response to the requester will state  that no records were found.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law  enforcement organization within a DON activities under the informant's  name or personal identifier are requested by a third party using the  informant's name or personal identifier, the DON activity may treat the  records as not subject to the FOIA, unless the informant's status as an  informant has been officially confirmed. If it is determined that the  records are not subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7), the response to the  requester will state that no records were found.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> DON activities considering invoking an exclusion should first  consult with the DOJ's Office of Information and Privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8): Those contained in or related to  examination, operation or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of,  or for the use of any agency responsible for the regulation or  supervision of financial institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9): Those containing geological and geophysical  information and data (including maps) concerning wells.
