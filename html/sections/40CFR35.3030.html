                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any construction grant application or grantee who has been adversely affected by a State's action or omission may request Regional review of such action or omission, but must first submit a petition for review to the State agency that made the initial decision.

The State agency will make a final decision in accordance with procedures set forth in the delegation agreement. The State must provide, in writing, normally within 45 days of the date it receives the petition, the basis for its decision regarding the disputed action or omission. The final State decision must be labeled as such and, if adverse to the applicant or grantee, must include notice of the right to request Regional review of the State decision under this section. A State's failure to address the disputed action or omission in a timely fashion, or in writing, will not preclude Regional review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for Regional review must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of any written State decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the amount in dispute,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the issues involved, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A concise statement of the objections to the State decision.
The request must be filed by registered mail, return receipt requested, within thirty days of the date of the State decision or within a reasonable time if the State fails to respond in writing to the request for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Region shall determine whether the State's review is comparable to a dispute decision official's (DDO) review pursuant to 2 CFR part 1500, subpart E. If the State's review is comparable, Regional review of the State's decision will be conducted by the Regional Administrator. If the State's review is not comparable, the DDO will review the State's decision and issue a written decision. Review of either a Regional Administrator or DDO decision may be requested pursuant to 2 CFR part 1500, subpart E.
