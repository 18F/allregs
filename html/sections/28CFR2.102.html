                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the parolee requests a local revocation hearing, he shall be  given a revocation hearing reasonably near the place of the alleged  violation(s) or arrest, with the opportunity to contest the charges  against him, if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parolee has not been convicted of a crime committed while  under supervision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parolee denies all charges against him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The parolee shall also be given a local revocation hearing if he  admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged violations, but  denies at least one unadjudicated charge that may be determinative of  the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or reparole, and  requests the presence of one or more adverse witnesses regarding that  contested charge. If the appearance of such witness at the hearing is  precluded by the Commission for good cause, a local revocation hearing  shall not be ordered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there are two or more contested charges, a local revocation  hearing may be conducted near the place of the violation chiefly relied  upon by the Commission as a basis for the issuance of the warrant or  summons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A parolee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing  upon the parolee's return or recommitment to an institution if the  parolee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Voluntarily waives the right to a local revocation hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged  violations without contesting any unadjudicated charge that may be  determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or  reparole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An institutional revocation hearing may also be conducted in the  District of Columbia jail or prison facility in which the parolee is  being held. On his own motion, a Commissioner may designate any case  described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a local revocation  hearing. The difference in procedures between a ``local revocation  hearing'' and an ``institutional revocation hearing'' is set forth in  Sec.  2.103(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em>. A parolee who has been given a revocation hearing pursuant  to the issuance of a summons shall remain on supervision pending the  decision of the Commission, unless the Commission has provided  otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A local revocation hearing shall be held not later than sixty- five days from the retaking of the parolee on the parole violation  warrant. An institutional revocation hearing shall be held within ninety  days of the retaking of the parolee on the parole violation warrant. If  the parolee requests and receives any postponement, or consents to any  postponement, or by his actions otherwise precludes the prompt  completion of revocation proceedings in his   case, the above-stated time limits shall be correspondingly extended.
