amount of cropland, pastureland, and land that is equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land, needed for the annual EPA evaluation specified in Sec. 80.1454(g)(1), and whether the data, analyses, and methodologies are publicly available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any petition and all supporting materials submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted both in English and its original language (if other than English), and must include all of the following or an explanation of why it is not needed for EPA to consider the petition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maps or electronic data identifying the boundaries of the land for which the petitioner seeks approval of an aggregate compliance approach.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total amount of land that is cropland, pastureland, or land equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land within the geographic boundaries specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that was cleared or cultivated prior to December 19, 2007 and that was actively managed or fallow and nonforested on that date, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Land use data that demonstrates that the land identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is cropland, pastureland or land equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land that was cleared or cultivated prior to December 19, 2007, and that was actively managed or fallow and nonforested on that date, which may include any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Satellite imagery or data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aerial photography.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Census data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Agricultural survey data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Agricultural economic modeling data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Historical land use data for the land within the geographic boundaries specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the current year, which may include any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Satellite imagery or data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aerial photography.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Census data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Agricultural surveys.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Agricultural economic modeling data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of any applicable laws, agricultural practices, economic considerations, or other relevant factors that had or may have an effect on the use of agricultural land within the geographic boundaries specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including information regarding the efficacy and enforcement of relevant laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A plan describing how the petitioner will identify a credible and reliable entity who will, on a continuing basis, conduct data gathering, analysis, and submittal to assist EPA in making an annual determination of whether the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section remains satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A letter, signed by a national government representative at the ministerial level or equivalent, confirming that the petition and all supporting data have been reviewed and verified by the ministry (or ministries) or department(s) of the national government with primary expertise in agricultural land use patterns, practices, data, and statistics, that the data support a finding that planted crops and crop residue from the specified country meet the definition of renewable biomass and will continue to meet the definition of renewable biomass, and that the responsible national government ministry (or ministries) or department(s) will review and verify the data submitted on an annual basis to facilitate EPA's annual evaluation of the 2007 baseline area of land specified in Sec. 80.1454(g)(1) for the country in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any additional information the Administrator may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA will issue a Federal Register notice informing the public of receipt of any petition submitted pursuant to this section and will provide a 60-day period for public comment.
