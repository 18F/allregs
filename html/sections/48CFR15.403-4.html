                                15.403-4  Requiring certified cost or pricing data
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer shall obtain certified cost or  pricing data only if the contracting officer concludes that none of the  exceptions in 15.403-1(b) applies. However, if the contracting officer  has reason to believe exceptional circumstances exist and has sufficient  data available to determine a fair and reasonable price, then the  contracting officer should consider requesting a waiver under the  exception at 15.403-1(b)(4). The threshold for obtaining certified cost  or pricing data is $750,000. Unless an exception applies, certified cost  or pricing data are required before accomplishing any of the following  actions expected to exceed the current threshold or, in the case of  existing contracts, the threshold specified in the contract:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The award of any negotiated contract (except for undefinitized  actions such as letter contracts).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The award of a subcontract at any tier, if the contractor and  each higher-tier subcontractor were required to furnish certified cost  or pricing data (but see waivers at 15.403-1(c)(4)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The modification of any sealed bid or negotiated contract  (whether or not certified cost or pricing data were initially required)  or any subcontract covered by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this subsection.  Price adjustment amounts must consider both increases and decreases  (e.g., a $200,000 modification resulting from a reduction of $500,000  and an increase of $300,000 is a pricing adjustment exceeding $750,000).  This requirement does not apply when unrelated and separately priced  changes for which certified cost or pricing data would not otherwise be  required are included for administrative convenience in the same  modification. Negotiated final pricing actions (such as termination  settlements and total final price agreements for fixed-price incentive   and redeterminable contracts) are contract modifications requiring  certified cost or pricing data if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The total final price agreement for such settlements or  agreements exceeds the pertinent threshold set forth at paragraph (a)(1)  of this subsection; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The partial termination settlement plus the estimate to complete  the continued portion of the contract exceeds the pertinent threshold  set forth at paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection (see 49.105(c)(15)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless prohibited because an exception at 15.403-1(b) applies,  the head of the contracting activity, without power of delegation, may  authorize the contracting officer to obtain certified cost or pricing  data for pricing actions below the pertinent threshold in paragraph  (a)(1) of this subsection, provided the action exceeds the simplified  acquisition threshold. The head of the contracting activity shall  justify the requirement for certified cost or pricing data. The  documentation shall include a written finding that certified cost or  pricing data are necessary to determine whether the price is fair and  reasonable and the facts supporting that finding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When certified cost or pricing data are required, the  contracting officer shall require the contractor or prospective  contractor to submit to the contracting officer (and to have any  subcontractor or prospective subcontractor submit to the prime  contractor or appropriate subcontractor tier) the following in support  of any proposal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified  cost or pricing data required by the contracting officer to determine  that the price is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, in the format  specified in 15.406-2, certifying that to the best of its knowledge and  belief, the cost or pricing data were accurate, complete, and current as  of the date of agreement on price or, if applicable, an earlier date  agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to the  date of agreement on price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If certified cost or pricing data are requested and submitted by  an offeror, but an exception is later found to apply, the data must not  be considered certified cost or pricing data as defined in 2.101 and  must not be certified in accordance with 15.406-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of this subsection also apply to contracts  entered into by an agency on behalf of a foreign government.
