(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, CMS pays an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable cost it incurs, as specified in subpart O of this part, for the covered Part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment for Part B services: Basic rules--(i) Cost basis payment.

This requirement does not affect Medicare payment to the HCPP for physicians' services furnished to its Medicare enrollees for which the physicians are compensated by the HCPP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Payment for services to nonenrollees. CMS makes payment to an HCPP for covered Part B services furnished by the HCPP to a Medicare beneficiary who is not enrolled in the HCPP if the beneficiary assigns his rights to payment in accordance with Sec. 424.55 of this chapter. Payment is made on a reasonable charge basis through the HCPP's Medicare carrier.
