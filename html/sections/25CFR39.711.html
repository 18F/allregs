If a school transports students over unimproved roads, the  school must separate the number of miles driven for each bus into  improved miles and unimproved miles. The number of miles driven is the  sum of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of miles driven on improved roads; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of miles driven on unimproved roads multiplied by  1.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The annual miles driven for each school is the sum of the  mileage from paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section multiplied by  4.</p><p class="depth2">Reporting Requirements</p>
