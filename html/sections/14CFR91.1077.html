                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To obtain initial and final approval of a training program, or a revision to an approved training program, each program manager must submit to the Administrator--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An outline of the proposed or revised curriculum, that provides enough information for a preliminary evaluation of the proposed training program or revision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional relevant information that may be requested by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the proposed training program or revision complies with this subpart, the Administrator grants initial approval in writing after which the program manager may conduct the training under that program. The Administrator then evaluates the effectiveness of the training program and advises the program manager of deficiencies, if any, that must be corrected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator grants final approval of the proposed training program or revision if the program manager shows that the training conducted under the initial approval in paragraph (b) of this section ensures that each person who successfully completes the training is adequately trained to perform that person's assigned duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of a training program that has been granted final approval, the program manager must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the program that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the program manager receives the notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the Administrator. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice pending a decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that there is an emergency that requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.</p>
