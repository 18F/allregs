                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of these regulations is to implement the 1989  Amendments to the FLSA with respect to minimum wage increases in Puerto  Rico. These regulations establish the applicable wage rates and  effective dates in the four statutory tiers and categorize industries  and governmental entities in Puerto Rico in those tiers according to  average hourly wage rates. In addition, these regulations explain the  methodology used to determine appropriate tiers, including the use of  standard industrial classification (SIC) codes to categorize industries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subpart A of this part summarizes the provisions of the  Amendments as applicable to Puerto Rico and defines the terms used  herein. Subpart B of this part states the specific minimum wage rates  for each tier and the effective dates of those rates. Subpart C of this  part explains how industry and governmental categories were determined,  the general methodology used to conduct the surveys which provided the  data used to determine average hourly wage rates, and special issues in  the classification of governmental entities. Appendix A of this part  contains a listing of manufacturing industries by Standard Industrial  Classification (SIC) code and indicates the tier to which each industry  is subject. Appendix B of this part contains a listing of  nonmanufacturing industries by SIC code and indicates the tier to which  each industry is subject. Appendix C of this part contains a listing of  government corporations and indicates the tier to which each such  corporation is subject. Appendix D of this part contains a listing of  municipalities and indicates the tier to which each municipality is  subject.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing contained in this part should be construed as precluding  the Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board, which has been granted authority to  promulgate minimum wage rates above the Federal statutory minimum, from  providing for increases in any industry which would exceed the rates  provided for in these regulations or in section 6(a)(1) of the Act.</p>
