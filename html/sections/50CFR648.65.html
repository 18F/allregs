                                Sec. 648.65  Windowpane flounder sub-ACL and AM for the scallop fishery.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As specified in Sec. 648.55(d), and pursuant to the biennial framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.90, the scallop fishery shall be allocated a sub-ACL for SNE/MA stock of windowpane flounder. The sub-ACLs for the 2014 fishing year are specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(4)(iii)(E) of the NE multispecies regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accountability measure. (1) Unless otherwise specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv) of the NE multispecies regulations, if the SNE/MA windowpane flounder sub-ACL for the scallop fishery is exceeded and an accountability measure is triggered as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv), the area west of 71 W. long., shall be considered the SNE/MA windowpane flounder gear restricted area. Scallop vessels participating in the DAS, or LAGC IFQ scallop fishery for the period of time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must comply with the gear restrictions specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section when fishing in open areas. This accountability measure does not apply to scallop vessels fishing in Sea Scallop Access Areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv) of the NE multispecies regulations, if the SNE/MA windowpane flounder sub-ACL for the scallop fishery is exceeded and an accountability measure is triggered as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv), the area west of 71 W. long., shall be considered the SNE/MA windowpane flounder gear restricted area. Scallop vessels participating in the DAS, or LAGC IFQ scallop fishery for the period of time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must comply with the gear restrictions specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section when fishing in open areas. This accountability measure does not apply to scallop vessels fishing in Sea Scallop Access Areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duration of gear restricted area. The SNE/MA windowpane flounder accountability measure gear restricted area shall remain in effect for the period of time based on the corresponding percent overage of the SNE/MA windowpane flounder sub-ACL, as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Percent overage of sub-ACL               Length of closure------------------------------------------------------------------------20 or less...........................  February.Greater than 20......................  March and February.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gear restriction. When subject to the SNE/MA windowpane flounder accountability measure gear restricted area as described in paragraphs (b) and (b)(2) of this section, a vessel must fish with scallop dredge gear that conforms to the following restrictions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No more than 5 rows of rings shall be used in the apron of the dredge. The apron is on the top side of the dredge,

extends the full width of the dredge, and is the rows of dredge rings that extend from the back edge of the twine top (i.e., farthest from the dredge frame) to the clubstick; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum hanging ratio for a net, net material, or any other material on the top of a scallop dredge (twine top) possessed or used by vessels fishing with scallop dredge gear does not exceed 1.5:1 overall. An overall hanging ratio of 1.5:1 means that the twine top is attached to the rings in a pattern of alternating 2 meshes per ring and 1 mesh per ring (counted at the bottom where the twine top connects to the apron), for an overall average of 1.5 meshes per ring for the entire width of the twine top. For example, an apron that is 40 rings wide subtracting 5 rings one each side of the side pieces, yielding 30 rings, would only be able to use a twine top with 45 or fewer meshes so that the overall ratio of meshes to rings did not exceed 1.5 (45 meshes/30 rings = 1.5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Vessels may not fish for scallops with trawl gear west of 71 W. Long when the gear restricted area accountability measure is in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process for implementing the AM--(1) If reliable information is available to make a mid-year determination: On or about January 15 of each year, based upon catch and other information available to NMFS, the Regional Administrator shall determine whether the SNE/MA windowpane flounder sub-ACL was exceeded, or is projected to be exceeded, and if an accountability measure was triggered as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv), by scallop vessels prior to the end of the scallop fishing year ending on February 28/29. The determination shall include the amount of the overage or projected amount of the overage, specified as a percentage of the overall sub-ACL for the SNE/MA windowpane flounder stock, in accordance with the values specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Based on this initial determination in mid-January, the Regional Administrator shall implement the AM in the following fishing year in accordance with the APA and attempt to notify owners of limited access and LAGC scallop vessels by letter identifying the length of the gear restricted area and a summary of the SNE/MA windowpane flounder catch, overage, and projection that resulted in the gear restricted area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If reliable information is available to make a mid-year determination: On or about January 15 of each year, based upon catch and other information available to NMFS, the Regional Administrator shall determine whether the SNE/MA windowpane flounder sub-ACL was exceeded, or is projected to be exceeded, and if an accountability measure was triggered as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(iv), by scallop vessels prior to the end of the scallop fishing year ending on February 28/29.

The determination shall include the amount of the overage, specified as a percentage of the overall sub-ACL for the SNE/MA windowpane flounder stock, in accordance with the values specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Based on this information, the Regional Administrator shall implement the AM in accordance with the APA in Year 3 (e.g., an accountability measure would be implemented in fishing year 2016 for an overage that occurred in fishing year 2014) and attempt to notify owners of limited access and LAGC scallop vessels by letter identifying the length of the gear restricted area and a summary of the SNE/MA windowpane flounder catch and overage information.
