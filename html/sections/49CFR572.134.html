                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(iii))</em>. The thorax consists of the part of the torso  assembly shown in drawing 880105-300.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely  assembled dummy (drawing 880105-000) is impacted by a test probe  conforming to section 572.137(a) at 6.71 0.12 m/s  (22.0 0.4 ft/s) according to the test procedure in  subsection (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the  spine, measured with chest deflection transducer (drawing SA572-S5),  must be not less than 50.0 mm (1.97 in) and not more than 58.0 mm (2.30  in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force,  measured by the impact probe as defined in section 572.137 and  calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall  not be less than 3900 N (876 lbf) and not more than 4400 N (989 lbf).  The peak force after 18.0 mm (0.71 in) of sternum displacement but  before reaching the minimum required 50.0 mm (1.97 in) sternum  displacement limit shall not exceed 4600 N.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact as  determined by the plot of force vs. deflection in paragraph (1) of this  section shall be not less than 69 percent but not more than 85 percent.  The hysteresis shall be calculated by determining the ratio of the area  between the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve  to the area under the loading portion of the curve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The force shall be calculated by the product of the impactor  mass and its deceleration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dummy is clothed in a form fitting cotton stretch above-the- elbow sleeved shirt and above-the-knee pants. The weight of the shirt  and pants shall not exceed 0.14 kg (0.30 lb) each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature  between 20.6 and 22.2 [deg]C (69 and 72 [deg]F) and a relative humidity  between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface without back  support as shown in Figure O3, with the limbs extended horizontally and  forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane  vertical within 1 degree and the ribs level in the  anterior-posterior and lateral directions within 0.5 degrees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so  that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe  coincides with the midsagittal plane of the dummy within 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and is 12.7 1.1 mm  (0.5 0.04 in) below the horizontal-peripheral  centerline of the No. 3 rib and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal  line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of  contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a  horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no  significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other  attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make  contact with the dummy during the test.
