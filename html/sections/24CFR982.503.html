The HUD Field Office may approve an exception payment standard amount from above 110 percent of the published FMR to not more than 120 percent of the published FMR (upper range) if the HUD Field Office determines that approval is justified by either the median rent method or the 40th or 50th percentile rent method as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (and that such approval is also supported by an appropriate program justification in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Median rent method. In the median rent method, HUD determines the exception payment standard amount by multiplying the FMR times a fraction of which the numerator is the median gross rent of the exception area and the denominator is the median gross rent of the entire FMR area. In this method, HUD uses median gross rent data from the most recent decennial United States census, and the exception area may be any geographic entity within the FMR area (or any combination of such entities) for which median gross rent data is provided in decennial census products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 40th or 50th percentile rent method. In this method, HUD determines that the area exception payment standard amount equals either the 40th or 50th percentile of rents for standard quality rental housing in the exception area. HUD determines whether the 40th or 50th percentile rent applies in accordance with the methodology described in Sec. 888.113 of this title for determining FMRs. A PHA must present statistically representative rental housing survey data to justify HUD approval.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
