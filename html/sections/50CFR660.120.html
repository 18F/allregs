[76 FR 74740, Dec. 1, 2011]


Sec. 660.130   Trawl fishery--management measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Limited entry trawl vessels are those vessels registered to a limited entry permit with a trawl endorsement and those vessels registered to an MS permit. Most species taken in limited entry trawl fisheries will be managed with quotas (see Sec. 660.140), allocations or set-asides (see Sec. 660.150 or Sec. 660.160), or cumulative trip limits (see

trip limits in Tables 1 (North) and 1 (South) of this subpart), size limits (see Sec. 660.60 (h)(5), subpart C), seasons (see Pacific whiting at Sec. 660.131(b), subpart D), gear restrictions (see paragraph (b) of this section) and closed areas (see paragraph (e) of this section and Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.79, subpart C). The trawl fishery has gear requirements and harvest limits that differ by the type of trawl gear on board and the area fished. Groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception must adhere to CCA restrictions (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section and Sec. 660.70, subpart C). The trip limits in Tables 1 (North) and 1 (South) of this subpart apply to vessels participating in the limited entry groundfish trawl fishery and may not be exceeded. Federal commercial groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state commercial groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Trawl gear requirements and restrictions. Trawl nets may be fished with or without otter boards, and may use warps or cables to herd fish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Codends. Only single-walled codends may be used in any trawl. Double-walled codends are prohibited. Chafing gear may not be used to create a double-walled codend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mesh size. Groundfish trawl gear, including chafing gear, must meet the minimum mesh size requirements in this paragraph. Mesh size requirements apply throughout the net. Minimum trawl mesh sizes are: Bottom trawl, 4.5 inches (11.4 cm); midwater trawl, 3.0 inches (7.6 cm). Minimum trawl mesh size requirements are met if a 20-guage stainless steel wedge, less one thickness of the metal wedge, can be passed with only thumb pressure through at least 16 of 20 sets of two meshes each of wet mesh.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bottom trawl gear--(i) Large footrope trawl gear. Lines or ropes that run parallel to the footrope may not be augmented with material encircling or tied along their length such that they have a diameter larger than 19 inches (48 cm). For enforcement purposes, the footrope will be measured in a straight line from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge at the widest part on any individual part, including any individual disk, roller, bobbin, or any other device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small footrope trawl gear. Lines or ropes that run parallel to the footrope may not be augmented with material encircling or tied along their length such that they have a diameter larger than 8 inches (20 cm). For enforcement purposes, the footrope will be measured in a straight line from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge at the widest part on any individual part, including any individual disk, roller, bobbin, or any other device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Selective flatfish trawl gear. Selective flatfish trawl gear is a type of small footrope trawl gear. The selective flatfish trawl net must be a two-seamed net with no more than two riblines, excluding the codend. The breastline may not be longer than 3 ft (0.92 m) in length. There may be no floats along the center third of the headrope or attached to the top panel except on the riblines. The footrope must be less than 105 ft (32.26 m) in length. The headrope must be not less than 30 percent longer than the footrope. The headrope shall be measured along the length of the headrope from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge. An explanatory diagram of a selective flatfish trawl net is provided as Figure 1 of part 660, subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Chafing gear restrictions for bottom trawl gear. Chafing gear may encircle no more than 50 percent of the net's circumference and may be in one or more sections. Chafing gear may be used only on the last 50 meshes, measured from the terminal (closed) end of the codend. Only the front edge (edge closest to the open end of the codend) and sides of each section of chafing gear may be attached to the codend; except at the corners, the terminal edge (edge closest to the closed end of the codend) of each section of chafing gear must not be attached to the net. Chafing gear must be attached outside any riblines and restraining straps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Midwater (pelagic or off-bottom) trawl gear. Midwater trawl gear must have unprotected footropes at the trawl mouth, and must not have rollers, bobbins, tires, wheels, rubber discs, or any similar device anywhere on any part of the net. The footrope of

midwater gear may not be enlarged by encircling it with chains or by any other means. Ropes or lines running parallel to the footrope of midwater trawl gear must be bare and may not be suspended with chains or any other materials. Sweep lines, including the bottom leg of the bridle, must be bare. For at least 20 ft (6.15 m) immediately behind the footrope or headrope, bare ropes or mesh of 16-inch (40.6-cm) minimum mesh size must completely encircle the net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Chafing gear restrictions for midwater trawl gear. Chafing gear may cover the bottom and sides of the codend in either one or more sections. Only the front edge (edge closest to the open end of the codend) and sides of each section of chafing gear may be attached to the codend; except at the corners, the terminal edge (edge closest to the closed end of the codend) of each section of chafing gear must not be attached to the net. Chafing gear is not permitted on the top codend panel except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Chafing gear exception for midwater trawl gear. A band of mesh (a ``skirt'') may encircle the net under or over transfer cables, lifting or splitting straps (chokers), riblines, and restraining straps, but must be the same mesh size and coincide knot-to-knot with the net to which it is attached and be no wider than 16 meshes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Restrictions by limited entry trawl gear type. Management measures may vary depending on the type of trawl gear (i.e., large footrope, small footrope, selective flatfish, or midwater trawl gear) used and/or on board a vessel during a fishing trip, cumulative limit period, and the area fished. Trawl nets may be used on and off the seabed. For some species or species groups, Table 1 (North) and Table 1 (South) of this subpart provide trip limits that are specific to different types of trawl gear: Large footrope, small footrope (including selective flatfish), selective flatfish, midwater, and multiple types. If Table 1 (North) and Table 1 (South) of this subpart provide gear specific limits for a particular species or species group, it is unlawful to take and retain, possess or land that species or species group with limited entry trawl gears other than those listed. The following restrictions are in addition to the prohibitions at Sec. 660.112(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fishing with large footrope trawl gear. It is unlawful for any vessel using large footrope gear to fish for groundfish shoreward of the RCAs defined at paragraph (e)(4) of this section and at Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.74, subpart C. The use of large footrope gear is permitted seaward of the RCAs coastwide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fishing with small footrope trawl gear. North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., it is unlawful for any vessel using small footrope gear (except selective flatfish gear) to fish for groundfish or have small footrope trawl gear (except selective flatfish gear) onboard while fishing shoreward of the RCA defined at paragraph (e) of this section and at Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.74. South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., small footrope gear is required shoreward of the RCA. Small footrope gear is permitted seaward of the RCA coastwide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., selective flatfish gear is required shoreward of the RCA defined at paragraph (e) of this section and at Sec. Sec. 660.70, through 660.74. South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., selective flatfish gear is permitted, but not required, shoreward of the RCA. The use of selective flatfish trawl gear is permitted seaward of the RCA coastwide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fishing with midwater trawl gear. North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., midwater trawl gear is permitted only for vessels participating in the primary Pacific whiting fishery (for details on the Pacific whiting fishery see Sec. 660.131, subpart D.) South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat., the use of midwater trawl gear is prohibited shoreward of the RCA and permitted seaward of the RCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> More than one type of trawl gear on board. The trip limits in Table 1 (North) or Table 1 (South) of this subpart must not be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following restrictions apply to vessels operating north of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A vessel may not have both groundfish trawl gear and non-groundfish trawl gear onboard simultaneously. A vessel may not have both bottom trawl gear and midwater trawl gear onboard simultaneously. A vessel

may have more than one type of limited entry bottom trawl gear on board, either simultaneously or successively, during a cumulative limit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a vessel fishes exclusively with large or small footrope trawl gear during an entire cumulative limit period, the vessel is subject to the small or large footrope trawl gear cumulative limits and that vessel must fish seaward of the RCA during that limit period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a vessel fishes exclusively with selective flatfish trawl gear during an entire cumulative limit period, then the vessel is subject to the selective flatfish trawl gear-cumulative limits during that limit period, regardless of whether the vessel is fishing shoreward or seaward of the RCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If more than one type of bottom trawl gear (selective flatfish, large footrope, or small footrope) is on board, either simultaneously or successively, at any time during a cumulative limit period, then the most restrictive cumulative limit associated with the bottom trawl gear on board during that cumulative limit period applies for the entire cumulative limit period, regardless of whether the vessel is fishing shoreward or seaward of the RCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If a vessel fishes both north and south of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. with any type of small footrope gear onboard the vessel at any time during the cumulative limit period, the most restrictive trip limit associated with the gear on board applies for that trip and will count toward the cumulative trip limit for that gear (See crossover provisions at Sec. 660.120, subpart D.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Midwater trawl gear is allowed only for vessels participating in the primary whiting season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following restrictions apply to vessels operating south of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A vessel may not have both groundfish trawl gear and non-groundfish trawl gear onboard simultaneously. A vessel may not have both bottom trawl gear and midwater trawl gear onboard simultaneously. A vessel may not have small footrope trawl gear and any other type of bottom trawl gear onboard simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a vessel fishes both north and south of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. with any type of small footrope gear onboard the vessel at any time during the cumulative limit period, the most restrictive trip limit associated with the gear on board applies for that trip and will count toward the cumulative trip limit for that gear (See crossover provisions at Sec. 660.120, subpart D.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sorting. In addition to the requirements at Sec. 660.12(a)(8), the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipt. Sector-specific sorting requirements and exceptions are listed at paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Species and areas--(i) Coastwide. Widow rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, black rockfish, blue rockfish, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish, shortspine and longspine thornyhead, Dover sole, arrowtooth flounder, petrale sole, starry flounder, English sole, other flatfish, lingcod, sablefish, Pacific cod, spiny dogfish, other fish, longnose skate, and Pacific whiting; and big skate in the Shorebased IFQ Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. POP, yellowtail rockfish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. Minor shallow nearshore rockfish, minor deeper nearshore rockfish, California scorpionfish, chilipepper, bocaccio, splitnose rockfish, Pacific sanddabs, cowcod, bronzespotted rockfish, blackgill rockfish and cabezon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sorting requirements for the Shorebased IFQ Program--(i) First receivers. Fish landed at IFQ first receivers (including shoreside processing facilities and buying stations that intend to transport catch for processing elsewhere) must be sorted, prior to first weighing after offloading from the vessel and prior to transport away from the point of landing, with the following exception. Vessels with a valid Shorebased IFQ Program declaration as specified at Sec. 660.13(d)(5)(iv)(A) making an IFQ landing, may weigh catch on a bulk scale or automatic hopper

scale before sorting as described at Sec. 660.140(j)(2)(viii), for Pacific whiting taken with midwater trawl gear, and at Sec. 660.140(j)(2)(ix)(A), for all other IFQ landings. For this exception, all catch in the landing other than the single predominant species must then be reweighed. The weight of a single predominant species is determined by deducting the weight of all other species from the total weight of landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catcher vessels. All catch must be sorted to the species groups specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for vessels with limited entry permits, except those retaining all catch during a IFQ trip. The catch must not be discarded from the vessel and the vessel must not mix catch from hauls until the observer has sampled the catch. Prohibited species must be sorted according to the following species groups: Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, Chinook salmon, other salmon. Non-groundfish species must be sorted as required by the state of landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sorting requirements for the at-sea sectors of the Pacific whiting fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pacific whiting at-sea processing vessels may use an accurate in-line conveyor or hopper type scale to derive an accurate total catch weight prior to sorting. Immediately following weighing of the total catch, the catch must be sorted to the species groups specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and all incidental catch (groundfish and non-groundfish species) must be accurately accounted for and the weight of incidental catch deducted from the total catch weight to derive the weight of a single predominant species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catcher vessels in the MS sector. If sorting occurs on the catcher vessel, the catch must not be discarded from the vessel and the vessel must not mix catch from hauls until the observer has sampled the catch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Groundfish conservation areas (GCAs) applicable to trawl vessels. A GCA, a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees of latitude and longitude. The latitude and longitude coordinates of the GCA boundaries are specified at Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.74. A vessel that is fishing within a GCA listed in this paragraph (e) with trawl gear authorized for use within a GCA may not have any other type of trawl gear on board the vessel. The following GCAs apply to vessels participating in the limited entry trawl fishery. Additional closed areas that specifically apply to the Pacific whiting fisheries are described at Sec. 660.131(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cowcod conservation areas (CCAs). Vessels using limited entry trawl gear are prohibited from fishing within the CCAs. See Sec. 660.70 for the coordinates that define the CCAs. Limited entry trawl vessels may transit through the Western CCA with their gear stowed and groundfish on board only in a corridor through the Western CCA bounded on the north by the latitude line at 33[deg]00.50[min] N. lat., and bounded on the south by the latitude line at 32[deg]59.50[min] N. lat. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish within the CCAs, except as authorized in this paragraph, when those waters are open to fishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Farallon islands. Under California law, commercial fishing for all groundfish is prohibited between the shoreline and the 10 fm (18 m) depth contour around the Farallon Islands. (See Sec. 660.70, subpart C)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cordell Banks. Commercial fishing for groundfish is prohibited in waters of depths less than 100-fm (183-m) around Cordell Banks as defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. 660.70, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Trawl rockfish conservation areas. The trawl RCAs are closed areas, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates which are specified at Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.74, subpart C. Boundaries for the trawl RCAs applicable to groundfish trawl vessels throughout the year are provided in the header to Table 1 (North) and Table 1 (South) of this subpart and may be modified by NMFS inseason pursuant to Sec. 660.60(c), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is unlawful to operate a vessel with trawl gear onboard within the trawl RCA, except for the purpose of continuous transiting, or when the use of trawl gear is authorized in this section. It is lawful to fish with groundfish trawl gear within the trawl RCA only under the following conditions: vessels fishing with midwater trawl gear on Pacific whiting trips during

the primary whiting season, provided a valid declaration report has been filed with NMFS OLE, as required at Sec. 660.12(d), subpart C; and vessels fishing with demersal seine gear between 38[deg] N. lat. and 36[deg] N. lat. shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour as defined at Sec. 660.73, subpart C, provided a valid declaration report has been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trawl vessels may transit through an applicable GCA, with or without groundfish on board, provided all groundfish trawl gear is stowed either: below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all towing lines, so that it is rendered unusable for fishing; or remaining on deck uncovered if the trawl doors are hung from their stanchions and the net is disconnected from the doors. These restrictions do not apply to vessels fishing with midwater trawl gear for whiting during a primary season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with limited entry trawl gear within the trawl RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a vessel fishes in the trawl RCA, it may not participate in any fishing on that trip that is prohibited within the trawl RCA. Nothing in these Federal regulations supersedes any state regulations that may prohibit trawling shoreward of the fishery management area (3-200 nm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Essential fish habitat conservation areas. An EFHCA, a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees of latitude and longitude at Sec. Sec. 660.75 through 660.79, subpart C, where specified types of fishing are prohibited in accordance with Sec. 660.12, subpart C. EFHCAs apply to vessels using bottom trawl gear or to vessels using ``bottom contact gear,'' which is defined at Sec. 660.11, subpart C, to include bottom trawl gear, among other gear types.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following EFHCAs apply to vessels operating within the West Coast EEZ with bottom trawl gear:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Seaward of a boundary line approximating the 700-fm (1280-m) depth contour. Fishing with bottom trawl gear is prohibited in waters of depths greater than 700 fm (1280 m) within the EFH, as defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. Sec. 660.75 and 660.76, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 100-fm (183-m) depth contour. Fishing with bottom trawl gear with a footrope diameter greater than 8 inches (20 cm) is prohibited in waters shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 100-fm (183-m) depth contour, as defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. 660.73, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> EFHCAs for all bottom trawl gear. Fishing with bottom trawl gear is prohibited within the following EFHCAs, which are defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. Sec. 660.77 through 660.78, subpart C: Olympic 2, Biogenic 1, Biogenic 2, Grays Canyon, Biogenic 3, Astoria Canyon, Nehalem Bank/Shale Pile, Siletz Deepwater, Daisy Bank/Nelson Island, Newport Rockpile/Stonewall Bank, Heceta Bank, Deepwater off Coos Bay, Bandon High Spot, Rogue Canyon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> EFHCAs for all bottom trawl gear, except demersal seine gear. Fishing with bottom trawl gear except demersal seine gear (defined at Sec. 660.11, subpart C) is prohibited within the following EFHCAs, which are defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. 660.79, subpart C: Eel River Canyon, Blunts Reef, Mendocino Ridge, Delgada Canyon, Tolo Bank, Point Arena North, Point Arena South Biogenic Area, Cordell Bank/Biogenic Area, Farallon Islands/Fanny Shoal, Half Moon Bay, Monterey Bay/Canyon, Point Sur Deep, Big Sur Coast/Port San Luis, East San Lucia Bank, Point Conception, Hidden Reef/Kidney Bank (within Cowcod Conservation Area West), Catalina Island, Potato Bank (within Cowcod Conservation Area West), Cherry Bank (within Cowcod Conservation Area West), and Cowcod EFH Conservation Area East.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> EFHCAs for bottom contact gear, which includes bottom trawl gear. Fishing with bottom contact gear, including bottom trawl gear is prohibited within the following EFHCAs, which are defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at Sec. Sec. 660.75 through 660.79: Thompson Seamount, President Jackson Seamount, Cordell Bank (50

Sec. 660.131   Pacific whiting fishery management measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sectors--(1) The catcher/processor sector, or C/P Coop Program, is composed of catcher/processors registered to a limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The mothership sector, or MS Coop Program, is composed of motherships and catcher vessels that harvest Pacific whiting for delivery to motherships. Motherships are vessels registered to an MS permit, and catcher vessels are vessels registered to a limited entry permit with an MS/CV endorsement or vessels registered to a limited entry permit without an MS/CV endorsement if the vessel is authorized to harvest the coop's allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Pacific whiting IFQ fishery is composed of vessels that harvest Pacific whiting for delivery shoreside to IFQ first receivers during the primary season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pacific whiting seasons--(1) Primary seasons. The primary seasons for the Pacific whiting fishery are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the Shorebased IFQ Program, Pacific whiting IFQ fishery, the period(s) of the large-scale target fishery is conducted after the season start date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For catcher/processors, the period(s) when catching and at-sea processing is allowed for the catcher/processor sector (after the season closes at-sea processing of any fish already on board the processing vessel is allowed to continue); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For vessels delivering to motherships, the period(s) when catching and at-sea processing is allowed for the mothership sector (after the season closes at-sea processing of any fish already on board the processing vessel is allowed to continue).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Different primary season start dates. North of 40[deg]30[min] N. lat., different starting dates may be established for the catcher/processor sector, the mothership sector, and in the Pacific whiting IFQ fishery for vessels delivering to IFQ first receivers north of 42[deg] N. lat. and vessels delivering to IFQ first receivers between 42[deg] through 40[deg]30[min] N. lat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Procedures. The primary seasons for the whiting fishery north of 40[deg]3[min] N. lat. generally will be established according to the procedures of the PCGFMP for developing and implementing harvest specifications and apportionments. The season opening dates remain in effect unless changed, generally with the harvest specifications and management measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Criteria. The start of a primary season may be changed based on a recommendation from the Council and consideration of the following factors, if applicable: Size of the harvest guidelines for whiting and bycatch species; age/size structure of the whiting population; expected harvest of bycatch and prohibited species; availability and stock status of prohibited species; expected participation by catchers and processors; the period between when catcher vessels make annual processor obligations and the start of the fishery; environmental conditions; timing of alternate or competing fisheries; industry agreement; fishing or processing rates; and other relevant information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Primary whiting season start dates and duration. After the start of a primary season for a sector of the whiting fishery, the season remains open for that sector until the sector allocation of whiting or non-whiting groundfish (with allocations) is reached or projected to be reached and the fishery season for that sector is closed by NMFS. The starting dates for the primary seasons for the whiting fishery are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Catcher/processor sector--May 15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Mothership sector--May 15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Shorebased IFQ Program.

The ``per trip'' limit for whiting before the regular (primary) season for the shorebased sector is announced in Table 1 of this subpart, and is a routine management measure under Sec. 660.60(c). This trip limit includes any whiting caught shoreward of 100-fm (183-m) in the Eureka, CA area. The ``per trip'' limit for other groundfish species for the shorebased sector are announced in Table 1 (North) and Table 1 (South) of this subpart and apply as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the groundfish cumulative limit periods both before and after the primary whiting season, vessels may use either small and/or large footrope gear, but are subject to the more restrictive trip limits for those entire cumulative periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, during a primary whiting season, a whiting vessel harvests a groundfish species other than whiting for which there is a midwater trip limit, then that vessel may also harvest up to another footrope-specific limit for that species during any cumulative limit period that overlaps the start or close of the primary whiting season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Closed areas. Vessels fishing in the Pacific whiting primary seasons for the Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Coop Program, or C/P Coop Program shall not target Pacific whiting with midwater trawl gear in the following portions of the fishery management area:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Klamath river salmon conservation zone. The ocean area surrounding the Klamath River mouth bounded on the north by 41[deg]38.80[min] N. lat. (approximately 6 nm north of the Klamath River mouth), on the west by 124[deg]23[min] W. long. (approximately 12 nm from shore), and on the south by 41[deg]26.80[min] N. lat. (approximately 6 nm south of the Klamath River mouth).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Columbia river salmon conservation zone. The ocean area surrounding the Columbia River mouth bounded by a line extending for 6 nm due west from North Head along 46[deg]18[min] N. lat. to 124[deg]13.30[min] W. long., then southerly along a line of 167 True to 46[deg]11.10[min] N. lat. and 124[deg]11[min] W. long. (Columbia River Buoy), then northeast along Red Buoy Line to the tip of the south jetty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ocean salmon conservation zone. All waters shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour. Latitude and longitude coordinates defining the boundary line approximating the 100 fm (183 m) depth contour are provided at Sec. 660.73, subpart C. This closure will be implemented through automatic action, defined at Sec. 660.60(d), subpart C, when NMFS projects the Pacific whiting fishery may take in excess of 11,000 Chinook within a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pacific whiting bycatch reduction areas (BRAs). Vessels using limited entry midwater trawl gear during the primary whiting season may be prohibited from fishing shoreward of a boundary line approximating the 75-fm (137-m), 100-fm (183-m) or 150-fm (274-m) depth contours. Latitude and longitude coordinates for the boundary lines approximating the depth contours are provided at Sec. Sec. 660.72 and 660.73. Closures may be implemented inseason for a sector(s) through automatic action, defined at Sec. 660.60(d), when NMFS projects that a sector will exceed an allocation for a non-whiting groundfish species specified for that sector before the sector's whiting allocation is projected to be reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eureka area trip limits. Trip landing or frequency limits may be established, modified, or removed under Sec. 660.60 or this paragraph, specifying the amount of Pacific whiting that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100 fathom (183 m) contour (as shown on NOAA Charts 18580, 18600, and 18620) in the Eureka area (from 43[deg]00[min] to 40[deg]30[min] N. lat.). Unless otherwise specified, no more than 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) of whiting may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100 fm (183 m) contour (as shown on NOAA Charts 18580, 18600, and 18620) in the Eureka management area (defined at Sec. 660.11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> At-sea processing. Whiting may not be processed at sea south of 42[deg]00[min] N. lat. (Oregon-California border), unless

by a waste-processing vessel as authorized under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Time of day. Vessels fishing in the Pacific whiting primary seasons for the Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Coop Program or C/P Coop Program shall not target Pacific whiting with midwater trawl gear in the fishery management area south of 42[deg]00[min] N. lat. between 0001 hours to one-half hour after official sunrise (local time). During this time south of 42[deg]00[min] N. lat., trawl doors must be on board any vessel used to fish for whiting and the trawl must be attached to the trawl doors. Official sunrise is determined, to the nearest 5[deg] lat., in The Nautical Almanac issued annually by the Nautical Almanac Office, U.S. Naval Observatory, and available from the U.S. Government Printing Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Processing fish waste at sea. A vessel that processes only fish waste (a ``waste-processing vessel'') is not considered a whiting processor and therefore is not subject to the allocations, seasons, or restrictions for catcher/processors or motherships while it operates as a waste-processing vessel. However, no vessel may operate as a waste-processing vessel 48 hours immediately before and after a primary season for whiting in which the vessel operates as a catcher/processor or mothership. A vessel must meet the following conditions to qualify as a waste-processing vessel:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The vessel makes meal (ground dried fish), oil, or minced (ground flesh) product, but does not make, and does not have on board, surimi (fish paste with additives), fillets (meat from the side of the fish, behind the head and in front of the tail), or headed and gutted fish (head and viscera removed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of whole whiting on board does not exceed the trip limit (if any) allowed under Sec. 660.60(c), subpart C, or Tables 1 (North) or 1 (South) in subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any trawl net and doors on board are stowed in a secured and covered manner, and detached from all towing lines, so as to be rendered unusable for fishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The vessel does not receive codends containing fish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The vessel's operations are consistent with applicable state and Federal law, including those governing disposal of fish waste at sea.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reapportionment of Pacific whiting. (1) Upon receipt of written notice to the Regional Administrator from the tribe(s) participating in the fishery that they do not intend to use a portion of the tribal allocation, the Regional Administrator may, no earlier than 7 days following notice to other treaty tribes with rights to whiting, reapportion any remainder to the other sectors of the trawl fishery as soon as practicable after receiving such notice. If no such reapportionment has occurred prior to September 15 of the fishing year, the Regional Administrator will, based on discussions with representatives of the tribes participating in the Pacific whiting fishery for that fishing year, consider the tribal harvests to date and catch projections for the remainder of the year relative to the tribal allocation of Pacific whiting, as specified at Sec. 660.50. That portion of the tribal allocation that the Regional Administrator determines will not be used by the end of the fishing year may be reapportioned to the other sectors of the trawl fishery on September 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. Subsequent reapportionments may be made based on subsequent determinations by the Regional Administrator based on the factors described above in order to ensure full utilization of the resource. However, no reapportionments will occur after December 1 of the fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NMFS will reapportion unused tribal allocation to the other sectors of the trawl fishery in proportion to their initial allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The reapportionment of surplus whiting will be made effective immediately by actual notice under the automatic action authority provided at Sec. 660.60(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Estimates of the portion of the tribal allocation that will not be used by the end of the fishing year will be

based on the best information available to the Regional Administrator.
