                                Sec. 779.372  Nonmanufacturing establishments with certain exempt
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A specific exemption from only the overtime pay  provisions of section 7 of the Act is provided in section 13(b)(10) for  certain employees of nonmanufacturing establishments engaged in the  business of selling automobiles, trucks, farm implements, trailers,  boats, or aircraft. Section 13(b)(10)(A) states that the provisions of  section 7 shall not apply with respect to ``any salesman, partsman, or  mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks,  or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing  establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles  or implements to ultimate purchasers.'' Section 13(b)(10)(B) states that  the provisions of section 7 shall not apply with respect to ``any  salesman primarily engaged in selling trailers, boats, or aircraft, if  he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in  the business of selling trailers, boats, or aircraft to ultimate  purchasers.'' This exemption will apply irrespective of the annual  dollar volume of sales of the establishment or of the enterprise of  which it is a part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Character of establishment and employees exempted. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  establishment will qualify for this exemption if the following two tests  are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The establishment must not be engaged in manufacturing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The establishment must be primarily engaged in the business of  selling automobiles, trucks, or farm implements to the ultimate  purchaser for section 13(b)(10)(A) to apply. If these tests are met by  an establishment the exemption will be available for salesmen, partsmen  and mechanics, employed by the establishment, who are primarily engaged  during the work week in the selling or servicing of the named items.  Likewise, the establishment must be primarily engaged in the business of  selling trailers, boats, or aircraft to the ultimate purchaser for the  section 13(b)(10)(B) exemption to be available for salesmen employed by  the establishment who are primarily engaged during the work week in  selling these named items. An explanation of the term ``employed by'' is  contained in Sec. Sec. 779.307 through 779.311. The exemption is  intended to apply to employment by such an establishment of the  specified categories of employees even if they work in physically  separate buildings or areas, or even if, though working in the principal  building of the dealership, their work relates to the work of physically  separate buildings or areas, so long as they are employed in a  department which is functionally operated as part of the dealership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This exemption, unlike the former exemption in section 13(a)(19)  of the Act prior to the 1966 amendments, is not limited to dealerships  that qualify as retail or service establishments nor is it limited to  establishments selling automobiles, trucks, and farm implements, but  also includes dealers in trailers, boats, and aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Salesman, partsman, or mechanic. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As used in section  13(b)(10)(A), a salesman is an employee who is employed for the purpose  of and is primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or  contracts for sale of the automobiles, trucks, or farm implements that  the establishment is primarily engaged in selling. As used in section  13(b)(10)(B), a salesman is an employee who is employed for the purpose  of and is primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or  contracts for sale of trailers, boats, or aircraft that the  establishment is primarily engaged in selling. Work performed incidental  to and in conjunction with the employee's own sales or solicitations,  including incidental deliveries and collections, is regarded as within  the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in section 13(b)(10)(A), a partsman is any employee  employed for the purpose of and primarily engaged in requisitioning,  stocking, and dispensing parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As used in section 13(b)(10)(A), a mechanic is any employee  primarily engaged in doing mechanical work (such as get ready mechanics,  automotive, truck, or farm implement mechanics, used car reconditioning  mechanics, and wrecker mechanics) in the servicing of an automobile,  truck or farm implement for its use and operation as such. This includes  mechanical work required for safe operation,   as an automobile, truck, or farm implement. The term does not include  employees primarily performing such nonmechanical work as washing,  cleaning, painting, polishing, tire changing, installing seat covers,  dispatching, lubricating, or other nonmechanical work. Wrecker mechanic  means a service department mechanic who goes out on a tow or wrecking  truck to perform mechanical servicing or repairing of a customer's  vehicle away from the shop, or to bring the vehicle back to the shop for  repair service. A tow or wrecker truck driver or helper who primarily  performs nonmechanical repair work is not exempt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Primarily engaged. As used in section 13(b)(10), primarily  engaged means the major part or over 50 percent of the salesman's,  partsman's, or mechanic's time must be spent in selling or servicing the  enumerated vehicles. As applied to the establishment, primarily engaged  means that over half of the establishments annual dollar volume of sales  made or business done must come from sales of the enumerated vehicles.
