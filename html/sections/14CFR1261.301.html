                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended  (see 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680), and subject to its limitations, the  Administrator or designee is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust,  determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against  the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or  death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any NASA  employee while acting within   the scope of his/her office or employment, under circumstances where the  United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in  accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.  In exercising such authority, the Administrator or designee is required  to act in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General  (28 CFR part 14). An award, compromise, or settlement in excess of  $25,000 may be effected only with the prior written approval of the  Attorney General or designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under sec. 203(c)(13)(A) of the National Aeronautics and Space  Act of 1958, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(13)(A), NASA is authorized to  consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, settle, and pay, on behalf of  the United States, in full satisfaction thereof, any claim for $25,000  or less against the United States for bodily injury, death or damage to  or loss of real or personal property resulting from the conduct of  NASA's functions as specified in 42 U.S.C. 2473(a). At the discretion of  NASA, a claim may be settled and paid under this authority even though  the United States could not be held legally liable to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(13)(A)</em>, NASA may report the facts and circumstances of  the claim to the Congress for its consideration or to the Comptroller  General as provided in the ``Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1978,''  Pub. L. 95-240 (92 Stat. 107), 31 U.S.C. 724a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under 28 U.S.C. 2679, the Attorney General of the United States  shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against  a Government employee for injury or loss of property or personal injury  or death, resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle by the  Government employee while acting within the scope of office or  employment. In effect, this legislation is designed to protect an  employee driving a motor vehicle on Government business by converting  such a civil court action or proceeding against the employee into a  claim against the United States: Provided, That the employee was acting  within the scope of employment at the time of the accident. The remedy  against the United States provided by 28 U.S.C. 2672 (administrative  adjustment of claims) and 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) (civil action against the  United States) then becomes the plaintiff's exclusive remedy.</p>
