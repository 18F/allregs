                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an OTRB makes an intermediate or rest stop, a passenger  with a disability, including an individual using a wheelchair, shall be  permitted to leave and return to the bus on the same basis as other  passengers. The operator shall ensure that assistance is provided to  passengers with disabilities as needed to enable the passenger to get on  and off the bus at the stop (e.g., operate the lift and provide  assistance with securement; provide other boarding assistance if needed,  as in the case of a wheelchair user who has transferred to a vehicle  seat because other wheelchair users occupied all securement locations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an OTRB operator owns, leases, or controls the facility at  which a rest or intermediate stop is made, or if an OTRB operator  contracts with the person who owns, leases, or controls such a facility  to provide rest stop services, the OTRB operator shall ensure the  facility complies fully with applicable requirements of the Americans  with Disabilities Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an OTRB equipped with an inaccessible restroom is making an  express run of three hours or more without a rest stop, and a passenger  with a disability who is unable to use the inaccessible restroom  requests an unscheduled rest stop, the operator shall make a good faith  effort to accommodate the request. The operator is not required to make  the stop. However, if the operator does not make the stop, the operator  shall explain to the passenger making the request the reason for its  decision not to do so.</p>
