                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the revocation hearing shall be to determine  whether the parolee has violated the conditions of his release and, if  so, whether his parole or mandatory release should be revoked or  reinstated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The alleged violator may present witnesses, and documentary  evidence in his behalf. However, the presiding hearing officer or  examiner panel may limit or exclude any irrelevant or repetitious  statement or documentary evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At a local revocation hearing, the Commission may on the request  of the alleged violator or on its own motion, request the attendance of  persons who have given statements upon which revocation may be based.  Those witnesses who are present shall be made available for questioning  and cross-examination in the presence of the alleged violator unless the  presiding hearing officer or examiner panel finds good   cause for their non-attendance. Adverse witnesses will not be requested  to appear at institutional revocation hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All evidence upon which the finding of violation may be based  shall be disclosed to the alleged violator at or before the revocation  hearing. The hearing officer or examiner panel may disclose documentary  evidence by permitting the alleged violator to examine the document  during the hearing, or where appropriate, by reading or summarizing the  document in the presence of the alleged violator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of an attorney, an alleged violator may be represented  at a revocation hearing by a person of his choice. However, the role of  such non-attorney representative shall be limited to offering a  statement on the alleged violator's behalf with regard to reparole or  reinstatement to supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A revocation decision may be appealed under the provisions of  Sec.  2.26 or Sec.  2.27 as applicable.
