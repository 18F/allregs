                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity  (additional intermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a  Federal department or agency might divide ``Crisis Management'' into  two, three, or more levels as suits its needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Stage 3, Planning and Preparation. During the planning and  preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR  plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related  responsibilities in   accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of  problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with  possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be  undertaken to overcome identified problems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stage 2, Crisis Management. During the crisis management stage,  GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of  an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional  data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities.  Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for  the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's  area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that  increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could  be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items,  especially those that can be used even if the situation does not  escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be  considered for implementation at this time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through  reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new  funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national  emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile  items for future use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stage 1, National Emergency/War. During a national emergency or  declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and  GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military  requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be  focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting  non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense  uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production.  Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity  may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for  most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency  responsibilities.</p>
