                            <p class="depth0">Example 1. Mr. J, who became age 65 and otherwise eligible for enrollment in November 1965, first enrolls in March 1968. The months to be included in determining the amount of the increase in Mr. J's premiums begin with June 1966 (the first month after the close of his initial enrollment period) and extend through December 1967 (the period January through March of 1968 is excluded in determining the total months) for a total of 19 months. Since there is only one full 12-month period in 19 months, Mr. J's premiums will be 10 percent greater than if he had enrolled in his initial enrollment period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Mr. V, who enrolled in December 1965, voluntarily terminates his enrollment effective midnight December 31, 1967. He enrolls for a second time in January 1969. The months to be included in determining the amount of the increase in Mr. V's premiums are January 1968 through March 1969, a total of 15 months. Since this totals one full 12-month period. Mr. V's monthly premium, will be increased by 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Ms. N becomes age 65 in July 1965 and first enrolls in December 1967. She pays premiums increased by 10 percent above the regular rate, beginning July 1968, the first month of her SMI coverage. Ms. N fails to pay the premiums for the calendar quarter ending June 30, 1970, and her coverage is terminated on that date, the end of her grace period. Ms. N enrolls for a second time in January 1971. The months to be included in determining the amount of the increase in Ms. N's premiums are June 1966 through December 1967, a total of 19 months, and July 1970 through March 1971, a total of 9 months, for a grand total of 28 months. Since this totals two full 12-month periods, Ms. N's monthly premium will be increased by 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Mr. X attained age 65 in August 1966 and enrolled during his initial enrollment period. His coverage was terminated effective June 30, 1968, for nonpayment of premiums. He reenrolls in March 1973. For purposes of computing any applicable premium increase, he will not be charged any months between March 1971 (the end of the last general enrollment period during which he was eligible to reenroll under the law in effect before October 30, 1972) and January 1973. Therefore, he will be charged 36 months (July 1968-March 1971 plus January 1973-March 1973) and his premiums for his second period of coverage will be increased 30 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Ms. C, who attained age 65 in August 1973, had two periods of supplementary medical insurance coverage, both of which were terminated because of nonpayment of premiums: August 1973 through April 1975 and July 1977 through August 1978.

She reenrolls in July 1981. The months to be included in determining the amount of premium increase are May 1975 through March 1977 (23 months) and April 1981 through July 1981 (4 months) for a total of 27 months. The 31 months from September 1978 through March 1981 may not be counted because Ms. C was prevented from reenrolling by the two-enrollment limitation in effect before April 1, 1981. For Ms. C, the standard monthly premium would be increased by 20 percent.
