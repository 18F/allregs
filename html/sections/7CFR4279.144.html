                            <p class="depth0">Lenders will be responsible for ensuring that appraisal values adequately reflect the actual value of the collateral. All real property appraisals associated with Agency guaranteed loanmaking and servicing transactions will meet the requirements contained in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989 and the appropriate guidelines contained in Standards 1 and 2 of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). In accordance with USPAP, the Agency will require documentation that the appraiser has the necessary experience and competency to appraise the property in question. All appraisals will include consideration of the potential effects from a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products or other environmental hazards on the market value of the collateral. For additional guidance and information concerning the completion of real property appraisals, refer to ``Standard Practices for Environmental Site Assessments: Transaction Screen Questionnaire'' and ``Phase I Environmental Site Assessment,'' both published by the American Society of Testing and Materials. Chattels will be evaluated in accordance with normal banking practices and generally accepted methods of determining value.
