                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Analyzers. The following instruments are required for analyzing the measured gases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carbon Monoxide (CO) analysis. (i) The carbon monoxide analyzer must be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carbon Dioxide (CO2) analysis. (i) The carbon dioxide analyzer must be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hydrocarbon (HC) analysis. (i) The hydrocarbon analyzer must be of the heated flame ionization (HFID) type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the temperature of the exhaust gas at the sample probe is below 190 C, the temperature of the valves, pipework, and so forth, must be controlled so as to maintain a wall temperature of 190 C [11 C. If the temperature of the exhaust gas at the sample probe is above 190 C, the temperature of the valves, pipework, and so forth, must be controlled so as to maintain a wall temperature greater than 180 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The FID oven must be capable of maintaining temperature within 5.5 C of the set point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fuel and burner air must conform to the specifications in Sec. 89.312.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The percent of oxygen interference must be less than 3 percent, as specified in Sec. 89.319(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) analysis. (i) This analysis device must consist of the subsequent items, following the sample probe, in the given order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pipework, valves, and so forth, controlled so as to maintain a wall temperature above 60 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A NO2 to NO converter. The NO2 to NO converter efficiency must be at least 90 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For raw analysis, an ice bath or other cooling device located after the NOX converter (optional for dilute analysis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A chemiluminescent detector (CLD or HCLD).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The quench interference must be less than 3.0 percent as measured in Sec. 89.318.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other gas analyzers yielding equivalent results may be used with advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The following requirements must be incorporated in each system used for testing under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made on a dry basis (for raw exhaust measurement only). Specific requirements for the means of drying the sample can be found in Sec. 89.309(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calibration or span gases for the NOX measurement system must pass through the NO2 to NO converter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the equipment must be on a level as to minimize additional errors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Gas drying. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method of removing water from the sample. Water removal by condensation is acceptable. A water trap performing this function and meeting the specifications in Sec. 89.308(b) is an acceptable method. Means other than condensation may be used only with prior approval from the Administrator.
