                                Sec. 120.1860  How will the SISMBD Loan be disbursed?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the FTA by SBA to be applied  to the purchase price for the Guaranteed Portions or Certificates being  purchased by the SISMBD. Disbursement to the FTA is contingent upon  receipt by SBA, the FTA or SBA's settlement agent or custodian of the  Guaranteed Portions or Certificates being purchased and any other  Collateral required by SBA and verification of the required first lien  position. SBA will advance the principal amount or the purchase price of  the Guaranteed Portion or the Certificate, whichever is less. Thus, if  the loan is purchased at a discount to the principal balance, SBA will  not advance more than the purchase price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provided an SISMBD has executed all required loan documents,  when an SISMBD requests an advance under its SISMBD Loan, it will submit  a written Loan Advance Request Form to the FTA and SBA along with the  SBA Form 1086 or 1088 for processing. The FTA will notify SBA that a  particular SISMBD requests an advance of a certain amount of funds on a  specific settlement date to purchase: a Guaranteed Portion which will be  evidenced   by an Individual Certificate, a Pool Certificate, or an existing  Individual Certificate. Provided that the SISMBD has met all of the  terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements, related documents, and  these regulations, and is not in default under the loan documents, on  the settlement date for the SBA Secondary Market transaction, SBA will  wire the funds to the FTA. The FTA will use loan proceeds and any  Premium payment from the SISMBD to pay the SBA Lender or Registered  Holder the purchase price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The SISMBD must identify the SBA Lender or Registered Holder  expected to deliver to SBA or its settlement agent the Guaranteed  Portions or Certificates that are being purchased with SISMBD Loan  proceeds, and upon delivery the Guaranteed Portions or Certificates will  become Collateral for the SISMBD Loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On the SBA Secondary Market transaction settlement date, the SBA  Lender or Registered Holder will deliver the purchased Guaranteed  Portion or Certificate to the FTA or SBA's settlement agent. The FTA or  SBA's settlement agent will use loan proceeds and any Premium payment  from SISMBD to pay the SBA Lender or the Registered Holder the purchase  price upon delivery of all Guaranteed Portions or Certificates that  collateralize the SISMBD Loan to the FTA or SBA's settlement agent and  the Guaranteed Portions or Certificates will be placed in a custodial  account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon settlement the FTA, SBA, SBA's settlement agent and the  administrator of the custodial account will register the loan advance  and collateral pledge on their respective books and records.</p>
