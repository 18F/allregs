                                Sec. 4.117  Work subject to requirements of Walsh-Healey Act.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act, in paragraph (2) of section 7, exempts from its  provisions ``any work required to be done in accordance with the  provision of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act'' (49 Stat. 2036, 41  U.S.C. 35 et seq.). It will be noted that like the similar provision in  the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 329(b)),  this is an exemption for ``work'', i.e., specifications or requirements,  rather than for ``contracts'' subject to the Walsh-Healey Act. The  purpose of the exemption was to eliminate possible overlapping of the  differing labor standards of the two Acts, which otherwise might be  applied to employees performing work on a contract covered by the  Service Contract Act if such contract and their work under it should  also be deemed to be covered by the Walsh-Healey Act. The Walsh-Healey  Act applies to contracts in excess of $10,000 for the manufacture or  furnishing of materials, supplies, articles or equipment. Thus, there is  no overlap if the principal purpose of the contract is the manufacture  or furnishing of such materials etc., rather than the furnishing of  services of the character referred to in the Service Contract Act, for  such a contract is not within the general coverage of the Service  Contract Act. In such cases the exemption in section 7(2) is not  pertinent. See, for example, the discussion in Sec. Sec. 4.131 and  4.132.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this  section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Major overhaul of an item, piece of equipment, or materiel which  is degraded or inoperable, and under which all of the following  conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The item or equipment is required to be completely or  substantially torn down into individual components parts; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Substantially all of the parts are reworked, rehabilitated,  altered and/or replaced; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The parts are reassembled so as to furnish a totally rebuilt  item or piece of equipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Manufacturing processes similar to those which were used in the  manufacturing of the item or piece of equipment are utilized; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The disassembled componets, if usable (except for situations  where the number of items or pieces of equipment involved are too few to  make it practicable) are commingled with existing inventory and, as  such, lose their identification with respect to a particular piece of  equipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The items or equipment overhauled are restored to original life  expectancy, or nearly so; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Such work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the  contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Major modification of an item, piece of equipment, or materiel  which is wholly or partially obsolete, and under which all of the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The item or equipment is required to be completely or  substantially torn down; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outmoded parts are replaced; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The item or equipment is rebuilt or reassembled; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The contract work results in the furnishing of a substantially  modified item in a usable and serviceable condition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the  contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> is subject to the Service  Contract Act.
