                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. At any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss, any party may serve on any other party a request to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Produce and permit the party making the request, or a person acting on his or her behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents, or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, either by individual item or by category and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. It shall specify a reasonable time, place and manner of making the inspection and performing related acts. The party upon whom the request is served shall serve

a written response within 30 days after service of the request, unless the requesting party allows a longer time. The Commission or Judge may allow a shorter time or a longer time, should the requesting party deny an extension. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to in whole or in part, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, that part shall be specified. To obtain a ruling on an objection by the responding party, the requesting party shall file a motion with the Judge and shall annex thereto his request, together with the response and objections, if any.
