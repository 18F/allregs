                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. (1) General. The Office of Administrative Law Judges  has jurisdiction to hear and decide appeals pursuant to Sec. 9.31(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  of this part concerning questions of law and fact from determinations of  the Administrator issued under Sec. 9.31 of this part. In considering  the matters within the scope of its jurisdiction, the Administrative Law  Judge shall act as the authorized representative of the Secretary and  shall act fully and, subject to an appeal filed under Sec. 9.32(b)(2)  of this part, finally on behalf of the Secretary concerning such  matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limit on scope of review. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrative Law Judge shall  not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of any provision of this  part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Equal Access to Justice Act, as amended, does not apply to  hearings under this part. Accordingly, an Administrative Law Judge shall  have no authority to award attorney fees and/or other litigation  expenses pursuant to the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act  for any proceeding under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scheduling. If the case is not stayed to attempt settlement in  accordance with Sec. 9.33(a) of this part, the Administrative Law Judge  to whom the case is assigned shall, within 15 calendar days following  receipt of the request for hearing, notify the parties and any  representatives, of the day, time, and place for hearing. The date of  the hearing shall not be more than 60 days from the date of receipt of  the request for hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dismissing challenges for failure to participate. The  Administrative Law Judge may, at the request of a party or on his/her  own motion, dismiss a challenge to a determination of the Administrator  upon the failure of the party requesting a hearing or his/her  representative to attend a hearing without good cause; or upon the  failure of said party to comply with a lawful order of the  Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrator's participation. At the Administrator's  discretion, the Administrator has the right to participate as a party or  as amicus curiae at any time in the proceedings, including the right to  petition for review of a decision of an Administrative Law Judge in a  case in which the Administrator has not previously participated. The  Administrator shall participate as a party in any proceeding in which  the Administrator has found any violation of this part, except where the  complainant or other interested party challenges only the amount of  monetary relief. See also Sec. 9.32(b)(2)(i)(C) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agency participation. A Federal agency that is interested in a  proceeding may participate, at the agency's discretion, as amicus curiae  at any time in the proceedings. At the request of such Federal agency,  copies of all pleadings in a case shall be served on the Federal agency,  whether or not the agency is participating in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requesting documents. Copies of the request for hearing and  documents filed in all cases, whether or not the Administrator is  participating in the proceeding, shall be sent to the Administrator,  Wage and Hour Division, and to the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair  Labor Standards, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rules of practice. (1) The rules of practice and procedure for  administrative hearings before the Office of Administrative Law Judges  at 29 CFR part 18, subpart A, shall be applicable to the proceedings  provided by this section. This part is controlling to the extent it  provides any rules of special application that may be inconsistent with  the rules in 29 CFR part 18, subpart A. The Rules of Evidence at 29 CFR  18, subpart B, shall not apply. Rules or principles designed to assure  production of the most probative evidence available shall be applied.  The Administrative Law Judge may exclude evidence that is immaterial,  irrelevant, or unduly repetitive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decisions. The Administrative Law Judge shall issue a decision  within 60 days after completion of the proceeding at which evidence was  submitted. The decision shall contain appropriate findings, conclusions,  and an order and be served upon all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Orders. Upon the conclusion of the hearing and the issuance of a  decision that a violation has occurred, the Administrative Law Judge  shall issue an order that the successor contractor take appropriate  action to abate the violation, which may include hiring each affected  employee in a position on the contract for which the employee is  qualified, together with compensation (including lost wages), terms,  conditions, and privileges of that employment. Where the Administrator  has sought ineligibility sanctions, the order shall also address whether  such sanctions are appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Costs. If an order finding the successor contractor violated  this part is issued, the Administrative Law Judge may assess against the  contractor a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs (not  including attorney fees) and expenses reasonably incurred by the  aggrieved employee(s) in the proceeding. This amount shall be awarded in  addition to any unpaid wages or other relief due under Sec. 9.24(b) of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Finality. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall  become the final order of the Secretary, unless a petition for review is  timely filed with the Administrative Review Board as set forth in Sec.  9.32(b)(2) of this part.</p>
