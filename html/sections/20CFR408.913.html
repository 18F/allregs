                            <p class="depth0">We will waive recovery of an overpayment when you are without fault (as defined in Sec. 408.912) and recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of the title VIII program. Recovery of an overpayment would defeat the purpose of the title VIII program to the extent that our recovery action would deprive you of income and resources you need to meet your ordinary and necessary living expenses as described in Sec. 404.508(a) of this chapter.</p>
