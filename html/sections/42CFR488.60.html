                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consideration for approval. An ESRD facility that wishes to be  approved or that wishes an expansion of dialysis services to be approved  for coverage, in accordance with part 494 of this chapter, must secure a  determination by the Secretary. To secure a determination, the facility  must submit the following documents and data for consideration by the  Secretary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification by the State agency referred to in Sec. 488.12 of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data furnished by ESRD network organizations and recommendations  of the Public Health Service concerning the facility's contribution to  the ESRD services of the network.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data concerning the facility's compliance with professional  norms and standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Data pertaining to the facility's qualifications for approval or  for any expansion of services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining compliance with minimal utilization rates: Time  limitations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unconditional status. A facility which meets minimal  utilization requirements will be assigned this status as long as it  continues to meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conditional status. A conditional status may be granted to a  facility for not more than four consecutive calendar years and will not  be renewable (see Sec. 405.2122(b) of this chapter). Its status may be  examined each calendar year to ascertain its compliance with Subpart U.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception status. Under unusual circumstances (see Sec.  405.2122 (b) of this chapter) the Secretary may grant a time-limited  exception to a facility which is not in compliance with the minimal  utilization rate(s) for either unconditional status or conditional  status. This exception status may be granted, and may be renewed on an  annual basis, under circumstances where rigid application of minimal  utilization rate requirements would adversely affect the achievement of  ESRD program objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New applicant. A facility which has not previously participated  in the ESRD program must submit a plan detailing how it expects to meet  the conditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the second  calendar year of its operation under the program and meet the  unconditional minimal utilization rate status by the end of the fourth  calendar year of its operation under the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification. The Secretary will notify each facility and its  network coordinating council of its initial and its subsequent minimal  utilization rate classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to meet minimal utilization rate. A facility failing to  meet standards for unconditional status or conditional status, or if  applicable, for exception status, will be so notified at the time of  such classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interim regulations participant. A facility previously  participating under the interim regulations will not be approved under  the program established by subpart U until it has demonstrated that it  meets all the applicable requirements of this subpart, including the  appropriate minimal utilization rate. It may continue under the interim  program only for a period not to exceed 1 year from the effective date  of these amendments (see Sec. 405.2100(c) of this chapter). During this  period it   may demonstrate its ability to meet the appropriate minimal utilization  rate. Failure to qualify under this subpart will automatically terminate  coverage of such facility's services under the ESRD program at the end  of such year.  [41 FR 22510, June 3, 1976.
