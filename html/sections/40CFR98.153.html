                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The mass of HFC-23 generated from each HCFC-22 production process shall be estimated by using one of two methods, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and another reaction product (e.g., HCl) is measured, multiply the weekly (or more frequent) HFC-23 concentration measurement (which may be the average of more frequent concentration measurements) by the weekly (or more frequent) mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and the other product. To estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. This calculation is summarized in Equation O-1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.051

To estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. This calculation is summarized in Equation O-2 of this section, assuming that the other product is HCFC-22.
