                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance  Directorate may make a Special Community Disaster Loan to any local  government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other  revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need  for Federal financial assistance in order to provide essential services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of loan. The amount of the loan is based upon need, not  to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for  the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs. The term fiscal year as  used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate. The interest rate is the rate for five year  maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on  the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the  monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into  consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable  obligations of the United States. If an applicant can demonstrate  unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the Assistant  Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a rate  equal to the five year maturity rate plus 1 per centum, adjusted to the  nearest \1/8\ percent, and further reduced by one-half.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time limitation. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster  Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in  which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following  that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Term of loan. The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise  extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance  Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance  Directorate may consider a request for an extension of a loan based on  the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan  under section 417(a) of the Stafford Act normally may not exceed 10  years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when  extenuating circumstances exist and the recipient demonstrates an  inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to  repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be  provided for loan repayment (see Sec. 206.377(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of loan funds. The local government shall use the loaned  funds to assist in providing essential services. The funds shall not be  used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of  damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of  the loans may be used as the non-Federal share of any Federal program,  including those under the Stafford Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Relation to other assistance. Any Special Community Disaster  Loans including cancellations of loans made under this subpart shall not  reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance  provided under the authority of the Stafford Act or this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Cancellation. The Director of the Public Assistance Division  shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster  Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local  government during the three full fiscal years following the disaster are  insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government  because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed  disaster-related municipal operating expenses.  [70 FR 60446, Oct. 18, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 2817, Jan. 19, 2010]</p>
