                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Access: ``Physical'' entry to and/or exit from a facility/area  of a facility (such as a building or room in a building) or ``logical''  entry into an information system, such as a researcher up-loading data/ information through a secure Web site or a contractor accessing an HHS- controlled information system from its own facility. It does not include  access to a public Web site, whether by an HHS contractor or member of  the public, because such Web sites do not require permission to access.  In the case of sensitive data/information that exists in hard copy,  ``access'' means providing a contractor the right to view or use  written/typed data or information for the purpose described in a  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Long-term: Greater than 6 months in duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Routine: On a regular, non-intermittent basis, which is at least  once per week during the contract or order period of performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sensitive data/information: As defined by the Computer Security  Act of 1987, any data/information, ``the loss, misuse, or unauthorized  access to or modification of which, could adversely affect the national  interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which  individuals are entitled under section 552a of the Title 5 of U.S.C.  (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under  criteria established by an Executive order or an act of Congress to be  kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.''  Examples include individuals' social security numbers; other personal  identification information, such as individuals' health, medical, or  psychological information; proprietary research data; and confidential  legal data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Short-term: Six (6) months or less in duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12), entitled,  ``Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and  Contractors,'' was issued on August 27, 2004, to enhance security and  reduce identity fraud related to contractor physical access to  Federally-controlled facilities and/or logical access to Federally- controlled information systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The HSPD-12 requirements related to routine, long-term physical  access to HHS-controlled facilities and logical access to HHS-controlled  information systems, including contractor personnel background checks/ investigations (termed herein as ``more stringent'' access procedures),  apply to all solicitations and new contracts or orders for services,  including services   incidental to supply contracts/orders, regardless of dollar amount,  where the contractor will require such access (FAR 4.1303). In addition,  HHS has determined that, when a contractor has routine, long-term access  to sensitive data/information, whether it exists in an HHS-controlled  information system or in hard copy, that data/information must also be  protected and controlled in accordance with HSPD-12's more stringent  access procedures--see 304.1300(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a contractor's access to HHS-controlled facilities,  information systems, and/or sensitive data/information is of routine but  short-term duration, an OPDIV shall use the applicable guidance cited in  OMB memorandum M-05-24 related to ``short-term'' access to determine  appropriate protections and limit/control contractor access--see  304.1300(f)]. However, if the Project Officer determines greater access  controls are necessary, an OPDIV may protect and control facilities,  information systems, and/or sensitive data information in accordance  with HSPD-12's more stringent access procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a contractor's access to HHS-controlled facilities,  information systems, and/or sensitive data/information is not routine,  regardless of duration, HHS has determined that OPDIVs shall use the  applicable guidance cited in OMB memorandum M-05-24 related to  ``occasional visitors'' to determine appropriate protections and limit/ control contractor access--see 304.1300(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Summary table of contractor access circumstances and HSPD-12  requirements.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">HSPD-12 security</p><p class="depth0">HSPD-12 access    notice required in</p><p class="depth0">Type of access               procedures         solicitation/</p><p class="depth0">required        contract SOW/PWS?</p><p class="depth0">[see 304.1300(e)] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Routine, long-term, physical      More stringent      YES.</p><p class="depth0">access to HHS-controlled          access procedures</p><p class="depth0">facilities.                       apply.

If contractor access is required, the Project  Officer must assess, based on information available at that point in the  process, the type, frequency, and duration of such access. Following  that determination, the Project Officer shall consult with OPDIV and/or  local building and IT security officials/staff, and officials/staff  involved with personnel security, including the designated personnel  security representative, to determine appropriate security requirements  and, as necessary, adjust project requirements to minimize security and  access issues. The Project Officer shall comply with HSPD-12 and the   following implementing guidance in making these judgments and  determinations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> OMB memorandum M-05-24, Implementation of Homeland Security  Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12--Policy for a Common Identification  Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated August 5, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> National Institutes of Standards and Technology Federal  Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS PUB) 201), dated  February 25, 2005, which can be accessed at: http://csrc.nist.gov/ publications/.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FAR (FAR 4.13 and 52.204-9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any HHS and OPDIV implementation thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, as part of the acquisition planning process, the Project  Officer determines that contractor access will not be required, the  Project Officer should so state in the AP (or other acquisition request  document)--see 307.7101. If an AP does not address access issues or  indicates contractor access is not required, and it appears an  acquisition may involve access requirements, the Contracting Officer  shall request that the Project Officer address or reconsider the initial  access determination. The Project Officer's determination shall be  final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If HSPD-12's more stringent access procedures are expected to  apply, because access will be routine and of long-term duration, or is  routine and of short-term duration, but greater access controls are  deemed necessary, the Project Officer shall include the following ``HHS- Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' notice in a  separate, clearly designated ``Security'' section of the SOW/PWS. (Note:  The Contracting Officer is responsible for tailoring the language in the  solicitation and contract/order in accordance with the instructions  provided below.)</p><p class="depth0">``XXX Security.</p><p class="depth0">HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To perform the work specified herein, Contractor personnel are  expected to have routine (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled  facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system;  (3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHS- controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of  circumstances (1) through (3). (b) To gain routine physical access to an  HHS facility, logical access to an HHS-controlled information system,  and/or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its  employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive  (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal  Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget memorandum  (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication  (FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and  investigation procedures contained in the following documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> HHS Information Security Program Policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/ Suitability Handbook, dated February 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Note: Based upon information provided by the Project Officer,  the Contracting Officer shall insert references to OPDIV and/or local  procedural guideline(s), if any; indicate if they are readily accessible  to the public; and, if so, specify where they may be found. If they are  not readily accessible, the Contracting Officer shall attach a copy to  the solicitation and contract and reference the guideline(s) here.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> This contract/order will entail the following position  sensitivity level(s): --------------------.</p><p class="depth0">Note: At the time of solicitation, based upon information provided  by the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer shall specify all known  levels. If the position sensitivity levels are not known at that time,  the Contracting Officer shall insert the words ``To Be Determined at the  Time of Award.'' However, the Contracting Officer must include the  definitive position sensitivity levels in the awarded contract/order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel  require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/ investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The  minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a  National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More  restricted positions--i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more  extensive documentation and investigation.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Contracting Officer shall include the following sentence  in each solicitation as the concluding sentence in paragraph (d)): ``As  part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels  are specified in paragraph (c) above, the Offeror shall notify the  Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to  a background check/investigation and (2) whether any of its proposed  personnel who   will work under the contract have previously been the subject of  national agency checks or background investigations.''</p><p class="depth0">(The Contracting Officer shall include the following sentence in  each contract/order as the concluding sentence in paragraph (d) in lieu  of the solicitation language: ``The Contractor shall notify the  Contracting Officer in advance when any new personnel, who are subject  to a background check/investigation, will work under the contract and if  they have previously been the subject of national agency checks or  background investigations.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Investigations are expensive and may delay performance,  regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with  rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in  accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Contracting Officer shall include the following sentence  in each solicitation as the concluding sentence in paragraph (e):  ``Accordingly, if position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph  (c), the Offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work  under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval.'' The  Contracting Officer shall include the following sentence in each  contract/order as the concluding sentence in paragraph (e) in lieu of  the solicitation language: ``Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure  that any additional employees whose names it submits for work under this  contract have a reasonable chance for approval.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to  the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position  may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in  the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional  investigation(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Contractor shall include language similar to this ``HHS- Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' language in all  subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same  frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled  facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system;  (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS- controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of  circumstances (1) through (3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for  forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within 7 calendar days after the Government's final acceptance  of the work under this contract, or upon termination of the contract,  the Contractor shall return all identification badges to the Contracting  Officer or designee.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> When a contractor's access to HHS-controlled facilities,  information systems, and/or sensitive data/information is of routine,  but short-term duration, and greater access controls are not deemed  necessary, the Contracting Officer and Project Officer shall use the  applicable guidance cited in OMB memorandum M-05-24, dated August 5,  2005, specifically Attachment A, ``HSPD-12 Implementation Guidance for  Federal Departments and Agencies,'' to ensure that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adequate OPDIV access controls are applied, and a contractor is  granted only limited/controlled access to facilities, systems, and/or  sensitive data/information, consistent with the requirements of the  acquisition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contractor staff are provided with clear OPDIV documentation on  the rules of behavior and consequences of their violation before being  granted access to facilities, systems, and/or sensitive data/ information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contractor security violations are documented and reported to  the appropriate OPDIV authority within 24 hours of their occurrence; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identity credentials issued to contractor staff are visually and  electronically distinguishable from credentials issued to individuals to  whom the more stringent HSPD-12 access procedures apply.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0">However, as indicated in 304.1300(e), if the Project Officer  determines greater access controls are necessary, an OPDIV may protect  and control facilities, information systems, and/or sensitive data  information in accordance with HSPD-12's more stringent access  procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> When a contractor's access to HHS-controlled facilities,  information systems, and/or sensitive data/information is not routine,  regardless of duration, the Contracting Officer and Project Officer  shall use the applicable guidance cited in OMB memorandum M-05-24, dated  August 5, 2005, specifically Attachment A, ``HSPD-12 Implementation  Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies,'' related to ``occasional  visitors'' to determine appropriate protections and limit/control  contractor access to ensure that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adequate OPDIV access controls are applied, and the contractor  is granted only limited/controlled access   to facilities, systems, and/or sensitive data/information, consistent  with the requirements of the acquisition; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> OPDIV visitor policies, including contractor personnel identity  badging requirements, are enforced and are provided to the contractor.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 304.70_Acquisition Instrument Identification Numbering System</p>
