                                Sec. 418.2110  What is the effective date of our initial determination

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally, an income-related monthly adjustment amount  determination will be effective for all months that you are enrolled in  a prescription drug coverage plan during the year for which we determine  you must pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When we have used modified adjusted gross income information  from the IRS for the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year to  determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, and modified  adjusted gross income information for the tax year 2 years prior later  becomes available from the IRS, we will review the new information to  determine if we should revise our initial determination concerning the  income-related monthly adjustment amount. If we revise our initial  determination, the effective date of the new initial determination will  be January 1 of the effective year, or the first month your enrollment  or re-enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became  effective if later than January.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When we use your amended tax return, as described in  Sec. 418.2150, the effective date will be January 1 of the year(s) that  is affected, or the first month in that year that your enrollment or re- enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became  effective if later than January.</p><p class="depth2">Example: You are enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage  throughout 2011. We use your 2009 modified adjusted gross income as  reported to us by the IRS to determine your 2011 income-related monthly  adjustment amount. In 2012, you submit to us a copy of your 2009 amended  tax return that you filed with the IRS. The modified adjusted gross  income reported on your 2009 amended tax return is significantly less  than originally reported to the IRS. We use the modified adjusted gross  income reported on your 2009 amended tax return to determine your  income-related monthly adjustment amount. That income-related monthly  adjustment amount is effective January 1, 2011. We will retroactively  correct any differences between the amount paid in 2011 and the amount  you should have paid based on the amended tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When we use evidence that you provide to proves the IRS modified  adjusted gross income information we used was incorrect, as described in  Sec. 418.2335, the effective date will be January of the year(s) that is  affected or the first month in that year that your enrollment or re- enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became  effective if later than January.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When we use information from a more recent tax year that you  provide due to a major life-changing event, as described in  Sec. 418.2201, the effective date is described in Sec. 418.2230.</p>
