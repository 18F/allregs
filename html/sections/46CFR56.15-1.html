                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pipe joining fittings certified in accordance with subpart 50.25 of this subchapter are acceptable for use in piping systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Threaded, flanged, socket-welding, buttwelding, and socket-brazing pipe joining fittings, made in accordance with the applicable standards in tables 56.60-1(a) and 56.60-1(b) of this part and of materials complying with subpart 56.60 of this part, may be used in piping systems within the material, size, pressure, and temperature limitations of those standards and within any further limitations specified in this subchapter. Fittings must be designed for the maximum pressure to which they may be subjected, but in no case less than 50 pounds per square inch gage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pipe joining fittings not accepted for use in piping systems in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must meet the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All pressure-containing materials must be accepted in accordance with Sec. 56.60-1 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fittings must be designed so that the maximum allowable working pressure does not exceed one-fourth of the burst pressure or produce a primary stress greater than one-fourth of the ultimate tensile strength of the material for Class II systems and for all Class I, I-L, and II-L systems receiving ship motion dynamic analysis and nondestructive examination. For Class I, I-L, or II-L systems not receiving ship motion dynamic analysis and nondestructive examination under Sec. 56.07-10(c) of this part, the maximum allowable working pressure must not exceed one-fifth of the burst pressure or produce a primary stress greater than one-fifth of the ultimate tensile strength of the material. The maximum allowable working pressure may be determined by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculations comparable to those of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) or section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subjecting a representative model to a proof test or experimental stress analysis described in paragraph A-22 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other means specifically accepted by the Marine Safety Center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fittings must be tested in accordance with Sec. 56.97-5 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If welded, fittings must be welded in accordance with subpart 56.70 of this part and part 57 of this chapter or by other processes specifically approved by the Marine Safety Center. In addition, for fittings to be accepted for use in piping systems in accordance with this paragraph, the following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For fittings sized three inches and below--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The longitudinal joints must be fabricated by either gas or arc welding;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> One fitting of each size from each lot of 100 or fraction thereof must be flattened cold until the opposite walls meet without the weld developing any cracks;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> One fitting of each size from each lot of 100 or fraction thereof must be hydrostatically tested to the pressure required for a seamless drawn pipe of

the same size and thickness produced from equivalent strength material, as determined by the applicable pipe material specification; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If a fitting fails to meet the test in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) or (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section, no fitting in the lot from which the test fitting was chosen is acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For fittings sized above three inches--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The longitudinal joints must be fabricated by arc welding;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For pressures exceeding 150 pounds per square inch, each fitting must be radiographically examined as specified in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For pressures not exceeding 150 pounds per square inch, the first fitting from each size in each lot of 20 or fraction thereof must be examined by radiography to ensure that the welds are of acceptable quality;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> One fitting of each size from each lot of 100 or fraction thereof must be hydrostatically tested to the pressure required for a seamless drawn pipe of the same size and thickness produced from equivalent strength material, as determined by the applicable pipe material specification; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> If a fitting fails to meet the test in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) or (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, no fitting in the lot from which the test fitting was chosen is acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Single welded butt joints without the use of backing strips may be employed in the fabrication of pipe joining fittings of welded construction provided radiographic examination indicates that complete penetration is obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each pipe joining fitting must be marked in accordance with MSS SP-25 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).
