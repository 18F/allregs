Such personnel will be experienced in the proper operation and maintenance of applicable plant components. A report will be presented to the borrower within two weeks of each site visit advising the borrower of operation and maintenance deficiencies. A copy of each report will be forwarded to the State Director and lender by the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The project engineer will prepare or supervise the preparation of a record drawing of all facilities. One copy will be submitted to the lender and the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The project engineer or another group acceptable to the State Director and lender will prepare an operation and maintenance manual and assist the borrower in the start-up of the project. The operation and maintenance manual will describe the specific operation and maintenance procedures which must be performed for the project to operate at its rated capacity and efficiency and outline product testing, quality control, plant safety and emergency shut-down procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The project engineer will assist the borrower in determining acceptability of materials, equipment and construction during the construction period, review shop drawings, payment estimates and change orders, and assist in determining substantial completion of the project and final completion of individual contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The project is substantially complete when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Construction is sufficiently completed in accordance with plans and specifications so that the project may be used for its intended purpose, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The project is producing products of the quantity and quality and at the conversion and energy efficiencies proposed in the completed application submitted by the lender and borrower and approved by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State Director must concur that the project is substantially complete. The following evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the State Director and lender, must be submitted prior to such concurrence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A certificate from the project engineer stating that all facilities are substantially complete. Engineers who design specialized equipment or processes must also certify that construction/fabrication is acceptable in accordance with plans and specifications previously approved by them. The certification of the project engineer must be based upon a project start-up procedure where the complete project operates continuously to reach steady-state operating conditions. During this period contractors and engineers will identify and correct problems in operations, malfunctions in equipment, failure in materials and defects in workmanship. After this pre-startup, the certifying engineers will monitor project operations for a continuous period of at least 72 hours or 3 consecutive batch runs as appropriate to assure that all equipment is operating satisfactorily at rated capacity and efficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Copies of system operation and performance data obtained during project start-up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions to substantial completion and a list of nonsubstantial items which must be completed prior to release of any contractor's retainage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the project is not producing products of the required quantity or quality at the prescribed conversion efficiencies, even though the project is otherwise physically complete in accordance with paragraph (1)(i) of this subparagraph, the project engineer will prepare a report identifying the corrective actions including an estimate of costs and additional time necessary to meet established performance criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The project must be certified to be substantially complete by an independent engineer if any portion of the project has been designed or constructed by the borrower or the project engineer has participated in any portion of the construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Modification of plans and specifications will not be made without the written authorization of the project engineer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Administrator, State Director or their representative's acceptance or concurrence in feasibility studies, preliminary engineering reports, plans, specifications, contract documents and payment estimates will not be construed as a representation of the adequacy of same, reliability of cost estimates or quality of construction, nor will such acceptance or concurrence be deemed a waiver of any of the Government's rights or remedies against any person or party. Reviews and construction inspections by the Administrator, State Director or their representatives are solely for the benefit of the Government and do not relieve the lender or borrower of their obligation to conduct project reviews and inspections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(III)</em> Project Construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Borrower will not award contracts for the construction of any project facilities unless and until:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The borrower obtains applicable construction permits, right-of-ways, licenses

and approvals of Federal, State and local authorities for the construction of such facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State Director concurs in applicable plans, specifications and contract documents. Standard contract documents prescribed for use in Federally assisted projects may be used as a guide for determining the minimum standards for contract acceptability. These standard documents are contained in Guides 18 and 19 of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The borrower has the responsibility, without recourse to the Government, for the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. This includes, but is not limited to, disputes, claims, protests of awards, or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of laws are to be referred to such local, State, or Federal authority as may have proper jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The borrower's attorney will review executed contract documents including applicable performance and payment bonds and provide a certificate to the borrower and lender that they have been properly executed and that the persons executing these documents have been properly authorized to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In all contracts for construction or facility improvement awarded in excess of $100,000, the borrower will require bonds and a bank letter of credit or cash deposit in escrow, assuring performance and payment of 100 percent of the contract cost.

Where the right of use or control of any property or equipment not owned by the borrower is essential to the successful operation of the project during the life of the loan, such right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the owner(s) of the property or equipment and the borrower. Lease agreements shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site or facility, forfeiture or similiar cancellation clauses and shall provide for the right to transfer and lease without restriction. Such lease contracts or agreements shall be approved by the lender and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(IV)</em> Project Control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Lender will adopt project control procedures to assure that loan funds are applied for costs or expenses properly attributable to the project (``Eligible Project Costs'') as proposed in the completed application submitted by the lender and borrower and approved by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. A project monitoring account (``Project Monitoring Account'') will be developed by lender for this purpose and concurred in by the State Director. This account will be divided into sufficient budget categories to permit adequate control of expenditures and identification of potential budget overruns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The first advance (``First Advance'') of loan funds to the borrower will not commence from the Project Monitoring Account prior to lender's receipt of evidence that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The borrower has made adequate provisions for compliance with measures established by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to mitigate adverse historical and environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable engineering, design/build, construction management, inspection and plant start-up service agreements have been obtained and accepted by the State Director and lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The project engineer has prepared a detailed cost estimate and construction schedule for all facilities related to the project. This estimate must indicate that the project

can be completed with the funds available as shown on the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-1, ``Application for Loan and Guarantee.'' A reasonable contingency amount will be included in the estimate. This contingency shall be at least 20 percent of the estimated project costs for which firm bids have not been received plus 5 percent of project costs for which firm bids have been received. Construction interest and inspection costs will be based upon a reasonable contingency for unforeseen delays in project completion. The estimate shall include a listing with associated costs of any proposed leasing arrangements for property or equipment that is essential to the successful operation of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All funds necessary for construction of project facilities will be available when needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The borrower has retained a project manager with sufficient experience and training to supervise project construction and engineering services on behalf of the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> After the first advance, future advances may be made from the Project Monitoring Account, in accordance with prudent lender practice, for all Eligible Project Costs established in the Project Monitoring Account, provided these payments are made in accordance with the terms of applicable contracts and are approved by the borrower and, when applicable, recommended by the project engineer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Payments for Eligible Project Costs incurred by the borrower prior to satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the first advance shall be made with borrower's funds or other nonguaranteed loan funds only. These payments however, may be reimbursed through the Project Monitoring Account as authorized by the State Director after compliance with Paragraph (IV)(B) hereof. The lender will not advance and the borrower will not be entitled to loan funds for reimbursement if such costs or expenses incurred by the borrower prior to the first advance, or at anytime thereafter, were for costs or expenses other than Eligible Project Costs. Costs and expenses accruing from but not limited to, interest charges imposed by construction, equipment, material or service contracts, penalty payments, damage claims, awards or settlements are not Eligible Project Costs unless specifically approved by the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The lender will monitor the progress of construction and undertake the reviews and project inspections necessary to reasonably assure that funds are paid for Eligible Project Costs and that problems in project development are expeditiously reported to the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The lender will prepare a monthly report showing the expenditures made from each budget category of the Project Monitoring Account. This report will include a review of construction progress including proposed and approved contract change orders and, to the extend possible, identify problems or delays in construction or other matters which might affect successful startup of project. This report may be based upon information received from the project engineer and borrower and/or independent observations of the lender. The report will be initialed by the borrower and project engineer and submitted to the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Transfer of loan funds between established or new categories of the Project Monitoring Account or any change in the total amount of funds committed to the project will be reported by the lender to the State Director as these changes occur.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix E to Subpart E of Part 1980--Environmental Assessment</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">In completing an assessment, it is important to understand the comprehensive nature of the impacts which must be analyzed. Consideration must be given to all potential impacts associated with the construction of the project and its operation and maintenance. The attainment of the project's major objectives often induces or supports changes in population densities, land uses, community services, transportation systems and resource consumption. The impacts of these activities must also be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">The environmental reviewer should consult with appropriate experts from Federal, State and local agencies, universities and other organizations or groups whose views could be helpful in the assessment of potential impacts. In so doing, each discussion which is utilized in reaching a conclusion with respect to the degree of an impact should be summarized in the assessment as accurately as possible and include name, title, phone number, and organization of the individual contacted, plus the date of contact. Related correspondence should be attached to the assessment.</p><p class="depth0">The Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assessment should be prepared in the following format; it should address the listed items and questions and contain as attachments the indicated descriptive materials, as well as the environmental information submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">These assessment guidelines have been designed to cover the wide variety of impacts which may be encountered. Consequently, not every issue or potential impact raised in these guildlines may be relevant to each project. The purpose of the format is to give the preparer an understanding of a standard range of impacts, environmental factors and

issues which may be encountered. In preparing an assessment, each topic heading identified by a roman numeral and each environmental factor listed under topic heading IV, such as air quality for example, must be addressed.</p><p class="depth0">The amount of analysis and material that must be provided will depend upon the type and size of the project, the environment in which it is located and the range and complexity of the potential impacts. The amount of analysis and detail provided, therefore, must be commensurate with the magnitude of the expected impact. The analysis of each environmental factor (i.e., water quality) must be taken to the point that a conclusion can be reached and supported concerning the degree of the expected impact with respect to that factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Project description and need. Identify the name, project number, location, and specific elements of the project along with their sizes, and, when applicable, their design capacities. Indicate the purpose of the project, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's position regarding the need for it, and the extent or area of land to be considered as the project site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(II)</em> Primary beneficiaries and related activities.</p><p class="depth0">Identify any existing businesses or major developments that will benefit from the project and those which will expand or locate in the area because of the project. Specify by name, product, service, and operations involved.</p><p class="depth0">Identify any related activities which are defined as interdependent parts of an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action. Such undertakings are considered interdependent parts whenever they either make possible or support the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action or are themselves induced or supported by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action or another related activity. These activities may have been completed in the very recent past and are now operational or they may reasonably be expected to be accomplished in the near future. Related activities may or may not be Federally permitted or assisted. When they are, identify the involved Federal agency(s).</p><p class="depth0">In completing the remainder of the assessment, it must be remembered that the impacts to be addressed are those which stem from the project, the primary beneficiaries, and the related activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(III)</em> Description of project area. Describe the project site and its present use. Describe the surrounding land uses; indicate the directions and distances involved. The extent of the surrounding land to be considered depends on the extent of the impacts of the project, its related activities, and the primary beneficiaries. Unique or sensitive areas must be pointed out. These include residential, schools, hospitals, recreational, historical sites, beaches, lakes, rivers, parks, floodplains, wetlands, dunes, estuaries, barrier islands, natural landmarks, unstable soils, steep slopes, aquifer recharge areas, important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangelands, endangered species habitats, or other delicate or rare ecosystems.</p><p class="depth0">Attach adequate location maps of the project area, as well as (1) a U.S. Geological Survey ``15 minute'' (``7\1/2\ minute'' if available) topographic map which clearly delineates the area and the location of the project elements, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development's floodplain map(s) for the project area, (3) site photos, (4) if completed, a standard soil survey for the project and, (5) if available, an aerial photograph of the site. When necessary for descriptive purposes or environmental analysis, include land use maps or other graphic information. All graphic materials shall be of high quality resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(IV)</em> Environmental impact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Air Quality--Discuss, in terms of the amounts and types of emissions to be produced, all aspects of the project including beneficiaries' operations and known indirect effects (such as increased motor vehicle traffic) which will affect air quality. Indicate the existing air quality in the area. Indicate if topographical or meteorological conditions hinder or affect the dispersals of air emissions.

Appendix I to Subpart E of Part 1980--Instructions for Loan</p><p class="depth0">Guarantees for Drought and Disaster Relief</p><p class="depth0">A. In general. Drought and Disaster (D&D;) guaranteed loans are authorized by section 331 (``Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises'') of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, which provides for guarantees of up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal amount of qualifying loans. Interest and protective advances are not covered by the guarantee. Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans may be either to assist in alleviating financial

distress caused to rural business entities, directly or indirectly, by drought, hail, excessive moisture, or related conditions occurring in 1988, or to assist such entities that refinance or restructure debt as a result of losses incurred, directly or indirectly, because of such natural disasters. Where used in this appendix, the term ``natural disaster(s)'' refers only to drought, hail, excessive moisture, and related conditions occurring in 1988. All provisions of Subparts A and E of Part 1980 of this chapter apply to D&D; loans, except as provided in this appendix. All forms used in connection with a D&D; loan will be those used in connection with a B&I; guaranteed loan, except for the following three forms that are incorporated in this Appendix I of this Subpart E, made a part hereof, and appear in the Federal Register following the body of this appendix as Exhibits A, B, and C in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-68, ``Lender's Agreement--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans,'' will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-35, ``Lender's Agreement.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-69, ``Loan Note Guarantee--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans,'' will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-34, ``Loan Note Guarantee.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-70, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans,'' will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-36, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement.''</p><p class="depth0">B.

Sec. 1980.411(a)(11), 1980.412, and section C., below, loan procees may be used for purposes described in Sec. 1980.411(a) if such use of loan proceeds will assist in alleviating financial distress caused, directly or indirectly, by drought, hail, excessive moisture, or related conditions which occurred in 1988. In lieu of the debt refinancing requirements in Sec. 1980.411(a)(11), the following refinancing requirements apply to D&D; loans. Loan proceeds to be used for refinancing must be used solely for refinancing or restructuring of debts as a result of losses incurred, directly or indirectly, as a result of drought, hail, excessive moisture, or related condition occurring in 1988, and such refinancing or restructuring of debt(s) must be essential for the borrower to meet its financial obligations in a timely fashion.

The terms of the Loan Note Guarantee are controlling. In order to facilitate the marketability of the guaranteed portion of the loan and as a condition for obtaining a guarantee of the loan(s), the Lender enters into this agreement. The maximum loss guaranteed is governed by 7 CFR Part 1980 Subpart E Appendix I and the Loan Note Guarantee (Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans)</p><p class="depth0">The Parties Agree:</p><p class="depth0">I. The maximum loss covered under the Loan Note Guarantee will not exceed ------ percent of the principal (Maximum $------).</p><p class="depth0">II. Full Faith and Credit. The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the Lender has actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or which Lender participates in or condones. Any note which provides for the payment of interest on interest shall not be guaranteed. Any Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan (Assignment Guarantee Agreement) attached to or relating to a note which provides for payment of interest on interest is void.</p><p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee will be unenforceable by the Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses will be unenforceable by the Lender to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by FmHA or its successor

agency under Public Law 103-354 in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent Lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of failure to act but also not acting in a timely manner or acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.</p><p class="depth0">III. Lender's Sale or Assignment of Guaranteed Loan. A. The Lender may retain all of the guaranteed loan. The Lender is not permitted to sell or participate any amount of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion(s) of the loan(s) to the applicant or Borrower or members of their immediate families, their officers, directors, stockholders, other owners, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate. If the Lender desires to market all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan at or subsequent to loan closing, such loan must not be in default as set forth in the terms of the notes. The Lender may proceed under the following options:</p><p class="depth0">1. Assignment. Assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more Holders by using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-70, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan.''

Upon such notification the assignee shall succeed to all rights and obligations of the Holder(s) therunder. If this portion is selected, the Lender may not at a later date cause to be issued any additional notes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multi-Note System. When this option is selected by the Lender, upon disposition the Holder will receive one of the Borrower's executed notes and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-69, ``Loan Note Guarantee--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan'' attached to the Borrower's note.

The amount required to be retained must be of the unguaranteed portion of the loan and cannot be participated to another. The Lender may sell the remaining amount of the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. However, the Lender will always retain the responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">B. When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold by the Lender to a Holder(s), the Holder(s) shall thereupon succeed to all rights of Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan to the extent of the portion of loan purchased. Lender will remain bound to all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan, and this agreement, and the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program regulations found in the applicable Subpart of Title 7 CFR Part 1980, and to future FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program regulations not

The Lender will service the entire loan and will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record, not withstanding the fact that another may hold a portion of the loan.

The unguaranteed portion of a loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">B. Disposition of the guaranteed portion of a loan may be made prior to full disbursement, completion of construction and acquisitions only with the prior written approval of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Subsequent to full disbursement completion of construction, and acquisition, the guaranteed portion of the loan may be disposed of as provided herein.</p><p class="depth0">It is the Lender's responsibility to see that all construction is properly planned before any work proceeds; that any required permits, licenses or authorizations are obtained from the appropriate regulatory agencies; that the Borrower has obtained contracts through acceptable procurement procedures; that periodic inspections during construction are made and that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's concurrence on the overall development schedule is obtained.</p><p class="depth0">C. Lender's servicing responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Obtaining compliance with the covenants and provisions in the note, loan agreement, security instruments, and any supplemental agreements and notifying in writing FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Borrower of any violations.

Default. A. The Lender will notify FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 when a Borrower is thirty (30) days past due on a payment or if the Borrower has not met its responsibilities of providing the required financial statements to the Lender or is otherwise in default.

The repurchase by the Lender will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of the principal and accrued interest less the Lender's servicing fee. The loan note guarantee will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s). Holder(s) will concurrently send a copy of demand to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the Holder(s) upon repurchase. The Lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting for funds, resolve the problem, and to permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. The Lender will notify the Holder(s) and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of its decision.</p><p class="depth0">D.

FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be subrogated to all rights of Holder(s). The Holder(s) will include in its demand the amount of unpaid principal, due (no capitalized interest).</p><p class="depth0">The Holder will also inform FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of the amount of past interest and capitalized interest it is owed. Such interest is not guaranteed. The Holder(s) remain entitled to all interest due up to the point of repurchase by the Lender or purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from the Holder(s) if such interest is or can be collected. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has purchased, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is equally entitled.</p><p class="depth0">The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office serving the Borrower will promptly notify the Lender of the Holder(s) demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office servicing the Borrower with the information necessary for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's determination of the appropriate amount due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the Holder(s) and the information submitted by the Lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify both parties who must resolve the conflict before payment by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be approved. Such a conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate information, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office servicing the Borrower will review the demand and submit it to the State Director for verification. After reviewing the demand, the State Director will transmit the request to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of the appropriate check. Upon issuance, the Finance Office will notify the office serving the Borrower and State Director and remit the check(s) to the Holder(s).</p><p class="depth0">E. Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and agrees to furnish on request by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by the Borrower on the loan and the amount due to the Holder(s). Lender agrees that any purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's obligations to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 arising from said loan or guarantee, nor does such purchase waive any of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's rights against Lender, and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to set-off against Lender all rights inuring to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from the Holder against FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee. To the extent FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds a portion of a loan, loan subsidy will not be paid the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">F. Servicing fees assessed by the Lender to a Holder are collectible only from payment installments received by the Lender from the Borrower. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 repurchases from a Holder, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will pay the Holder only the amounts due the Holder. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not reimburse the Lender for servicing fees assessed to a Holder and not collected from payments received from the Borrower. No servicing fee shall be charged FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and no such fee is collectible from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">G. Lender may also repurchase the guaranteed portion of the loan consistent with paragraph 10 of the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">XI. Liquidation. If the Lender concludes that liquidation of a guaranteed loan account is necessary because of one or more defaults or third party actions that the Borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time, a meeting will be arranged by the Lender with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 concurs with the Lender's conclusion or at any time concludes independently that liquidation is necessary, it will notify the Lender and the matter will be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0">The Lender will liquidate the loan unless FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, at its option, decides to carry out liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">When the decision to liquidate is made, the Lender may proceed to purchase from Holder(s) the guaranteed portion of the loan. The Holder(s) will be paid according to the provision in the Loan Note Guarantee or the Assignment Guarantee Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">If the Lender does not purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be notified immediately in writing. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will then purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s). If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds any of the guaranteed portion, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be paid first its pro rata share of the proceeds from liquidation of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">A. Lender's proposed method of liquidation. Within 30 days after the decision to liquidate, the Lender will advise FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in writing of its proposed detailed method of liquidation called a liquidation plan and will provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with:</p><p class="depth0">1. Such proof as FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requires to establish the Lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note(s) and related security instruments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information lists concerning the Borrower's assets including real and personal property, fixtures, claims, contracts, inventory (including perishables), accounts receivable, personal and corporate guarantees, and other existing and contingent assets, advice as to whether or not each item is serving as collateral for the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. A proposed method of making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the outstanding loan balance including accrued interest is less than $200,000, the Lender will obtain an estimate of the market and potential liquidated value of the collateral. On loan balances in excess of $200,000, the Lender will obtain an independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the loan, which will reflect the current market value and potential liquidation value. The appraisal report is for the purpose of permitting the Lender and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine the appropriate liquidation actions. Any independent appraiser's fee will be shared equally by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">B. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's response to Lender's liquidation plan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will inform the Lender in writing whether it concurs in the Lender's liquidation plan within 30 days after receipt of such notification from the Lender. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 needs additional time to respond to the liquidation plan, it will advise the Lender of a definite time for such response. Should FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender not agree on the Lender's liquidation plan, negotiations will take place between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender to resolve the disagreement. The Lender will ordinarily conduct the liquidation; however, should FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 opt to conduct the liquidation, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. The Lender will transfer to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 all rights and interests necessary to allow FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to liquidate the loan. In this event, the Lender will not be paid for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">2. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will attempt to obtain the maximum amount of proceeds from liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Options available to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 include any one or combination of the usual commercial methods of liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">C. Acceleration. The Lender or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, if it liquidates, will proceed as expeditiously as possible when acceleration of the indebtedness is necessary including giving any notices and taking any other legal actions required by the security instruments. A copy of the acceleration notice or other acceleration document will be sent to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the Lender, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0">D. Liquidation: Accounting and Reports. When the Lender conducts the liquidation, it will account for funds during the period of liquidation and will provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with periodic reports on the progress of liquidation, disposition of collateral, resulting costs and additional procedures necessary for successful completion of liquidation. The Lender will transmit to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 any payments received from the Borrower and/or pro rata share of liquidation or other proceeds, etc. when FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-43, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.'' When FmHA or its successor agency under Public

Law 103-354 liquidates, the Lender will be provided with similar reports on request.</p><p class="depth0">E. Determination of Loss and Payment. In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the Lender after the collateral is liquidated. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party liable.</p><p class="depth0">1. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may be approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 after the Lender has submitted a liquidation plan approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Payment will be made in accordance with applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">2. When the Lender is conducting the liquidation, and owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request a tentative loss estimate by submitting to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 an estimate of the loss that will occur in connection with liquidation of the loan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will agree to pay an estimated loss settlement to the Lender provided the Lender applies such amount due to the outstanding principal balance owed on the guaranteed debt. Such estimate will be prepared and submitted by the Lender on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, using the basic formula as provided on the report except that the appraisal value will be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">After the Report of Loss estimate has been approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, and within 30 days thereafter, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will send the original Report of Loss estimate to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the estimated amount due the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">After liquidation has been completed, a final loss report will be submitted on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30 by the Lender to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">3. After the Lender has completed liquidation, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, may audit and will determine the actual loss. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has any questions regarding the amounts set forth in the final Report of Loss, it will investigate the matter. The Lender will make its records available to and otherwise assist FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in making the investigation. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finds any discrepancies, it will contact the Lender and arrange for the necessary corrections to be made as soon as possible. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finds the final Report of Loss to be proper in all respects, it will be tentatively approved in the space provided on the form for that purpose.</p><p class="depth0">4. When the Lender has conducted liquidation and after the final Report of Loss has been tentatively approved:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the loss is greater than the estimated loss payment, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will send the original of the final Report of Loss to the Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the additional amount owed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the loss is less than the estimated loss, the Lender will reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from date of payment.</p><p class="depth0">5. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has conducted liquidation, it will provide an accounting and Report of Loss to the Lender and will pay the Lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">F. Maximum amount of interest loss payment. Interest is not covered by the guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">G. Application of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loss payment. The estimated loss payment shall be applied as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be applied by the Lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. However, such application does not release the Borrower from liability. At time of final loss settlement the Lender will notify the Borrower that the loss payment has been so applied. In all cases a final Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30 prepared and submitted by the Lender must be processed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in order to close out the files at the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office.</p><p class="depth0">H. Income from collateral. Any net rental or other income that has been received by the Lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth0">I. Liquidation costs. Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the liquidation process. These liquidation costs will be submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross proceeds from the disposition of collateral

unless the costs have been previously determined by the Lender (with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the Lender will procure FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the Lender will be allowed. In-house expenses include, but are not limited to, employees' salaries, staff lawyers, travel and overhead.</p><p class="depth0">J. Foreclosure. The parties owning the guaranteed portion and unguaranteed portions of the loan will join to institute foreclosure action or, in lieu of foreclosure, to take a deed of conveyance to such parties. When the conveyance is received and liquidated, net proceeds will be applied to the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth0">K. Payment. Such loss will be paid by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 within 60 days after the review of the accounting of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">XII. Protective Advances. Protective advances will not be covered by the guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">XIII. Additional Loans or Advances. The Lender will not make additional expenditures or new loans without first obtaining the written approval of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 even though such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed.</p><p class="depth0">XIV. Future Recovery. After a loan has been liquidated and a final loss has been paid by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, any future funds which may be recovered by the Lender, will be pro-rated between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be paid such amount recovered in proportion to the percentage it guaranteed for the loan and the Lender will retain such amounts in proportion to the percentage of the unguaranteed portion of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">XV. Transfer and Assumption Cases. Refer to the applicable Subpart of Title 7 of CFR Part 1980.</p><p class="depth0">If a loss should occur upon consummation of a complete transfer and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor-debtor (including personal guarantees) is released from personal liability, the Lender, if it holds the guarantee portion, may file an estimated Report of Loss on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' to recover its pro rata share of the actual loss at that time. In completing Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, the amount of the debt assumed will be entered on line 24 as Net Collateral (Recovery).</p><p class="depth0">XVI. Other Requirements. This agreement is subject to all the requirements of the applicable Subpart of Title 7 CFR Part 1980, and any future amendments of these regulations not inconsistent with this agreement. Interested parties may agree to abide by future FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations not inconsistent with this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">XVII. Execution of Agreements. If this agreement is executed prior to the execution of the Loan Note Guarantee, this agreement does not impose any obligation upon FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with respect to execution of such contract. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in no way warrants that such a contract has been or will be executed.</p><p class="depth0">XVIII. Notices.

Total $---------- 100% $----------</p><p class="depth0">In consideration of the making of the subject loan by the above named Lender, the United States of America, acting through the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of the United States Department of Agriculture (herein called ``FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354''), pursuant to the Disaster Assistance Act (P.L. 100-387, 7 USC ) does hereby agree that in accordance with and subject to the conditions and requirements herein, it will pay to:</p><p class="depth0">The Lender the lesser of 1. or 2. below:</p><p class="depth0">1. Any loss sustained by such Lender on the guaranteed portion including principal indebtedness as evidenced by said note(s) or by assumption agreement(s), or</p><p class="depth0">2. The guaranteed principal advanced to or assumed by the Borrower under said note(s) or assumption agreement(s) (Maximum $ ). No capitalized interest is guaranteed.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of Holder. The Holder is the person or organization other than the Lender who holds all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan with no servicing responsibilities. Holders are prohibited from obtaining any part(s) of the guaranteed portion of the loan with proceeds from any obligation, the interest on which is excludable from income, under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (IRC). When the Lender assigns a part(s) of the guaranteed loan to an assignee, the assignee becomes a Holder only when Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-70, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement--Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans,'' is used.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of Lender. The Lender is the person or organization making and servicing the loan which is guaranteed under the provisions of the applicable subpart of 7 CFR Part 1980. The Lender is also the party requesting a loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">Conditions of Guarantee</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan Servicing. Lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan, and Lender will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record not withstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan. When multiple notes are used to evidence a loan, Lender will structure repayments as provided in the loan agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Priorities. The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.</p><p class="depth0">3. Full Faith and Credit. The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which Lender or any Holder has actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or Holder or which Lender or any Holder participates in or condones. If the note to which this is attached or relates provides for payment of interest on interest, then this Loan Note Guarantee is void. In addition, the Loan Note Guarantee will be unenforceable by Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act but also not acting in a timely manner or acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rights and Liabilities. The guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable by Holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by Lender or any unenforceability of this Loan Note Guarantee by Lender. Nothing contained herein will constitute any waiver by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of any rights it possesses aganinst the Lender. Lender will be liable for and will promptly pay to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 any payment made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to Holder which if such Lender had held the guaranteed portion of the loan, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 would not be required to make.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payments. Lender will receive all payments of principal, or interest, on account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to Holder(s) its pro rata share thereof determined according to its respective interest in the loan, less only Lender's servicing fee.</p><p class="depth0">6. Protective Advances. Protective advances made by Lender will not be guaranteed.</p><p class="depth0">7. Repurchase by Lender. The Lender has the option to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s) within 30 days of written demand by the Holder(s) when: (a) the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on principal or interest

due on the loan or (b) the Lender has failed to remit to the Holder(s) its pro rata share of any payment made by the borrower or any loan subsidy within 30 days of its receipt thereof. The repurchase by the Lender will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the Lender's servicing fee. The Loan Note Guarantee will not cover the note interest on the guaranteed loan(s). Holder(s) will concurrently send a copy of demand to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The Lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting for funds, resolve the problem, and to permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. The Lender will notify the Holder(s) and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of its decision.</p><p class="depth0">8. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Purchase. If Lender does not repurchase as provided by paragraph 7 hereof, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will purchase from Holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion less Lender's servicing fee, within thirty (30) days after written demand to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from Holder. The Loan Note Guarantee will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s). Such demand will include a copy of the written demand made upon the Lender. The Holder(s) or its duly authorized agent will also include evidence of its right to require payment from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan Note Guarantee properly endorsed to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be subrogated to all rights of Holder(s). The Holder(s) will include in its demand the amount of unpaid principal due (no capitalized interest).</p><p class="depth0">The Holder will also inform FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of the amount of past interest and capitalized interest it is owed. Such interest is not guaranteed. The Holder(s) remain entitled to all interest due to the point of repurchase by the Lender or purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from the Holder(s) if such interest is or can be collected. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has purchased, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is equally entitled.</p><p class="depth0">The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will promptly notify the Lender of its receipt of the Holder(s)'s demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with the information necessary for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determination of the appropriate amount due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the Holder(s) and the information submitted by the Lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify both parties who must resolve the conflict before payment of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be approved. Such conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate information, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will review the demand and submit it to the State Director for verification. After reviewing the demand the State Director will transmit the request to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of the appropriate check. Upon issuance, the Finance Office will notify the office servicing the borrower and State Director and remit the check(s) to the Holder(s).</p><p class="depth0">9. Lender's Obligations. Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and agrees to furnish on request by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by Borrowers on the loan and the amount including any loan subsidy then owed by any Holder(s). Lender agrees that any purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's obligations to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 arising from said loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's rights against Lender, and that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to set-off against Lender all rights inuring to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as the Holder of this instrument against FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">10. Repurchase by Lender for Servicing. If, in the opinion of the Lender, repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to adequately service the loan, the Holder will sell the portion of the loan to the Lender for an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest (including any loan subsidy) on such portion less Lender's servicing fee. The Loan Note Guarantee will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loans.</p><p class="depth0">a. The lender will not repurchase from the Holder(s) for arbitrage purposes or other purposes to further its own financial gain.</p><p class="depth0">b. Any repurchase will only be made after the Lender obtains FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written approval.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the Lender does not repurchase the portion from the Holder(s), FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 at its option may purchase such guaranteed portions for servicing purposes.</p><p class="depth0">11. Custody of Unguaranteed Portion. The Lender may retain, or sell the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. Participation, as used in this instrument, means the sale of an interest in the loan wherein the Lender retains the note, collateral securing the note, and all responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">12. When Guarantee Terminates. This Loan Note Guarantee will terminate automatically (a) upon full payment of the guaranteed loan; or (b) upon full payment of any loss obligation hereunder; or (c) upon written notice from the Lender to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that the guarantee will terminate 30 days after the date of notice, provided the Lender holds all of the guaranteed portion and the Loan Note Guarantee(s) are returned to be cancelled by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">13. Settlement. The amount due under this instrument will be determined and paid as provided in the applicable Subpart of Part 1980 of Title 7 CFR in effect on the date of this instrument.</p><p class="depth0">14.

In general</p><p class="depth0">Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises (DARBE) guaranteed loans are authorized by Section 401 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989, which provides for guarantees of up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal and interest amount of qualifying loans, or $2,500,000 whichever is less, to any one borrower. DARBE guaranteed loans may be either to assist in alleviating financial distress caused to rural business entities, directly or indirectly, by drought, freeze, storm, excessive moisture, earthquake, or related conditions occurring in 1988 or 1989, or to assist such entities that refinance or restructure debt as a result of losses incurred, directly or indirectly, because of such natural disasters. Where used in this appendix, the term ``natural disaster(s)'' refers only to drought, freeze, storm, excessive moisture, earthquake, and related conditions occurring in 1988 or 1989. All provisions of subparts A and E of part 1980 of this chapter apply to DARBE loans, except as provided in this appendix. All forms used in connection with a DARBE loan will be those used in connection with a Business and Industrial (B&I;) guaranteed loan, except for the following three forms that are incorporated in this appendix K of this subpart E, made a part hereof, and appear in the Federal Register following the body of this appendix as exhibits A, B, and C in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-71, ``Lender's Agreement--Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprise Guaranteed Loans,'' will be used instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-35, ``Lender's Agreement.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-72, ``Loan Note Guarantee--Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprise Guaranteed Loans,'' will

Borrower equity requirements</p><p class="depth0">See FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1980-E, Sec. 1980.441. In lieu of the borrower equity requirements in Sec. 1980.441, paragraphs (a) and (b), the following applies to DARBE loans. Tangible balance sheet equity must be positive when the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. Equity must be such that, when considered with other credit factors, repayment of the loan and the continued success of the business operation are reasonably assured.

Filing and processing preapplications and applications</p><p class="depth0">See FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1980-E, Sec. 1980.451. All requirements of Sec. 1980.451 remain in effect. In addition to the information required as part of a preapplication under Sec. 1980.451(f), and unless previously submitted as a part of an application under

Sec. 1980.451(i) evidence is required which demonstrates to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's satisfaction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The causal relationship between a 1988 or 1989 natural disaster and the financial distress or loss upon which the preapplication or application is based; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the amount of the loan requested is not greater than the amount necessary for curing the problems caused by the natural disaster. Financial distress or loss shall be determined on the basis of a comparison of financial data for comparable periods of time and need not necessarily be based on data at the year's end. Evidence submitted may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evidence of financial loss or distress (including loss or distress caused by business interruption) resulting from physical damage caused by natural disaster, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evidence that the financial loss and/or distress of the business is the direct or indirect result of loss of sales, business interruption, loss of markets, shortage of raw materials, or decline in patronage or customers caused by a nautral disaster. It must be shown that business operations were damaged as a result of such natural disaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of compliance with Sodbuster and Swampbuster requirements as referenced in paragraph K below.</p><p class="depth0">G. Loan guarantee limit. The total principal amount of DARBE guaranteed loans to any one borrower cannot exceed $10,000,000. The maximum loss covered by Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-72, ``Loan Note Guarantee DARBE,'' issued on any one borrower can never exceed the percentage of guarantee multiplied by the unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan as evidenced by the note(s) or by assumption agreement(s), and protective advances, or $2,500,000, whichever is the lesser amount.</p><p class="depth0">H. Percentage of guarantee. The provisions of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 instruction 1980-E, Sec. 1980.420 will not apply to DARBE. For loans in excess of $2,000,000, the percentage of guarantee will be calculated so that the guaranteed portion of the principal amount of the loan cannot exceed $2,000,000. For loans of $2,000,000 or less the maximum percentage of guarantee will be 90 percent. For example, a loan of $10,000,000 would not exceed a 20 percent guarantee; a $5,000,000 loan would not exceed a 40 percent guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">I. Lender's existing unguaranteed exposure</p><p class="depth0">The provisions of Sec. 1980.452 ADMINISTRATIVE C. 1(d) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">J.

Commitment for Guarantee'' (Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14) to enter into a Loan Note Guarantee with the Lender applicable to such loan to participate in a percentage of any loss on the loan not to exceed ----------% of the amount of the principal advance and any interest (including any loan subsidy) thereon. The terms of the Loan Note Guarantee are controlling. In order to facilitate the marketability of the guaranteed portion of the loan and as a condition for obtaining a guarantee of the loan(s), the Lender enters into this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">The Parties Agree:
I. The maximum loss covered under the Loan Guarantee--DARBE will not exceed -------- percent of the principal and accrued interest including any loan subsidy on the above indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0">The Maximum Loss Payment Under a Loan Guarantee Under the Disaster</p><p class="depth0">Assistance For Rural Business Enterprise Guaranteed Loan Program is</p><p class="depth0">Limited to $2,500,000, or the Percentage of Guarantee Times the Principal, Accrued Interest, and Approved Protective Advances, Whichever</p><p class="depth0">is Less.</p><p class="depth0">II. Full Faith and Credit.</p><p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the Lender has actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or which Lender participates in or condones. Any note which provides for the payment of interest on interest shall not be guaranteed. Any Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE or Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE attached to or relating to a note which provides for payment of interest on interest is void.</p><p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will be unenforceable by the Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses will be unenforceable by the Lender to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent Lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act but also not acting in a timely manner or acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent Lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.

Lender's Sale or Assignment of Guarantee Loan--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Lender may retain all of the guaranteed loan. The Lender is not permitted to sell or participate in any amount of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion(s) of the loan(s) to the applicant or Borrower or members of their immediate families, their officers, directors, stockholders, other owners, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate. If the Lender desires to market all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan at or subsequent to loan closing, such loan must not be in default as set forth in the terms of the notes. The Lender may proceed under the following options:</p><p class="depth0">1. Assignment. Assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more Holders by using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-73, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE.'' Holder(s), upon written notice to Lender and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, may reassign the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan sold thereunder. Upon such notification the assignee shall succeed to all rights and obligations of the Holder(s) thereunder. If this option is selected, the Lender may not at a later date cause to be issued any additional notes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multi-Note System. When this option is selected by the Lender, upon disposition the Holder will receive one of the Borrower's executed notes and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-72, ``Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE,'' attached to the Borrower's note. However, all rights under the security instruments (including personal and/or corporate guarantees) will remain with the Lender and in all cases inure to its and the Government's benefit notwithstanding any contrary provisions of state law.</p><p class="depth0">a. At Loan Closing: Provide for no more than 10 notes, unless the Borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public

Law 103-354 agree otherwise, for the guaranteed portion and one note for the unguaranteed portion. When this option is selected, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will provide the Lender with a Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-72, for each of the notes.</p><p class="depth0">b.

Participations.</p><p class="depth0">a. The Lender may obtain participation in its loan under its normal operating procedures. Participation means a sale of an interest in the loan wherein the Lender retains the note, collateral securing the note, and all responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">b. The Lender is required to hold in its own portfolio or retain a minimum of 5% for Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises loans of the total guaranteed loan(s) amount. The amount required to be retained must be of the unguaranteed portion of the loan and cannot be participated to another. The Lender may sell the remaining amount of the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. However, the Lender will always retain the responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">B. When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold by the Lender to a (Holder(s), the Holder(s) shall thereupon succeed to all rights of Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE to the extent of the portion of the loan purchased. Lender will remain bound to all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE, and this agreement, and the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program regulations found in the applicable subpart of title 7 CFR part 1980, and to future FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program regulations not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof.</p><p class="depth0">C.

The Lender will service the entire loan and will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record, notwithstanding the fact that another may hold a portion of the loan. The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. Lender may charge Holder a servicing fee. The unguaranteed portion of a loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">B. Disposition of the guaranteed portion of a loan may be made prior to full disbursement, completion of construction and acquisitions only with the prior written approval

of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.

The loan note guarantee will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s) accruing after 90 days from the date of original demand letter of the Holder(s) to the Lender requesting the repurchase. Such demand will include a copy of the written demand upon the Lender. Under the Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprise Guaranteed Loan program, the maximum cumulative payment to the holder(s) of the guaranteed portion of the loan is limited to $2,500,000 or the percentage of guarantee multiplied by the principal and accrued interest together with protective advances, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">The Holder(s) or its duly authorized agent will also include evidence of its right to require payment from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Such evidence will consist of either the originals of the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE and note properly endorsed to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be subrogated to all rights of Holder(s). The Holder(s) will include in its demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest (including any loan subsidy) to date of demand and interest subsequently accruing from date of demand to proposed payment date. Unless otherwise agreed to by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, such proposed payment will not be later than 30 days from the date of the demand.</p><p class="depth0">The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office serving the Borrower will promptly notify the Lender of the Holder(s) demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office

servicing the Borrower with the information necessary for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's determination of the appropriate amount due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the Holder(s) and the information submitted by the Lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify both parties who must resolve the conflict before payment by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be approved. Such a conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate information, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office servicing the Borrower will review the demand and submit it to the State Director for verification. After reviewing the demand, the State Director will transmit the request to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of the appropriate check. Upon issuance, the Finance Office will notify the office serving the Borrower and State Director and remit the check(s) to the Holder(s).</p><p class="depth0">E. Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and agrees to furnish on request by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by the Borrower on the loan and the amount due the Holder(s). Lender agrees that any purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's obligations to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 arising from said loan or guarantee, nor does such purchase waive any of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's rights against Lender, and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to set-off against Lender all rights insuring to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from the Holder against FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE. To the extent FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds a portion of a loan, loan subsidy will not be paid the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">F. Servicing fees assessed by the Lender to the Holder are collectible only from payment installments received by the Lender from the Borrower. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 repurchases from a Holder, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will pay the Holder only the amounts due the Holder, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not reimburse the Lender for servicing fees assessed to a Holder and not collected from payments received from the Borrower. No servicing fee shall be charged FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and no such fee is collectible from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">G. Lender may also repurchase the guaranteed portion of the loan consistent with paragraph 10 of the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">XI. Liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">If the Lender concludes that liquidation of a guaranteed loan account is necessary because of one or more defaults or third party actions that the Borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time, a meeting will be arranged by the Lender with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 concurs with the Lender's conclusion or at any time concludes independently that liquidation is necessary, it will notify the Lender and the matter will be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0">The Lender will liquidate the loan unless FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, at its option, decides to carry out liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">When the decision to liquidate is made, the Lender may proceed to purchase from Holder(s) the guaranteed portion of the loan. The Holder(s) will be paid according to the provisions in the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE or the Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">When the decision to liquidate is made, the Lender may proceed to purchase from Holder(s) the guaranteed portion of the loan. The Holder(s) will be paid according to the provisions in the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE or the Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">If the Lender does not purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be notified immediately in writing. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will then purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s). If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds any of the guaranteed portion, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be paid first its pro rata share of the proceeds from liquidation of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">A. Lender's proposed method of liquidation. Within 30 days after the decision to liquidate, the Lender will advise FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in writing of its proposed detailed method of liquidation called a liquidation plan and will provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with:</p><p class="depth0">1. Such proof as FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requires to

establish the Lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note(s) and related security instruments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information lists concerning the Borrower's assets including real and personal property, fixtures, claims, contracts, inventory (including perishables), accounts receivable, personal and corporate guarantees, and other existing and contingent assets, advice as to whether or not each item is serving as collateral for the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. A proposed method of making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the outstanding principal DARBE loan balance including accrued interest is less than $200,000, the Lender will obtain an estimate of the market and potential liquidated value of the collateral. On DARBE loan balances in excess of $200,000, the Lender will obtain an independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the loan, which will reflect the current market value and potential liquidation value. The appraisal report is for the purpose of permitting the Lender and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine the appropriate liquidation actions. Any independent appraiser's fee will be shared equally by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">B. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's response to Lender's liquidation plan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will inform the Lender in writing whether it concurs in the Lender's liquidation plan within 30 days after receipt of such notification from the Lender. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 needs additional time to respond to the liquidation plan, it will advise the Lender of a definite time for such response. Should FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender not agree on the Lender's liquidation plan, negotiations will take place between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender to resolve the disagreement. The Lender will ordinarily conduct the liquidation; however, should FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 opt to conduct the liquidation, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. The Lender will transfer to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 all rights and interest necessary to allow FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to liquidate the loan. In this event, the Lender will not be paid for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">2. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will attempt to obtain the maximum amount of proceeds from liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Options available to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 include any one or combination of the usual commercial methods of liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">C. Acceleration. The Lender or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, if it liquidates, will proceed as expeditiously as possible when acceleration of the indebtedness is necessary including giving any notices and taking any other legal actions required by the security instruments. A copy of the acceleration notice or other acceleration document will be sent to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the Lender, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0">D. Liquidation. Accounting and Reports. When the Lender conducts the liquidation, it will account for funds during the period of liquidation and will provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with periodic reports on the progress of liquidation, disposition of collateral, resulting costs and additional procedures necessary for successful completion of liquidation. The Lender will transmit to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 any payments received from the Borrower and/or pro rata share of liquidation or other proceeds, etc. when FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-43, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.'' When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 liquidates, the Lender will be provided with similar reports on request.</p><p class="depth0">E. Determination of Loss and Payment. In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the Lender after the collateral is liquidated. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party liable.</p><p class="depth0">1. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may be approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 after the Lender has submitted a liquidation plan approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Payments will be made in accordance with applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">2. When the Lender is conducting the liquidation, and owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request a tentative loss estimate by submitting to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 an estimate of loss that will occur in connection with liquidation of the loan.

FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will agree to pay an estimated loss settlement to the Lender provided the lender applies such amount due to the outstanding principal balance owed on the guaranteed debt. Such estimate will be prepared and submitted by the Lender on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, using the basic formula as provided on the report except that the appraisal value will be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral. For Farm Ownership, Soil and Water, and Operating loans only, if it appears the liquidation period will exceed 90 days, the Lender will file an estimated loss claim. Once this claim is approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the Lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan and the loss claim will be promptly processed in accordance with the applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">After the Report of Loss estimate has been approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, and within 30 days thereafter, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will send the original Report of Loss estimate to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the estimated amount due the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">After liquidation has been completed, a final loss report will be submitted on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30 by the Lender to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">3. After the Lender has completed liquidation, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, may audit and will determine the actual loss. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has any questions regarding the amounts set forth in the final Report of Loss, it will investigate the matter. The Lender will make its records available to and otherwise assist FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in making the investigation. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finds any discrepancies, it will contact the Lender and arrange for the necessary corrections to be made as soon as possible. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finds the final Report of Loss to be proper in all respects, it will be tentatively approved in the space provided on the form for that purpose.</p><p class="depth0">4. When the Lender has conducted liquidation and after the final Report of Loss has been tentatively approved:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the loss is greater than the estimated loss payment, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will send the original to the final Report of Loss to the Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the additional amount owed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Lender.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the loss is less than the estimated loss, the Lender will reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from date of payment.</p><p class="depth0">5. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has conducted liquidation, it will provide an accounting and Report of Loss to the Lender and will pay the Lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">6. In those instances where the Lender has made authorized protective advances, it may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as protective advances and interest resulting from such protective advances as provided above, and such payment will be made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 when the final Report of Loss is approved.</p><p class="depth0">F. Maximum amount of interest loss payment. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, the amount payable by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Lender cannot exceed the limits set forth in the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered by the guarantee only to the date FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 accepts this responsibility. Loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the extent of the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE to the date of final settlement when the liquidation is conducted by the Lender provided it proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The balance of allowable accrued interest payable to the Lender, if any, will be calculated on the final Report of Loss form.</p><p class="depth0">G. Application of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loss payment. The estimated loss payment shall be applied as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be applied by the Lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. However, such application does not release the Borrower from liability. In all cases a final Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30 prepared and submitted by the Lender must be processed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in order to close out the files at the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office.</p><p class="depth0">H. Income from collateral. Any net rental or other income that has been received by

the Lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth0">I. Liquidation costs. Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the liquidation process. The liquidation costs will be submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross proceeds from the disposition of collateral unless the costs have been previously determined by the Lender (with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the Lender will procure FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the Lender will be allowed. In-house expenses include, but are not limited to, employee's salaries, staff lawyers, travel and overhead.</p><p class="depth0">J. Foreclosure. The parties owning the guaranteed portion and unguaranteed portions of the loan will join the institute foreclosure action or, in lieu of foreclosure, to take a deed of conveyance to such parties. When the conveyance is received and liquidated, net proceeds will be applied to the guaranteed loan debt.</p><p class="depth0">K. Payment. Such loss will be paid by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 within 60 days after the review of the accounting of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">XII. Protective Advances.</p><p class="depth0">Protective advances must constitute an indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender and be secured by the security instrument(s). FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written authorization is required on all protective advances in excess of $500. Protective advances include, but are not limited to, advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard or flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral, and other expenses necessary to preserve or protect the security. Attorney fees are not a protective advance.</p><p class="depth0">XIII. Additional Loans or Advances.</p><p class="depth0">The Lender will not make additional expenditures or new loans without first obtaining the written approval of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 even though such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed.</p><p class="depth0">XIV. Future Recovery.</p><p class="depth0">After a loan has been liquidated and a final loss has been paid by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, any future funds which may be recovered by the Lender, will be pro-rated between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the Lender. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be paid such amount recovered in proportion to the percentage it guaranteed for the loan and the Lender will retain such amounts in proportion to the percentage of the unguaranteed portion of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">XV. Transfer and Assumption Cases.</p><p class="depth0">Refer to the applicable subpart of title 7 of CFR part 1980.</p><p class="depth0">If a loss should occur upon consummation of a complete transfer and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor-debtor (including personal guarantees) is released from personal liability, the Lender, if it holds the guaranteed portion, may file an estimated Report of Loss on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' to recover its pro rata share of the actual loss at that time. In completing Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, the amount of the debt assumed will be entered on line 24 as Net Collateral (Recovery). Approved protective advances and accrued interest thereon made during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption, if not assumed by the Transfer, will be entered on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, line 13 and 14.</p><p class="depth0">XVI. Bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan debt and all collateral securing the loan in bankruptcy proceedings. When the loan is involved in a reorganization bankruptcy proceeding under chapters 11, 12 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, payment of loss claims may be made as provided in this paragraph XVI. For a chapter 7 bankruptcy or liquidation plan in a chapter 11 bankruptcy, only paragraphs XVI B3 and B6 are applicable.</p><p class="depth0">B. Loss Payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated Loss Payments.</p><p class="depth0">a. If a borrower has filed for protection under a reorganization bankruptcy, the Lender will request a tentative estimated loss payment of accrued interest and principal written off. This request can only be made after the bankruptcy plan is confirmed by the court. Only one estimated loss payment is allowed during the reorganization bankruptcy. All subsequent claims during reorganization will be considered revisions to the initial estimated loss. A revised estimated loss payment may be processed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, at its option, in accordance with any court approved changes in the reorganization plan. At the time the performance under the confirmed reorganization plan has been completed, the Lender is responsible for providing FmHA or its successor agency

under Public Law 103-354 with the documentation necessary to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to (a) reflect the actual principal and interest reduction on any part of the guaranteed debt determined to be unsecured and (b) to reimburse the Lender for any court ordered interest rate reduction during the term of the reorganization plan.</p><p class="depth0">b. The Lender will use Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' to request an estimated loss payment and to review estimated loss payments during the course of the reorganization plan. The estimated loss claim as well as any revisions to this claim will be accompanied by applicable legal documentation to support the claim.</p><p class="depth0">c. Upon completion of the reorganization plan, the Lender will complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-44, ``Guaranteed Loan Borrower Default Status,'' and forward this form to the Finance Office.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest Loss Payments.</p><p class="depth0">a. Interest loss payments sustained during the period of the reorganization plan will be processed in accordance with paragraph XVI B1.</p><p class="depth0">b. Interest loss payments sustained after the reorganization plan is completed will be processed annually when the Lender sustains a loss as a result of a permanent interest rate reduction which extends beyond the period of the reorganization plan.</p><p class="depth0">c. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30 will be completed to compensate the Lender for the difference in interest rates specified on the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE or Interest Rate Buydown Agreement and the rate of interest specified by the bankruptcy court.</p><p class="depth0">3. Final Loss Payments.</p><p class="depth0">a. Final Loss Payments will be processed when the loan is liquidated.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the loan is paid in full without an additional loss, the Finance Office will close out the estimated loss account at the time notification of payment in full is received.</p><p class="depth0">4. Payment Application. The Lender must apply estimated loss payments first to the unsecured principal of the guaranteed portion of the debt and then to the unsecured interest of the guaranteed portion of the debt. In the event the bankruptcy court attempts to direct the payments to be applied in a different manner, the Lender will immediately notify the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 servicing office.</p><p class="depth0">5. Overpayments. Upon completion of the reorganization plan, the Lender will provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with the documentation necessary to determine whether the estimated loss paid equals the actual loss sustained. If the actual loss sustained, as a result of the reorganization, is greater than the estimated loss payment, the Lender will submit a revised estimated loss in order to obtain payment of the additional amount owed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Lender. If the actual loss payment is less than the estimated loss, the Lender will reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of the payment of the estimated loss.</p><p class="depth0">6. Protective Advances. If approved protective advances were made prior to the borrower having filed bankruptcy, as a result of prior liquidation action, these protective advances and accrued interest will be entered on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-30.</p><p class="depth0">XVII. Other Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">This agreement is subject to all the requirements of the applicable subpart of title 7 CFR part 1980, and any future amendments of these regulations not inconsistent with this agreement. Interested parties may agree to abide by future FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations not inconsistent with this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">XVIII. Execution of Agreements.</p><p class="depth0">If this agreement is executed prior to the execution of the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE, this agreement does not impose any obligation upon FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with respect to the execution of such contract. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in no way warrants that such a contract has been or will be executed.</p><p class="depth0">XIX.

On loans with multiple Holders and/or a Lender who owns part of the guaranteed portion, if the aggregate losses exceed $2,500,000, each Holder's loss will be prorated by the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan the holder owns.</p><p class="depth0">B. The Lender the lesser of 1, or 2 below:</p><p class="depth0">1. Any loss sustained by the Lender on the guaranteed portion including:</p><p class="depth0">a. Principal and interest indebtedness as evidenced by said note(s) or by assumption agreement(s), and</p><p class="depth0">b. Principal and interest indebtedness on secured protective advances for protection and preservation of collateral made with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's authorization, including but not limited to advances for taxes, annual assessments, any ground rents, and hazard or

flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral, but only to the extent that inclusion of such protective advances would not cause the total aggregate loss to exceed $2,500,000, or</p><p class="depth0">2. The guaranteed principal advanced to or assumed by the Borrower under said note(s) or assumption agreement(s) and any interest due thereon.
But only up to a maximum aggregate amount of $2,500,000. On loans with single or multiple holders and a Lender who owns part of the guaranteed portion, if the aggregate losses exceed $2,500,000, the Lender's loss will be prorated by the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan the Lender owns.
If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 conducts the liquidation of the loan, loss occasioned to a Lender by accruing interest (including any loan subsidy) after the date FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 accepts responsibility for liquidation will not be covered by this Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE. If Lender conducts the liquidation of the loan, accruing interest (including any loan subsidy) shall be covered by this Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE to date of final settlement when the Lender conducts the liquidation expeditiously in accordance with the liquidation plan approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of Holder.</p><p class="depth0">The Holder is the person or organization other than the Lender who holds all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan with no servicing responsibilities. Holders are prohibited from obtaining any part(s) of the guaranteed portion of the loan with proceeds from any obligation, the interest on which is excludable from income, under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (IRC). When the Lender assigns a part(s) of the guaranteed loan to an assignee, the assignee becomes a Holder only when Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-73, ``Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE,'' is used. Loan evidenced by a single note may be assigned only by using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-73.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of Lender.</p><p class="depth0">The Lender is the person or organization making and servicing the loan which is guaranteed under the provisions of the applicable subpart 7 CFR part 1980. The Lender is also the party requesting a loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan Servicing.</p><p class="depth0">Lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan, and the Lender will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record not withstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan. When multiple notes are used to evidence a loan, Lender will structure repayments as provided in the loan agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Priorities.</p><p class="depth0">The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.</p><p class="depth0">3. Full Faith and Credit.</p><p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which Lender or any Holder has actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or Holder or which Lender or any Holder participates in or condones. If the note to which this is attached or relates provides for payment of interest on interest, then this Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE is void. In addition, the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will be unenforceable by Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act but also not acting in a timely manner or acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rights and Liabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable by Holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by Lender or any unenforceability of this Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE by Lender. Nothing contained herein will constitute any waiver by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of any rights it possesses against the Lender. Lender will be liable for and will promptly pay to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 any payment made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to Holder

which if such Lender had held the guaranteed portion of the loan, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 would not be required to make.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payments.</p><p class="depth0">Lender will receive all payments of principal, or interest, and will promptly remit to Holder(s) its pro rata share thereof determined according to its respective interest in the loan, less only Lender's servicing fee.</p><p class="depth0">6. Protective Advances.</p><p class="depth0">Protective advances made by Lender pursuant to the regulations will be guaranteed against a percentage of loss to the extent provided in this Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE notwithstanding the guaranteed portion of the loan that is held by another.</p><p class="depth0">7. Repurchase by Lender.</p><p class="depth0">The Lender has the option to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s) within 30 days of written demand by the Holder(s) when: (a) the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on principal or interest due on the loan or (b) the Lender has failed to remit to the Holder(s) its pro rata share of any payment made by the borrower or any loan subsidy within 30 days of its receipt thereof. The repurchase by the Lender will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the Lender's servicing fee. The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s) accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the Lender requesting the repurchase. Holder(s) will concurrently send a copy of demand to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The Lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the Holder(s) upon repurchase. The Lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting for funds, resolve the problem, and to permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. The Lender will notify the Holder(s) and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of its decision. As per the terms of this guarantee the maximum loss payment will not exceed $2,500,000 for principal, interest, and approved protective advances.</p><p class="depth0">8. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Purchase.</p><p class="depth0">If Lender does not repurchase as provided by paragraph 7 hereof, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will purchase from Holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of repurchase less Lender's servicing fee, within thirty (30) days after written demand to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from Holder. The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s) accruing after 90 days from the date of the original demand letter of the Holder to the Lender requesting the repurchase. Such demand will include a copy of the written demand made upon the Lender. The Holder(s) or its duly authorized agent will also include evidence of its right to require payment from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE properly endorsed to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement--DARBE properly assigned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be subrogated to all rights of Holder(s). The Holder(s) will include in its demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand and interest subsequently accruing from date of demand to proposed payment date or $2,500,000, whichever is less. Unless otherwise agreed to by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, such proposed payment will not be later than 30 days from the date of demand. On loans with multiple Holders and/or a Lender who owns part of the guaranteed portion, if the aggregate unpaid principal and unpaid interest on the guaranteed portion exceeds $2,500,000, the Holder will be paid on a prorated basis--prorated by the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan the Holder owns.</p><p class="depth0">The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will promptly notify the Lender of its receipt of the Holder(s)'s demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with the information necessary for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determination of the appropriate amount due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the Holder(s) and the information submitted by the Lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify both parties who must resolve the conflict before payment by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be approved. Such conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate information, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will review the demand and submit it to the State Director for verification. After reviewing the demand the State Director will transmit the request to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office for issuance of the appropriate check. Upon

issuance, the Finance Office will notify the office servicing the borrower and State Director and remit the check(s) to the Holder(s).</p><p class="depth0">9. Lender's obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and agrees to furnish on request by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by Borrowers on the loan and the amount including any loan subsidy then owed to any Holder(s). Lender agrees that any purchase by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's obligations to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 arising from said loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's rights against Lender, and that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have the right to set-off against Lender all rights inuring to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as the Holder of this instrument against FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE.</p><p class="depth0">10. Repurchase by Lender for Servicing.</p><p class="depth0">If, in the opinion of the Lender, repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to adequately service the loan, the Holder will sell the portion of the loan to the Lender for an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest on such portion. The Lender's servicing fee will be subtracted from these amounts. The Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loans accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter of the Lender or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the Holder(s) requesting the Holder(s) to tender their guaranteed portion(s).</p><p class="depth0">a. The Lender will not repurchase from the Holder(s) for arbitrage purposes or other purposes to further its own financial gain.</p><p class="depth0">b. Any repurchase will only be made after the Lender obtains FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written approval.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the Lender does not repurchase the portion from the Holder(s), FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 at its option may purchase such guaranteed portions for servicing purposes.</p><p class="depth0">11. Custody of Unguaranteed Portion.</p><p class="depth0">The Lender may retain, or sell the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. Participation, as used in this instrument, means the sale of an interest in the loan wherein the Lender retains the note, collateral securing the note, and all responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0">12. When Guarantee Terminates.</p><p class="depth0">This Loan Note Guarantee--DARBE will terminate automatically (a) upon full payment of the guaranteed loan; or (b) upon full payment of any loss obligation hereunder; or (c) upon written notice from the Lender to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that the guarantee will terminate 30 days after the date of notice, provided the Lender holds all of the guaranteed portion and the Loan Note Guarantee(s) are returned to be cancelled by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0">13.

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
INQUIRIES</p><p class="depth0">For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.</p><p class="depth0">For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202-741-6000 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mail fedreg.info@nara.gov.
