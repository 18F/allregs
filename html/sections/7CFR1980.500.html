The estimate shall include a listing with associated costs of any proposed leasing arrangements for property or equipment that is essential to the successful operation of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All funds necessary for construction of project facilities will be available when needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The borrower has retained a project manager with sufficient experience and training to supervise project construction and engineering services on behalf of the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> After the first advance, future advances may be made from the Project Monitoring Account, in accordance with prudent lender practice, for all Eligible Project Costs established in the Project Monitoring Account, provided these payments are made in accordance with the terms of applicable contracts and are approved by the borrower and, when applicable, recommended by the project engineer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Payments for Eligible Project Costs incurred by the borrower prior to satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the first advance shall be made with borrower's funds or other nonguaranteed loan funds only. These payments however, may be reimbursed through the Project Monitoring Account as authorized by the State Director after compliance with Paragraph (IV)(B) hereof. The lender will not advance and the borrower will not be entitled to loan funds for reimbursement if such costs or expenses incurred by the borrower prior to the first advance, or at anytime thereafter, were for costs or expenses other than Eligible Project Costs. Costs and expenses accruing from but not limited to, interest charges imposed by construction, equipment, material or service contracts, penalty payments, damage claims, awards or settlements are not Eligible Project Costs unless specifically approved by the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The lender will monitor the progress of construction and undertake the reviews and project inspections necessary to reasonably assure that funds are paid for Eligible

Project Costs and that problems in project development are expeditiously reported to the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The lender will prepare a monthly report showing the expenditures made from each budget category of the Project Monitoring Account. This report will include a review of construction progress including proposed and approved contract change orders and, to the extend possible, identify problems or delays in construction or other matters which might affect successful startup of project. This report may be based upon information received from the project engineer and borrower and/or independent observations of the lender. The report will be initialed by the borrower and project engineer and submitted to the State Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Transfer of loan funds between established or new categories of the Project Monitoring Account or any change in the total amount of funds committed to the project will be reported by the lender to the State Director as these changes occur.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix E to Subpart E of Part 1980--Environmental Assessment</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">In completing an assessment, it is important to understand the comprehensive nature of the impacts which must be analyzed. Consideration must be given to all potential impacts associated with the construction of the project and its operation and maintenance. The attainment of the project's major objectives often induces or supports changes in population densities, land uses, community services, transportation systems and resource consumption. The impacts of these activities must also be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">The environmental reviewer should consult with appropriate experts from Federal, State and local agencies, universities and other organizations or groups whose views could be helpful in the assessment of potential impacts. In so doing, each discussion which is utilized in reaching a conclusion with respect to the degree of an impact should be summarized in the assessment as accurately as possible and include name, title, phone number, and organization of the individual contacted, plus the date of contact. Related correspondence should be attached to the assessment.</p><p class="depth0">The Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assessment should be prepared in the following format; it should address the listed items and questions and contain as attachments the indicated descriptive materials, as well as the environmental information submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">These assessment guidelines have been designed to cover the wide variety of impacts which may be encountered. Consequently, not every issue or potential impact raised in these guildlines may be relevant to each project. The purpose of the format is to give the preparer an understanding of a standard range of impacts, environmental factors and issues which may be encountered. In preparing an assessment, each topic heading identified by a roman numeral and each environmental factor listed under topic heading IV, such as air quality for example, must be addressed.</p><p class="depth0">The amount of analysis and material that must be provided will depend upon the type and size of the project, the environment in which it is located and the range and complexity of the potential impacts. The amount of analysis and detail provided, therefore, must be commensurate with the magnitude of the expected impact. The analysis of each environmental factor (i.e., water quality) must be taken to the point that a conclusion can be reached and supported concerning the degree of the expected impact with respect to that factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Project description and need. Identify the name, project number, location, and specific elements of the project along with their sizes, and, when applicable, their design capacities. Indicate the purpose of the project, Rural Development's position regarding the need for it, and the extent or area of land to be considered as the project site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(II)</em> Primary beneficiaries and related activities. Identify any existing businesses or major developments that will benefit from the project and those which will expand or locate in the area because of the project. Specify by name, product, service, and operations involved.</p><p class="depth0">Identify any related activities which are defined as interdependent parts of an Rural Development action. Such undertakings are considered interdependent parts whenever they either make possible or support the Rural Development action or are themselves induced or supported by the Rural Development action or another related activity. These activities may have been completed in the very recent past and are now operational or they may reasonably be expected to be accomplished in the near future. Related activities may or may not be Federally permitted or assisted. When they are, identify the involved Federal agency(s).</p><p class="depth0">In completing the remainder of the assessment, it must be remembered that the impacts to be addressed are those which stem from the project, the primary beneficiaries, and the related activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(III)</em> Description of project area. Describe the project site and its present use. Describe the surrounding land uses; indicate the directions and distances involved. The extent of the surrounding land to be considered depends on the extent of the impacts of the project, its related activities, and the primary beneficiaries. Unique or sensitive areas

must be pointed out. These include residential, schools, hospitals, recreational, historical sites, beaches, lakes, rivers, parks, floodplains, wetlands, dunes, estuaries, barrier islands, natural landmarks, unstable soils, steep slopes, aquifer recharge areas, important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangelands, endangered species habitats, or other delicate or rare ecosystems.</p><p class="depth0">Attach adequate location maps of the project area, as well as (1) a U.S. Geological Survey ``15 minute'' (``7\1/2\ minute'' if available) topographic map which clearly delineates the area and the location of the project elements, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development's floodplain map(s) for the project area, (3) site photos, (4) if completed, a standard soil survey for the project and, (5) if available, an aerial photograph of the site.

The maximum loss covered by Form RD 1980-72, ``Loan Note Guarantee DARBE,'' (or successor form) issued on any one borrower can never exceed the percentage of guarantee multiplied by the unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan as evidenced by the note(s) or by assumption agreement(s), and protective advances, or $2,500,000, whichever is the lesser amount.</p><p class="depth0">H. Percentage of guarantee. The provisions of RD instruction 1980-E, Sec.  1980.420 will not apply to DARBE. For loans in excess of $2,000,000, the percentage of guarantee will be calculated so that the guaranteed portion of the principal amount of the loan cannot exceed $2,000,000. For loans of $2,000,000 or less the maximum percentage of guarantee will be 90 percent. For example, a loan of $10,000,000 would not exceed a 20 percent guarantee; a $5,000,000 loan would not exceed a 40 percent guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">I.
