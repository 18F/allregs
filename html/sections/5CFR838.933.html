                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A court order that unequivocally awards a former spouse survivor annuity and directs the former spouse to pay for that benefit satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805, and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the former spouse has also been awarded a portion of the employee annuity then the cost of the survivor benefit will be deducted from the former spouse's share of the employee annuity (if sufficient to cover the total cost--there will be no partial withholding); otherwise,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reduction will be taken from the employee annuity and collection from the former spouse will be a private matter between the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> a court order that conditions the award of a former spouse survivor annuity on the former spouse's payment of the cost of the benefit satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805 only if a court order acceptable for processing also awards the former spouse a portion of the employee annuity sufficient to cover the cost.</p><p class="depth2">Model Paragraphs


Sec. Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 838--Recommended Language for Court</p><p class="depth2">Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor Annuities</p><p class="depth2">This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders awarding former spouse survivor annuities. A former spouse survivor annuity is not a continuation of a former spouse's share of an employee annuity after the death of the employee. A former spouse's entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity cannot continue after the death of the employee. A court order that attempts to extend the former spouse's entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity past the death of the employee is not effective. The model language in this appendix does not award benefits payable to the former spouse during the lifetime of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a portion of the employee annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit during the lifetime of the employee. Appendix A to subpart F of this part contains model language for a portion of an employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Attorneys should exercise great care in preparing provisions concerning former spouse survivor annuities because sections 8341(h)(4) and 8445(d) of title 5, United States Code, prohibit OPM from accepting modifications after the retirement or death of the employee. (See Sec. 838.806 concerning unacceptable modifications.) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity should include four elements:</p><p class="depth2">Identification of the retirement system;</p><p class="depth2">Explicit award of the former spouse survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Method for computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit; and</p><p class="depth2">Instructions on what OPM should do if the employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a refund of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth2">By using the model language, courts will know that the court order will have the effect described in this appendix.</p><p class="depth2">The model language uses the terms ``[former spouse]'' to identify the spouse who is receiving a former spouse survivor annuity and ``[employee]'' to identify the Federal employee whose employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the appropriate terms, such as ``Petitioner'' and ``Respondent,'' or the names of the parties should replace ``[former spouse]'' and ``[employee].''</p><p class="depth2">Similarly, except when the provision applies only to the basic employee death benefit (defined in Sec. 843.103 of this chapter) that is available only under the Federal Employees Retirement System, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (5 U.S.C. 8331 et seq.). The name of the retirement system should be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (5 U.S.C. chapter 84.).</p><p class="depth2">Statutory references used in the models are to CSRS provisions (such as section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code). When appropriate, the corresponding FERS provision (such as section 8445 of title 5, United States Code) should be used.</p><p class="depth2">Table of Contents</p><p class="depth2">700 Series--Computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit.

Situations in which the computational base need not be specified include amounts defined by law or regulation. For example, the maximum former spouse survivor annuity is

fixed by statute generally at 55 percent of the employee annuity under CSRS and 50 percent of the employee annuity under FERS.</p><p class="depth2">Paragraphs 711 and 712 contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities that use the employee annuity as the base on which the portion awarded will be computed (that is, on which percentage, fraction or formula will be applied). Paragraphs 721 and 722 contain model language for awards of former spouse survivor annuities that use the maximum possible survivor annuity as the base on which the portion awarded will be computed (that is, on which percentage, fraction or formula will be applied). Using the maximum possible survivor annuity as the base will generally award 55 percent under CSRS and 50 percent under FERS of the amount that using the employee annuity as the base would produce.</p><p class="depth2">Paragraphs 750 and higher contain model language to implement the most common other types of awards.</p><p class="depth2">Each model paragraph includes a reference to the statutory provision under CSRS that authorizes OPM to honor court orders awarding former spouse survivor annuities. The FERS statutory provision that corresponds to section 8341(h) (mentioned in the first sentence of each example) is section 8445.</p><p class="depth2">701 Award of the maximum survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity. Under CSRS, the maximum possible survivor annuity is 55 percent of the employee annuity unless the surviving spouse or former spouse was married to the retiree at retirement and agreed to a lesser amount at that time. Under FERS, the maximum possible survivor annuity is 50 percent of the employee annuity unless the surviving spouse or former spouse was married to the retiree at retirement and agreed to a lesser amount at that time.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System.''</p><p class="depth2">702 Award that continues the pre-divorce survivor annuity benefits.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor annuity equal to the amount that the former spouse would have received if the marriage were never terminated by divorce.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System in the same amount to which [former spouse] would have been entitled if the divorce had not occurred.''</p><p class="depth2">703 Award of a prorata share.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the maximum possible survivor annuity. Prorata share is defined in Sec. 838.922. To award a prorata share the court order must state the date of the marriage. Unless the court order specifies a different ending date, the marriage ends for computation purposes on the date that the court order is filed with the court clerk.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity will be equal to a prorate share. The marriage began on [insert date].''</p><p class="depth2">704 Award of a fixed monthly amount.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor annuity that will start at the amount stated in the order when the employee or retiree dies, unless the stated amount exceeds the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity. If the amount stated in the order exceeds the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity, the court order will be treated as awarding the maximum. After payment of the former spouse survivor annuity has began, COLA's will be applied in accordance with Sec. 838.735. If the final sentence of this model paragraph is omitted, OPM will add COLA's occurring after the date of the employee's retirement or the date of issuance of the court order, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity will be equal to $[insert a number] per month. The Office of Personnel Management is ordered not to increase this amount by COLA's occurring before death of [employee or retiree].''</p><p class="depth2">705-710 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">711 Award of a percentage or fraction of the employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse survivor annuity equal to the stated percentage or fraction of the employee annuity. The stated percentage or fraction may not exceed 55 percent under CSRS or 50 percent under FERS.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity will be equal to [insert a percentage or fraction] percent of the [employee]'s employee annuity.''</p><p class="depth2">712 Award based on a stated formula as a share of employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraphs will award a former spouse survivor annuity in an amount to be determined by applying a stated formula to employee annuity. The amount of the former spouse survivor annuity may not exceed 55 percent of the employee annuity under CSRS or 50 percent under FERS. The formula must be stated in the court order (including a court-approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court order must include any data that is necessary for OPM to evaluate the formula unless the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded a former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System.

Upon the employee's remarriage before retirement the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity changes to a prorata share.

Upon the employee's remarriage after retirement and election to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse acquired after retirement, the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity changes to a prorata share. The maximum possible and prorata share are used as examples only; other amounts maybe substituted. The change in the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity must be triggered by the election, which is a part of normal OPM files, rather than the remarriage, which is not documented in normal OPM files.</p><p class="depth2">``Under section 8341(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, [former spouse] is awarded the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System unless [employee] elects to provide a survivor annuity for a new spouse acquired after retirement.

The reduction lowers the gross employee annuity. The costs associated with providing the former spouse survivor annuity must be paid by annuity reduction. Under Sec. 838.807, if the former spouse is awarded a portion of the employee annuity sufficient to pay the cost associated with providing the survivor annuity, the former spouse's share maybe reduced to pay the cost.</p><p class="depth2">801 Costs to be paid from the employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">No special provision on payment of the costs associated with providing the former spouse survivor annuity is necessary if the court intends the cost to be taken from the employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">802 Costs to be paid from former spouse's share of the employee annuity.</p><p class="depth2">Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity and a prorata share of the maximum possible survivor annuity and provide that the cost associated with the survivor annuity be deducted from the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.

A refund of employee contributions voids the employee's rights to an employee annuity unless the employee is reemployed under the retirement system.
