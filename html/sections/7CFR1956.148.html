Requests for exceptions must be made in writing  by the State Director and supported with documentation to explain the  adverse effect on the Government's interest, propose alternative courses  of action, and show how the adverse effect will be eliminated or  minimized if the exception is granted. Any settlement actions approved  by the Administrator under this section will be documented on Form FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1956-1 and returned to  the State Office for submission to the Finance Office.
