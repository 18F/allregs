                                Sec. 1.818-3  Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 818(b) provides that the appropriate items  of income, deductions, and adjustments under part I, subchapter L,  chapter 1 of the Code, shall be adjusted to reflect the appropriate  amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount on  bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a  life insurance company. Such adjustments are limited to the amount of  appropriate amortization or accrual attributable to the taxable year  with respect to such securities which are not in default as to principal  or interest and which are amply secured. The question of ample security  will be resolved according to the rules laid down from time to time by  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The adjustment for  amortization of premium decreases the gross investment income, the  exclusion and reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest, the exclusion  and deduction for partially tax-exempt interest, and the basis or  adjusted basis of such securities. The adjustment for accrual of  discount increases the gross investment income, the exclusion and  reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest, the exclusion and deduction  for partially tax-exempt interest, and the basis or adjusted basis of  such securities. However, for taxable years beginning after May 31,  1960, only the accrual of discount relating to issue discount will  increase the exclusion and reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest. See  section 103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisitions before January 1, 1958. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of any such  security acquired before January 1, 1958, the premium is the excess of  its acquisition value over its maturity value and the discount is the  excess of its maturity value over its acquisition value. The acquisition  value of any such security is its cost (including buying commissions or  brokerage but excluding any amounts paid for accrued interest) if  purchased for cash, or if not purchased for cash, its then fair market  value. The maturity value of any such security is the amount payable  thereunder either at the maturity date or an earlier call date. The  earlier call date of any such security may be the earliest interest  payment date if it is callable or payable at such date, the earliest  date at which it is callable at par, or such other call or payment date,  prior to maturity, specified in the security as may be selected by the  life insurance company. A life insurance company which adjusts  amortization of premium or accrual of discount with reference to a  particular call or payment date must make the adjustments with reference  to the value on such date and may not, after selecting such date, use a  different call or payment date, or value, in the calculation of such  amortization or discount with respect to such security unless the  security was not in fact called or paid on such selected date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The adjustments for amortization of premium and accrual of  discount will be determined:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> According to the method regularly employed by the company, if  such method is reasonable, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> According to the method prescribed by this section.  A method of amortization of premium or accrual of discount will be  deemed ``regularly employed'' by a life insurance company if the method  was consistently followed in prior taxable years, or if, in the case of  a company which has never before made such adjustments, the company  initiates in the first taxable year for which the adjustments are made a  reasonable method of amortization of premium or accrual of discount and  consistently follows such method thereafter. Ordinarily, a company  regularly employs a method in accordance with the statute of some State,  Territory, or the District of Columbia, in which it operates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The method of amortization and accrual prescribed by this  section is as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The premium (or discount) shall be determined in accordance with  this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The appropriate amortization of premium (or accrual of  discount) attributable to the taxable year shall be an amount which  bears the same ratio   to the premium (or discount) as the number of months in the taxable year  during which the security was owned by the life insurance company bears  to the number of months between the date of acquisition of the security  and its maturity or earlier call date, determined in accordance with  this section. For purposes of this section, a fractional part of a month  shall be disregarded unless it amounts to more than half a month, in  which case it shall be considered a month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisitions after December 31, 1957. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any bond, as defined in section 171(d), acquired after December  31, 1957, the amount of the premium and the amortizable premium for the  taxable year, shall be determined under section 171(b) and the  regulations thereunder, as if the election set forth in section 171(c)  had been made, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any bond, note, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness  not described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and acquired after  December 31, 1957, the amount of the premium and the amortizable premium  for the taxable year, shall be determined under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of any bond, note, debenture, or other evidence of  indebtedness acquired after December 31, 1957, the amount of the  discount and the accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year  shall be determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Convertible evidences of indebtedness. Section 818(b)(2)(B)  provides that in no case shall the amount of premium on a convertible  evidence of indebtedness (including any bond, note, or debenture)  include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the  evidence of indebtedness. This provision is the same as the one  contained in section 171(b), and the rules prescribed in paragraph (c)  of Sec. 1.171-2 shall be applicable for purposes of section  818(b)(2)(B). This provision is to be applied without regard to the date  upon which the evidence of indebtedness was acquired. Thus, where a  convertible evidence of indebtedness was acquired before January 1,  1958, and a portion or all of the premium attributable to the conversion  features of the evidence of indebtedness has been amortized for taxable  years beginning before January 1, 1958, no adjustment for such  amortization will be required by reason of section 818(b)(2)(B). Such  amortization will, however, require an adjustment to the basis of the  evidence of indebtedness under section 1016(a)(17). For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1957, no further amortization of the  premium attributable to the conversion features of such an evidence of  indebtedness will be taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjustments to basis. Section 1016(a)(17) (relating to  adjustments to basis) provides that in the case of any evidence of  indebtedness referred to in section 818(b) and this section, the basis  shall be adjusted to the extent of the adjustments required under  section 818(b) (or the corresponding provisions of prior income tax  laws) for the taxable year and all prior taxable years. The basis of any  evidence of indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of the  adjustment required under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provision  of prior income tax laws) on account of amortizable premium and shall be  increased by the amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b)  on account of accruable discounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Denial of double inclusion. Any amount which is includible in  gross investment income by reason of section 818(b) and paragraph (a) of  this section shall not be includible in gross income under section  1232(a) (relating to the taxation of bonds and other evidences of  indebtedness). See section 1232(a)(2)(C) and the regulations thereunder.  [T.D. 6558, 26 FR 2786, Apr. 4, 1961]</p>
