                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The SBA establishes small business size standards on an  industry-by-industry basis. (See 13 CFR Part 121). Small business size  standards matched to industry NAICS codes are published by the Small  Business Administration and are available at http://www.sba.gov/content/ table-small-business-size-standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NAICS codes are updated by the Office of Management and Budget  through its Economic Classification Policy Committee every five years.  New NAICS codes are not available for use in Federal contracting until  the Small Business Administration publishes corresponding industry size  standards (see 19.102(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Small business size standards are applied by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Classifying the product or service being acquired in the  industry whose definition, as found in the North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) Manual (available at http:// www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/, best describes the principal nature of  the product or service being acquired;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identifying the size standard SBA established for that industry;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifying the size standard in the solicitation, so that  offerors can appropriately represent themselves as small or large.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For size standard purposes, a product or service shall be  classified in only one industry, whose definition best describes the  principal nature of the product or service being acquired even though  for other purposes it could be classified in more than one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When acquiring a product or service that could be classified in  two or more industries with different size standards, contracting  officers shall apply the size standard for the industry accounting for  the greatest percentage of the contract price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a solicitation calls for more than one item and allows offers  to be submitted on any or all of the items, an offeror must meet the  size standard for each item it offers to furnish. If a solicitation  calling for more than one item requires offers on all or none of the  items, an offeror may qualify as a small business by meeting the size  standard for the item accounting for the greatest percentage of the  total contract price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any concern submitting a bid or offer in its own name, other  than on a construction or service contract, that proposes to furnish an  end product it did not manufacture (a ``nonmanufacturer''), is a small  business if it has no more than 500 employees, and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(4) through (f)(7) of this  section, in the case of Government acquisitions set-aside for small  businesses, furnishes in the performance of the contract, the product of  a small business manufacturer or producer. The end product furnished  must be manufactured or produced in the United States or its outlying  areas. The term ``nonmanufacturer'' includes a concern that can, but  elects not to, manufacture or produce the end product for the specific  acquisition. For size determination purposes, there can be only one  manufacturer of the end product being acquired. The manufacturer of the  end product being acquired is the concern that, with its own forces,  transforms inorganic or organic substances including raw materials and/ or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product. However, see  the limitations on subcontracting at 52.219-14 that apply to any small  business offeror other than a nonmanufacturer for purposes of set-asides  and 8(a) awards, 52.219-3 for HUBZone set-asides and HUBZone sole source  awards, 52.219-27 for SDVOSB set-asides and SDVOSB sole source awards,  52.219-29 for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business set- asides, and 52.219-30 for set-asides for women-owned small business  concerns eligible under the women-owned small business program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A concern which purchases items and packages them into a kit is  considered to be a nonmanufacturer small business and can qualify as  such for a given acquisition if it meets the size qualifications of a  small nonmanufacturer for the acquisition, and if more than 50 percent  of the total value of the kit and its contents are accounted for by  items manufactured by small business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of receiving a Certificate of Competency on an  unrestricted acquisition, a small business nonmanufacturer may furnish  any domestically produced or manufactured product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of acquisitions set aside for small business or  awarded under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, when the  acquisition is for a specific product (or a product in a class of  products) for which the SBA has determined that there are no small  business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market, then the SBA  may grant a class waiver so that a nonmanufacturer does not have to  furnish the product of a small business. For the most current listing of  classes for which SBA has granted a waiver, contact an SBA Office of  Government Contracting. A listing is also available on SBA's Internet  Homepage at http://www.sba.gov/content/class-waivers. Contracting  officers may request that the SBA waive the nonmanufacturer rule for a  particular class of products. For procedures in requesting a waiver see  13 CFR 121.1204.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For a specific solicitation, a contracting officer may request a  waiver of that part of the nonmanufacturer   rule which requires that the actual manufacturer or processor be a small  business concern if the contracting officer determines that no known  domestic small business manufacturers or processors can reasonably be  expected to offer a product meeting the requirements of the  solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Requests for waivers shall be sent to the Associate  Administrator for Government Contracting, United States Small Business  Administration, Mail Code 6250, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC  20416.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The SBA provides for an exception to the nonmanufacturer rule  if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The procurement of a manufactured end product processed under  the procedures set forth in part 13--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is set aside for small business; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is not anticipated to exceed $25,000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The offeror supplies an end product that is manufactured or  produced in the United States or its outlying areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For non-manufacturer rules pertaining to HUBZone contracts, see  19.1303(e).  [48 FR 42240, Sept. 19, 1983]</p><p class="depth3">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting 19.102, see  the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids  section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 19.2_Policies</p>
