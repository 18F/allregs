Provided, however, That such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of the members thereof as such producers or purchasers and conform to one or both of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2">First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he may own therein; and</p><p class="depth2">Second.
