                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person may dispatch or release for flight a turbine-engine powered airplane with more than two engines for a flight more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruise power) from an Adequate Airport unless the following fuel supply requirements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airplane has enough fuel to meet the requirements of Sec. 121.645(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The airplane has enough fuel to fly to the Adequate Airport--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assuming a descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of Sec. 121.333; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Considering expected wind and other weather conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The airplane has enough fuel to hold for 15 minutes at 1500 feet above field elevation and conduct a normal approach and landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No person may dispatch or release for flight an ETOPS flight unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has the fuel otherwise required by this part and enough fuel to satisfy each of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fuel to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fuel to account for rapid decompression and engine failure. The airplane must carry the greater of the following amounts of fuel:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of Sec. 121.333 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed) assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen requirements of Sec. 121.333 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one engine inoperative cruise speed) assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel to account for errors in wind forecasting. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the certificate holder must increase the actual forecast wind speed by 5% (resulting in an increase in headwind or a decrease in tailwind) to account for any potential errors in wind forecasting. If a certificate holder is not using the actual forecast wind based on a wind model accepted by the FAA, the airplane must carry additional fuel equal to 5% of the fuel required for paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, as reserve fuel to allow for errors in wind data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fuel to account for icing. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the certificate holder must ensure that the

airplane carries the greater of the following amounts of fuel in anticipation of possible icing during the diversion:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fuel that would be burned as a result of airframe icing during 10 percent of the time icing is forecast (including the fuel used by engine and wing anti-ice during this period).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fuel that would be used for engine anti-ice, and if appropriate wing anti-ice, for the entire time during which icing is forecast.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fuel to account for engine deterioration. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the airplane also carries fuel equal to 5% of the fuel specified above, to account for deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance unless the certificate holder has a program to monitor airplane in-service deterioration to cruise fuel burn performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel to account for holding, approach, and landing. In addition to the fuel required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the airplane must carry fuel sufficient to hold at 1500 feet above field elevation for 15 minutes upon reaching an ETOPS Alternate Airport and then conduct an instrument approach and land.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel to account for APU use. If an APU is a required power source, the certificate holder must account for its fuel consumption during the appropriate phases of flight.
