                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> GFI. The Government shall share GFI with DIB participants or  designated SPs in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial incident reporting. The DIB participant shall report to  DC3/DCISE cyber incidents involving covered defense information on a  covered DIB system. These initial reports will be provided within 72  hours of discovery. DIB participants also may report other cyber  incidents to the Government if the DIB participant determines the  incident may be relevant to information assurance for covered defense  information or covered DIB systems or other information assurance  activities of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Follow-up reporting. After an initial incident report, the  Government and the DIB participant may voluntarily share additional  information that is determined to be relevant to a reported incident,  including information regarding forensic analyses, mitigation and  remediation, and cyber intrusion damage assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cyber intrusion damage assessment. Following analysis of a cyber  incident, DC3/DCISE may provide information relevant to the potential or  known compromise of DoD acquisition program information to the Office of  the   Secretary of Defense's Damage Assessment Management Office (OSD DAMO)  for a cyber intrusion damage assessment. The Government may provide DIB  participants with information regarding the damage assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DIB participant attribution information. The Government  acknowledges that information shared by the DIB participants under this  program may include extremely sensitive proprietary, commercial, or  operational information that is not customarily shared outside of the  company, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information  could cause substantial competitive harm to the DIB participant that  reported that information. The Government shall take reasonable steps to  protect against the unauthorized use or release of such information  (e.g., attribution information and other nonpublic information) received  from a DIB participant or derived from such information provided by a  DIB participant, including applicable procedures (see Sec. 236.5(h)).  The Government will restrict its internal use and disclosure of  attribution information to only Government personnel and Government  support contractors that are bound by appropriate confidentiality  obligations and restrictions relating to the handling of this sensitive  information and are engaged in lawfully authorized activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Non-attribution information. The Government may share non- attribution information that was provided by a DIB participant (or  derived from information provided by a DIB participant) with other DIB  participants in the DIB CS/IA program, and may share such information  throughout the Government (including with Government support contractors  that are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations) for cyber  security and information assurance purposes for the protection of  Government information or information systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Electronic media. Electronic media/files provided by DIB  participants to DC3 under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section  are maintained by the digital and multimedia forensics laboratory at  DC3, which implements specialized handling procedures to maintain its  accreditation as a digital and multimedia forensics laboratory. DC3 will  maintain, control, and dispose of all electronic media/files provided by  DIB participants to DC3 in accordance with established DoD policies and  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Agency records, which may  include qualifying information received from non-federal entities, are  subject to request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)  (FOIA), which is implemented in the Department of Defense by DoD  Directive 5400.07 and DoD Regulation 5400.7-R (see 32 CFR Parts 285 and  286, respectively). Pursuant to established procedures and applicable  regulations, the Government will protect sensitive nonpublic information  under this Program against unauthorized public disclosure by asserting  applicable FOIA exemptions, and will inform the non-Government source or  submitter (e.g., DIB participants) of any such information that may be  subject to release in response to a FOIA request, to permit the source  or submitter to support the withholding of such information or pursue  any other available legal remedies.</p>
