                            <p class="depth0">Underpayments will be adjusted as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> for a different period, we  will apply any underpayment due the individual to reduce that  overpayment, unless we have waived recovery of the overpayment under the  provisions of Secs. 404.506 through 404.512.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual dies before adjustment of underpayment. If an  individual who has been underpaid dies before receiving payment or  negotiating a check or checks representing such payment, we first apply  any amounts due the deceased individual against any overpayments as  defined in Sec. 404.501(a) owed by the deceased individual, unless we  have waived recovery of such overpayment under the provisions of  Secs. 404.506 through 404.512. We then will distribute any remaining  underpayment to the living person (or persons) in the highest order of  priority as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The deceased individual's surviving spouse as defined in section  216(c), (g), or (h) of the Act who was either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Living in the same household (as defined in Sec. 404.347) with  the deceased individual at the time of such individual's death, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same earnings  record as was the deceased individual for the month in which such  individual died.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The child or children of the deceased individual (as defined in  section 216 (e) or (h) of the Act) entitled to a monthly benefit on the  basis of the same earnings record as was the deceased individual for the  month in which such individual died (if more than one such child, in  equal shares to each such child).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The parent or parents of the deceased individual, entitled to a  monthly benefit on the basis of the same earnings record as was the  deceased individual for the month in which such individual died (if more  than one such parent, in equal shares to each such parent). For this  purpose, the definition of ``parent'' in Sec. 404.374 includes the  parent(s) of any deceased individual who was entitled to benefits under  title II of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The surviving spouse of the deceased individual (as defined in  section 216(c), (g), or (h) of the Act) who does not qualify under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The child or children of the deceased individual (as defined in  section 216 (e) or (h) of the Act) who do not qualify under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section (if more than one such child, in equal shares to  each such child).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The parent or parents of the deceased individual, who do not  qualify under paragraph (b)(3) of this section (if more than one such  parent, in equal shares to each such parent). For this purpose, the  definition of ``parent'' in Sec. 404.374 includes the parent(s) of any  deceased individual who was entitled to benefits under title II of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The legal representative of the estate of the deceased  individual as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that a person who is otherwise qualified to receive  an underpayment under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section,  dies before receiving payment or before negotiating the check or checks  representing such payment, his share of the underpayment will be divided  among the remaining living person(s) in the same order of priority. In  the event that there is (are) no other such person(s), the underpayment  will be paid to the living person(s) in the next lower order of priority  under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition of legal representative. The term legal  representative, for the purpose of qualifying to receive an  underpayment, generally means the administrator or executor of the  estate of the deceased individual. However, it may also include an  individual, institution or organization acting on behalf of an  unadministered estate, provided that such person can give the  Administration good acquittance (as defined in paragraph (e) of this  section). The following persons may qualify as legal representative for  the purposes of this subpart, provided they can give the Administration  good acquittance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A person who qualifies under a State's small estate statute,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person resident in a foreign country who, under the laws and  customs of that country, has the right to receive assets of the estate,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A public administrator, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A person who has the authority, under applicable law, to collect  the assets of the estate of the deceased individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definition of ``good acquittance.'' A person is considered to  give the Administration good acquittance when payment to that person  will release the Administration from further liability for such payment.
