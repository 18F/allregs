                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you produce engines that are subject to the requirements of  this part, you must test them as described in this subpart, except as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit testing under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We may suspend or revoke your certificate of conformity for  certain engine families if your production-line engines do not meet the  requirements of this part or you do not fulfill your obligations under  this subpart (see Sec. Sec.  1042.325 and 1042.340).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other regulatory provisions authorize us to suspend, revoke, or  void your certificate of conformity, or order recalls for engine  families, without regard to whether they have passed these production- line testing requirements. The requirements of this subpart do not  affect our ability to do selective enforcement audits, as described in  40 CFR part 1068. Individual engines in families that pass these  production-line testing requirements must also conform to all applicable  regulations of this part and 40 CFR part 1068.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may use alternate programs or measurement methods for  testing production-line engines in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may test your engines using the CumSum procedures specified  in 40 CFR part 1045 or 1051 instead of the procedures specified in this  subpart, except that the threshold for establishing quarterly or annual  test periods is based on U.S.-directed production volumes of 800 instead  of 1600. This alternate program does not require prior approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may ask to use another alternate program or measurement  method for testing production-line engines. In your request, you must  show us that the alternate program gives equal assurance that your  engines meet the requirements of this part. We may waive some or all of  this subpart's requirements if we approve your alternate program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you certify a Category 1 or Category 2 engine family with  carryover emission data, as described in Sec.  1042.235(d), and these  equivalent engine families consistently pass the production-line testing  requirements over the preceding two-year period, you may ask for a  reduced testing rate for further production-line testing for that  family. The minimum testing rate is one engine per engine family. If we  reduce your testing rate, we may limit our approval to any number of  model years. In determining whether to approve your request, we may  consider the number of engines that have failed the emission tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We may ask you to make a reasonable number of production-line  engines available for a reasonable time so we can test or inspect them  for compliance with the requirements of this part. For Category 3  engines, you are not required to deliver engines to us, but we may  inspect and test your engines at any facility at which they are  assembled or installed in vessels.
