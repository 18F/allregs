                            <p class="depth0">The Fair Labor Standards Act has applied since 1938 to all  employees, not specifically exempted, who are engaged (a) in interstate  or foreign commerce or (b) in the production of goods for such commerce,  which is defined to include any closely related process or occupation  directly essential to such production (29 U.S.C. 206(a), 207(a); and see  Sec. Sec. 784.12 to 784.15 for definitions governing the scope of this  coverage). In general, employees of businesses concerned with fisheries  and with operations on seafood and other aquatic products are engaged in  interstate or foreign commerce, or in the production of goods for such  commerce, as defined in the Act, and are subject to the Act's provisions  except as otherwise provided in sections 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) or other  express exemptions. A detailed discussion of the activities in commerce  or in the production of goods for commerce which will bring an employee  under the Act is contained in part 776 of this chapter, dealing with  general coverage.</p>
