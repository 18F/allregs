Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by RCRA.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0">Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in approved States, including any approved modifications or revisions.
