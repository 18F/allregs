                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary Note: This section is available only to communications  relating to business combinations. The exemption does not apply to  communications that may be in technical compliance with this section,  but have the primary purpose or effect of conditioning the market for  another transaction, such as a capital-raising or resale transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Communications. In a registered offering involving a business  combination transaction, any communication made in connection with or  relating to the transaction before the first public announcement of the  offering will not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an  offer to buy the securities offered for purposes of section 5(c) of the  Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(c)), so long as the participants take all reasonable  steps within their control to prevent further distribution or  publication of the communication until either the first public  announcement is made or the registration statement related to the  transaction is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The terms business combination transaction,  participant and public announcement have the same meaning as set forth  in Sec. 230.165(f).  [64 FR 61450, Nov. 10, 1999]</p>
