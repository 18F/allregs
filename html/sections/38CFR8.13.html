                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At any time after the premiums for the first policy year have  been paid and earned and before default in payment of any subsequent  premium, and upon the execution of a loan agreement satisfactory to the  Secretary, the United States will lend to the insured on the security of  his or her National Service Life Insurance policy, any amount which will  not exceed 94 percent of the reserve, and any indebtedness on the policy  shall be deducted from the amount advanced on such loan. At any time  before default in the payment of the premium, the loan may be repaid in  full or in amounts of $5 or more. Failure to pay either the amount of  the loan or the interest thereon shall not make the policy voidable  unless the total indebtedness shall equal or exceed the cash value. When  the amount of the indebtedness equals or exceeds the cash value, the  policy shall become voidable. On loans applied for before the effective  date of this regulation (November 2, 1987) and not exchanged pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section, the policy loan interest rate in effect  when the loan was applied for shall not be increased for the term of the  loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loans applied for or exchanged on and after the effective date  of this regulation (November 2, 1987) shall bear interest at a rate  which may be varied during the term of the loan, not more frequently  than once a year, as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.  After October 1, 1988, the policy loan rate shall not be varied more  frequently than once a year. Notification of the initial rate of  interest on new loans will be forwarded at the time the loan is made.  Policyholders with existing variable rate loans will be forwarded  reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate. Reasonable  advance notice of any change in the variable loan rate will be published  in the Federal Register. A notice pertaining to variable loans which is  sent to the policyholder's last address of record will constitute  sufficient evidence of notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, loan  rates established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall equal  the yield on the Ten-Year Constant Maturities Index for U.S. Treasury  Securities for the month of June of the year of calculation rounded down  to the next whole percentage. Such loan rate shall be effective on the  date on or after the first day of October on which the rate change is  made in the insurance automatic data processing system, and shall remain  in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment.  The prevailing variable loan rate   shall apply to all loans granted under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the  variable loan rate shall not exceed 12 percent or be lower than 5  percent per annum.
