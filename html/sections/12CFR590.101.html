                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 501 provides that ``the provisions of the constitution  or laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest,  discount points, finance charges, or other charges shall not apply to  any'' federally-related loan secured by a first lien on residential real  property, a residential manufactured home, or all the stock allocated to  a dwelling unit in a residential housing cooperative. 12 U.S.C. 1735f-7  note (Supp. IV 1980). The question has arisen as to whether the federal  statute   preempts a state law which deems it a criminal offense to charge  interest at a rate in excess of that specified in the state law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the Office's view, section 501 preempts all state laws which  expressly limit the rate or amount of interest chargeable on a  federally-related residential first mortgage. It does not matter whether  the statute in question imposes criminal or civil sanctions; section  501, by its terms, preempts ``any'' state law which imposes a ceiling on  interest rates. The wording of the federal statute clearly expresses an  intent to displace all direct state law restraints on interest. Any  state law that conflicts with this Congressional purpose must yield.</p>
