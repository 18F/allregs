                                Sec. 225.92  How does an election by a foreign bank become effective?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An election described in Sec. 225.91 is effective on the 31st day after the date that an election was received by the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, unless the Board notifies the foreign bank or company prior to that time that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The election is ineffective; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The period is extended with the consent of the foreign bank or company making the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Earlier notification that an election is effective. The Board or the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank may notify a foreign bank or company that its election to be treated as a financial holding company is effective prior to the 31st day after the election was filed with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank. Such notification must be in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under what circumstances will the Board find an election to be ineffective? An election to be treated as a financial holding company shall not be effective if, during the period provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board finds that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The foreign bank certificant, or any foreign bank that operates a branch or agency or owns or controls a commercial lending company in the United States and is controlled by a foreign bank or company certificant, is not both well capitalized and well managed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any U.S. insured depository institution subsidiary of the foreign bank or company (except an institution excluded under paragraph (d) of this section) or any U.S. branch of a foreign bank that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has not achieved at least a rating of ``satisfactory record of meeting community needs'' under the Community Reinvestment Act at the institution's most recent examination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any U.S. depository institution subsidiary of the foreign bank or company is not both well capitalized and well managed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Board does not have sufficient information to assess whether the foreign bank or company making the election meets the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> How is CRA performance of recently acquired insured depository institutions considered? An insured depository institution will be excluded for purposes of the review of CRA ratings described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section consistent with the provisions of Sec. 225.82(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Factors used in the Board's determination regarding comparability of capital and management--(1) In general. In determining whether a foreign bank is well capitalized and well managed in accordance with comparable capital and management standards, the Board will give due regard to national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity. In this regard, the Board may take into account the foreign bank's composition of capital, Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio, accounting standards, long-term debt ratings, reliance on government support to meet capital requirements, the foreign bank's anti-money laundering procedures, whether the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis,

and other factors that may affect analysis of capital and management. The Board will consult with the home country supervisor for the foreign bank as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

A foreign bank that is not subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by its home country authorities may not be considered well capitalized and well managed unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The home country has made significant progress in establishing arrangements for comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign bank is in strong financial condition as demonstrated, for example, by capital levels that significantly exceed the minimum levels that are required for a well capitalized determination and strong asset quality.</p>
