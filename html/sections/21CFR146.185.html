                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pineapple juice is the juice, intended for direct  consumption, obtained by mechanical process from the flesh or parts  thereof, with or without core material, of sound, ripe pineapple (Ananas  comosus L. Merrill). The juice may have been concentrated and later  reconstituted with water suitable for the purpose of maintaining  essential composition and quality factors of the juice. Pineapple juice  may contain finely divided insoluble solids, but it does not contain  pieces of shell, seeds, or other coarse or hard substances or excess  pulp. It may be sweetened with any safe and suitable dry nutritive  carbohydrate sweetener. However, if the pineapple juice is prepared from  concentrate, such sweeteners, in liquid   form, also may be used. It may contain added vitamin C in a quantity  such that the total vitamin C in each 4 fluid ounces of the finished  food amounts to not less than 30 milligrams and not more than 60  milligrams. In the processing of pineapple juice, di methyl poly sil  oxane complying with the requirements of Sec. 173.340 of this chapter  may be employed as a defoaming agent in an amount not greater than 10  parts per million by weight of the finished food. Such food is prepared  by heat sterilization, refrigeration, or freezing. When sealed in a  container to be held at ambient temperatures, it is so processed by  heat, before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the food is ``Pineapple juice'' if the juice from  which it is prepared has not been concentrated and/or diluted with  water. The name of the food is ``Pineapple juice from concentrate'' if  the finished juice has been made from pineapple juice concentrate as  specified in paragraph (a) of this section. If a nutritive sweetener is  added, the label shall bear the statement ``Sweetener added.'' If no  sweetener is added, the word ``Unsweetened'' may immediately precede or  follow the words ``Pineapple juice'' or ``Pineapple juice from  concentrate.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quality. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standard of quality for pineapple juice is as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The soluble solids content of pineapple juice (exclusive of  added sugars) without added water shall not be less than 10.5 Brix as  determined by refractometer at 20 C uncorrected for acidity and read as  degrees Brix on International Sucrose Scales. Where the juice has been  obtained using concentrated juice with addition of water, the soluble  pineapple juice solids content (exclusive of added sugars) shall be not  less than 12.8 Brix, uncorrected for acidity and read as degrees Brix  on the International Sucrose Scales.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, is not more than 1.35 grams of  anhydrous citric acid per 100 milliliters of the juice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, is  not less than 12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> of this  section, is not less than 5 percent nor more than 30 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The methods referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are  as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the degrees Brix of the pineapple juice by the method  prescribed in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of  Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), section 31.009,  ``Solids by Means of Spindle--Official Final Action,'' which is  incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC  INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD  20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA).

Place the tube in a suitable centrifuge the  approximate speed of which is related to diameter of swing in accordance  with the table immediately below. The word ``diameter'' means the over- all distance between   the tips of opposing centrifuge tubes in operating position.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Approximate</p><p class="depth4">Diameter (inches)                       revolutions</p><p class="depth4">per minute ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10.........................................................        1,609 10\1/2\....................................................        1,570 11.........................................................        1,534 11\1/2\....................................................        1,500 12.........................................................        1,468 12\1/2\....................................................        1,438 13.........................................................        1,410 13\1/2\....................................................        1,384 14.........................................................        1,359 14\1/2\....................................................        1,336 15.........................................................        1,313 15\1/2\....................................................        1,292 16.........................................................        1,271 16\1/2\....................................................        1,252 17.........................................................        1,234 17\1/2\....................................................        1,216 18.........................................................        1,199 18\1/2\....................................................        1,182 19.........................................................        1,167 19\1/2\....................................................        1,152 20.........................................................        1,137 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   The milliliter reading at the top of the layer of ``insoluble solids,''  after centrifuging 3 minutes, is multiplied by two to obtain the  percentage of ``insoluble solids.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the quality of pineapple juice falls below the standard  prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the  general statement of substandard quality specified in Sec. 130.14 (a) of  this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fill of container. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standard of fill of container for  pineapple juice, except when the food is frozen, is not less than 90  percent of the total capacity of the container, as determined by the  general method for fill of container prescribed in Sec. 130.12(b) of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If pineapple juice falls below the standard of fill of container  prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the  statement of substandard fill specified in Sec. 130.14(b) of this  chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
