Each BIA regional office updates the IRRTIP for each State in its service area to reflect changes in the TTIPs or tribal project listings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the first quarter of the fiscal year each BIA Regional Office notifies tribes of the update and provides projected IRR Program funding amounts and a copy of the previous year's regional IRRTIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tribe reviews any new transportation planning information, priority lists, and TTIP and forwards an updated TTIP or project listing to BIA Regional Office on or before July 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The BIA regional office reviews all submitted information with the tribes. BIA adds agreed-upon updates, including previously approved amendments (see Sec. 170.427), to the IRRTIP so that the Secretaries can approve the new updated IRRTIP before the start of the next fiscal year.</p>
