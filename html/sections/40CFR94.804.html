                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. (1) Unless otherwise specified, any person may apply for the exemptions allowed by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise specified, any person may apply for the exemptions allowed by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section describes the provisions that apply to temporary exemptions. Paragraph (c) of this section describes provisions that apply to permanent exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications for exemption under this section shall be mailed to the Designated Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonconforming engine that qualifies for a temporary exemption under this paragraph (b) may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for a temporary exemption from the Administrator shall contain the information required in Sec. 94.803. Noncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph (b) will be considered unlawful importation and may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond, exportation of the engine, and/or imposition of civil penalties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exemption for repairs or alterations. A person may conditionally import

under bond a nonconforming engine solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing exemption. A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine for testing, subject to the requirements of Sec. 94.905. A test engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer, and subsequently granted by EPA, concerning the engine in accordance with Sec. 94.905 for a subsequent one-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Display exemptions. A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine solely for display purposes, subject to both of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A display engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of an engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A nonconforming engine that qualifies for a permanent exemption under this paragraph (c) may be admitted into the United States if prior written approval is obtained from the Administrator. A written request for a permanent exemption from the Administrator shall contain the information required in Sec. 94.803. Noncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) will be considered unlawful importation and may result in the exportation of the engine and/or imposition of civil penalties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> National security exemption. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine may be permanently imported into the United States under the national security exemption found in Sec. 94.908.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Competition exemption.

(Note: Prior to certification, manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may import uncertified engines for testing, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The engine may not be placed into non-marine service prior to being installed in a vessel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The importer must obtain written approval from the Administrator prior to admission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The engine and engine container must be labeled as specified by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A manufacturer importing an engine under this exemption must modify the engine to comply with the requirements of this part.</p>
