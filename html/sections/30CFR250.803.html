                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For all production platforms, you must comply with the following production safety system requirements, in addition to the requirements of Sec.  250.802 of this subpart and the requirements of API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Design, installation, and operation of additional production systems--(1) Pressure and fired vessels. Pressure and fired vessels must be designed, fabricated, and code stamped in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections I, IV, and VIII of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Pressure and fired vessels must

have maintenance inspection, rating, repair, and alteration performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of API Pressure Vessel Inspections Code: In-Service Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, API 510 (except Sections 5.8 and 9.5) (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pressure and fired vessels. Pressure and fired vessels must be designed, fabricated, and code stamped in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections I, IV, and VIII of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Pressure and fired vessels must

have maintenance inspection, rating, repair, and alteration performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of API Pressure Vessel Inspections Code: In-Service Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, API 510 (except Sections 5.8 and 9.5) (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pressure relief valves shall be designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The relief valves shall conform to the valve-sizing and pressure-relieving requirements specified in these documents; however, the relief valves, except completely redundant relief valves, shall be set no higher than the maximum-allowable working pressure of the vessel. All relief valves and vents shall be piped in such a way as to prevent fluid from striking personnel or ignition sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Steam generators operating at less than 15 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) shall be equipped with a level safety low (LSL) sensor which will shut off the fuel supply when the water level drops below the minimum safe level. Steam generators operating at greater than 15 psig require, in addition to an LSL, a water-feeding device which will automatically control the water level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels at any time when there is a change in operating pressures that requires new settings for the high-pressure shut-in sensor and/or the low-pressure shut-in sensor as provided herein. The pressure-recorder charts used to determine current operating pressure ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently available to the District Manager. The high-pressure shut-in sensor shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above the highest operating pressure of the vessel. This setting shall also be set sufficiently below (5 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater) the relief valve's set pressure to assure that the pressure source is shut in before the relief valve activates. The low-pressure shut-in sensor shall activate no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, below the lowest pressure in the operating range. The activation of low-pressure sensors on pressure vessels which operate at less than 5 psi shall be approved by the District Manager on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flowlines. (i) You must equip flowlines from wells with high- and low-pressure shut-in sensors located in accordance with section A.1 and Figure A1 of API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new operating pressure ranges of flowlines at any time when there is a significant change in operating pressures. The most recent pressure-recorder charts used to determine operating pressure ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently available to the District Manager. The high-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above the highest operating pressure of the line. But in all cases, it shall be set sufficiently below the maximum shut-in wellhead pressure or the gas-lift supply pressure to assure actuation of the SSV. The low-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, below the lowest operating pressure of the line in which it is installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must equip flowlines from wells with high- and low-pressure shut-in sensors located in accordance with section A.1 and Figure A1 of API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).

Only ESD stations at the boat landing may utilize a loop of breakable synthetic tubing in lieu of a valve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Closure of the SSV shall not exceed 45 seconds after automatic detection of an abnormal condition or actuation of an ESD. The surface-controlled SSSV shall close in not more than 2 minutes after the shut-in signal has closed the SSV. Design-delayed closure time greater than 2 minutes shall be justified by the lessee based on the individual well's mechanical/production characteristics and be approved by the District Manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A schematic of the ESD which indicates the control functions of all safety devices for the platforms shall be maintained by the lessee on the platform or at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or other location conveniently available to the District Manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Engines: (i) Engine exhaust. You must equip engine exhausts to comply with the insulation and personnel protection requirements of API RP 14C, section 4.2c(4) (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198).

that the compressor unit and the associated vessels can be isolated from all input sources. All automatic SDV's installed in compressor suction and fuel gas piping shall also be actuated by the shutdown of the prime mover. Unless otherwise approved by the District Manager, gas--well gas affected by the closure of the automatic SDV on a compressor suction shall be diverted to the pipeline or shut in at the wellhead.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A blowdown valve is required on the discharge line of all compressor installations of 1,000 horsepower (746 kilowatts) or greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Firefighting systems.
