                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complaint of substantial violation. Any person may file a  written complaint with the Assistant Administrator alleging that a  substantial violation of any regulation issued under the Motor Carrier  Safety Act of 1984 is occurring or has occurred within the preceding 60  days. A substantial violation is one which could reasonably lead to, or  has resulted in, serious personal injury or death. Each complaint must  be signed by the complainant and must contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the person who files  it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and address of the alleged violator and, with respect  to each alleged violator, the specific provisions of the regulations  that the complainant believes were violated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A concise but complete statement of the facts relied upon to  substantiate each allegation, including the date of each alleged  violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action on complaint of substantial violation. Upon the filing of  a complaint of a substantial violation under paragraph (a) of this  section, the Assistant Administrator shall determine whether it is  nonfrivolous and meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section. If the Assistant Administrator determines the complaint is  nonfrivolous and meets the requirements of paragraph (a), he/she shall  investigate the complaint. The complainant shall be timely notified of  findings resulting from such investigation. The Assistant Administrator  shall not be required to conduct separate investigations of duplicative  complaints. If the Assistant Administrator determines the complaint is  frivolous or does not meet the requirements of the paragraph (a), he/she  shall dismiss the complaint and notify the complainant in writing of the  reasons for such dismissal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of section 552 of title 5, United  States Code, the Assistant Administrator shall not disclose the identity  of complainants unless it is determined that such disclosure is  necessary to prosecute a violation. If disclosure becomes necessary, the  Assistant Administrator shall take every practical means within the  Assistant Administrator's authority to assure that the complainant is  not subject to harassment, intimidation, disciplinary action,  discrimination, or financial loss as a result of such disclosure.
