Engineered products suitable for non-structural outdoor needs such as exterior signs, trash can holders, and dimensional letters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acoustical composite panels. Engineered products designed for use as structural and sound deadening material suitable for office partitions and doors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interior panels. Engineered products designed specifically for interior applications and providing a surface that is impact-, scratch-, and wear-resistant and that does not absorb or retain moisture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Structural interior panels. Engineered products designed for use in structural construction applications, including cabinetry, casework, paneling, and decorative panels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Structural wall panels.

Engineered products designed to serve as horizontal work surfaces in locations such as kitchens, break rooms or other food preparation areas, bathrooms or lavatories, and workrooms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum biobased content. The minimum biobased content requirement for all composite panels shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plastic lumber composite panels--23 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acoustical composite panels--37 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interior panels--55 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Structural interior panels--89 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Structural wall panels--94 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Countertops--89 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preference compliance dates. (1) No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for those qualifying biobased composite panels specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. By that date, Federal agencies that have the

responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased composite panels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for those qualifying biobased composite panels specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.

responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased composite panels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No later than June 11, 2014, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for those qualifying biobased composite panels specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased composite panels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determining overlap with an EPA-designated recovered content product. Qualifying biobased products that fall under this item may, in some cases, overlap with the following EPA-designated recovered content products: Laminated Paperboard and Structural Fiberboard; Shower and Restroom Dividers; and Signage. USDA is requesting that manufacturers of these qualifying biobased products provide information on the BioPreferred Web site of qualifying biobased products about the intended uses of the product, information on whether or not the product contains any recovered material, in addition to biobased ingredients, and performance standards against which the product has been tested. This information will assist Federal agencies in determining whether or not a qualifying biobased product overlaps with EPA-designated laminated paperboard, structural fiberboard, shower and restroom dividers, and signage, and which product should be afforded the preference in purchasing.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (d): Composite panel products within this designated item can be made with recycled material. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, section 6002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated laminated paperboard and structural fiberboard, shower and restroom dividers, and signage containing recovered materials as items for which Federal agencies must give preference in their purchasing programs. The designation can be found in the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline, 40 CFR 247.12. EPA provides recovered materials content recommendations for laminated paperboard and structural fiberboard, shower and restroom dividers, and signage in the Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN) published for these products. The RMAN recommendations can be found by accessing EPA's Web site http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm and then clicking on the appropriate product name.
