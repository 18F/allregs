                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The protest procedures described in this section are  separate and distinct from those governing size protests and appeals.  All protests relating to whether a concern is a ``small'' business for  purposes of any Federal program, including SDB set-asides and SDB  evaluation adjustments, must be filed and processed pursuant to part 121  of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All protests challenging the disadvantaged status of  a concern with respect to a particular Federal procurement requirement  must be submitted in writing to the procuring activity contracting  officer, except in cases where the contracting officer or SBA initiates  a protest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any contracting officer who initiates a protest must submit the  protest in writing to SBA in accord with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where SBA initiates a protest, the protest must be  submitted in writing to the DC/SDBCE and notification provided in accord  with Sec. 124.1022(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timeliness of protest--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SDB evaluation adjustment and set- aside protests--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. In order for a protest to be timely, it  must be received by the contracting officer prior to the close of  business on the fifth day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal  holidays, after the bid opening date for sealed bids, or after the  receipt from the contracting officer of notification of the identity of  the prospective awardee in negotiated acquisitions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Oral protests. An oral protest relating to an SDB set-aside or  SDB evaluation adjustment made to the contracting officer within the  allotted 5-day period will be considered a timely protest only if the  contracting officer receives a confirming letter postmarked, FAXed, or  delivered no later than one calendar day after the date of such oral  protest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Protests of contracting officers or SBA. The time limitations  in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to contracting  officers or SBA, and they may file protests before or after awards,  except to the extent set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Untimely protests. A protest received after the time limits set  forth in this paragraph (c)(1) will be dismissed by SBA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 8(d) protests. In connection with an 8(d) subcontract,  the contracting officer or SBA must submit a protest to the DC/SDBCE  prior to the   completion of performance by the intended 8(d) subcontractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Premature protests. A protest in connection with any procurement  which is submitted by any person, including the contracting officer,  before bid opening or notification of intended award, whichever applies,  will be considered premature, and will be returned to the protestor  without action. A contracting officer that receives a premature protest  must return it to the protestor without submitting it to the SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Referral to SBA. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any contracting officer who receives a  protest that is not premature must promptly forward it to the SBA's DC/ SDBCE, 409 3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer's referral of a protest to SBA must  contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The written protest and any accompanying materials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the protest was received by the contracting  officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the protested concern's selfrepresentation as an  SDB, and the date of such self-representation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The date of bid opening or the date on which notification of  the apparent successful offeror was sent to all unsuccessful offerors,  as applicable.
