Any one of the following defects or combination thereof,  the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect  shall be considered as damage:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discoloration of the shell which is medium gray to black and  affects more than one-eighth of the surface in the aggregate. Normal  variations of a reddish or brownish color shall not be considered  discoloration;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adhering hulls which cover more than 5 percent of the shell  surface in the aggregate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Broken shells when a portion of the shell is missing, or the  shell is broken or fractured to the extent that moderate pressure will  permit the kernel to become dislodged;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insect injury when the insect, web or frass is present or there  is definite evidence of insect feeding;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mold, when visible on the kernel, except when white or gray and  easily rubbed off with the fingers;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Gum, when a film of shiny, resinous appearing substance affects  an area aggregating more than the equivalent of a circle one-quarter  inch (6.4 mm) in diameter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Skin discoloration when more than one-half of the surface of the  kernel is affected by very dark or black stains contrasting with the  natural color of the skin;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Shriveling when the kernel is excessively thin for its size, or  when materially withered, shrunken, leathery, tough or only partially  developed: Provided, that partially developed kernels are not considered  damaged if more than three-fourths of the pellicle is filled with meat.  An almond containing two kernels shall not be classed as damaged if  either kernel has more than three-fourths of the pellicle filled with  meat; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Brown spot which affects an aggregate area on the kernel greater  than   the area of a circle one-eighth inch (3.2 mm) in diameter.</p>
