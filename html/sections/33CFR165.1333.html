                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Location. The following areas are security zones: all navigable waters within 500 yards of each designated participating vessel while each such vessel is in the Sector Puget Sound Captain of the Port (COTP) zone, as defined in 33 CFR 3.65-10, during a time specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The Coast Guard will publish a notice in the Federal Register each year at least 03 days before the start of the Seattle Seafair Fleet Week to identify the designated participating vessels for that year. The Coast Guard will also provide this information in the Local Notice to Mariners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2">Designated participating vessel means a military vessel participating in the Seattle Seafair Fleet Week that has been designated by the Sector Puget Sound COTP in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2">Designated representative means any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer who has been designated by the COTP to implement or enforce this section.</p><p class="depth2">Seattle Seafair Fleet Week means an annual event involving a parade of U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and foreign military ships in Seattle's Elliott Bay waterfront and tours of those ships while docked at Port of Seattle facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulations. Under 33 CFR Part 165, Subpart D, no person or vessel may enter or remain in the security zones described in paragraph (a) of this section without the permission of the COTP or a designated representative. The COTP has granted general permission for vessels to enter the outer 400

yards of the security zones as long as those vessels within the outer 400 yards of the security zones operate at the minimum speed necessary to maintain course unless required to maintain speed by the navigation rules. The COTP may be assisted by other federal, state or local agencies with the enforcement of the security zones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authorization. All vessel operators who desire to enter the inner 100 yards of the security zones or transit the outer 400 yards at greater than minimum speed necessary to maintain course must obtain permission from the COTP or a Designated Representative by contacting the on-scene Coast Guard patrol craft on VHF 13 or Ch 16. Requests must include the reason why movement within this area is necessary. Vessel operators granted permission to enter the security zones will be escorted by the on-scene Coast Guard patrol craft until they are outside of the security zones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual enforcement period. The security zones described in paragraph (a) of this section will be enforced during Seattle Seafair Fleet Week each year for a period of up to one week. The Seattle Seafair Fleet Week will occur sometime between July 25 and August 14. The annual Federal Register notice identifying the designated participating vessels will also identify the specific dates of the event for that year.
