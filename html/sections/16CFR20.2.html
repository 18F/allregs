                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to misrepresent the identity of the  rebuilder, remanufacturer, reconditioner, reliner or other reworker of  an industry product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the identity of the original manufacturer of an industry  product, or the identity of the manufacturer for which the product was  originally made, is revealed and the product was rebuilt,  remanufactured, reconditioned, relined, or otherwise reworked by someone  else, it is unfair or deceptive to fail to disclose such fact wherever  the original manufacturer is identified in advertising or promotional  literature concerning the industry product, on the container in which  the product is packed, and on the product itself, in close conjunction  with, and of the same permanency and conspicuousness as, the disclosure  that the product is not new. Examples of such disclosures include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of the identity of the rebuilder: ``Rebuilt by John  Doe Co.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt by an  independent rebuilder: ``Rebuilt by an Independent Rebuilder.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt by someone  other than the manufacturer identified: ``Rebuilt by other than XYZ  Motors.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt for the  identified manufacturer: ``Rebuilt for XYZ Motors.''</p>
