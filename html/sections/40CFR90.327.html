For sampling systems which use heated components, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system that has a separate source of power or heating element. Monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the surface temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If water is removed by condensation, monitor the sample gas temperature or sample dew point either within the water trap or downstream. It may not exceed 7 C.</p>
