                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After you stabilize the test engine's emission levels, you may do maintenance as allowed by the standard-setting part. However, you may not do any maintenance based on emission measurements from the test engine (i.e., unscheduled maintenance).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For any critical emission-related maintenance--other than what we specifically allow in the standard-setting part--you must completely test an engine for emissions before and after doing any maintenance that might affect emissions, unless we waive this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you inspect an engine, keep a record of the inspection and update your application to document any changes that result. You may use any kind of equipment, instrument, or tool to identify bad engine components or perform maintenance if it is available at dealerships and other service outlets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If we determine that a part failure, system malfunction, or associated repairs have made the engine's emission controls unrepresentative of production engines, you may no longer use it as an emission-data engine. Also, if your test engine has a major mechanical failure that requires you to take it apart, you may no longer use it as an emission-data engine.
