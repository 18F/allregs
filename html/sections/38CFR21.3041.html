                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility derived from a veteran with a P&T; disability. An eligible child's period of eligibility generally begins on the child's 18th birthday, or on the successful completion of the child's secondary schooling, whichever first occurs. The period of eligibility generally ends on the earlier of the date of the child's 26th birthday or the date the veteran is no longer P&T; disabled. VA will extend an eligible child's period of eligibility for the reasons listed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible child after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. If the veteran dies while the P&T; rating is in effect and before the eligible child's 26th birthday, see paragraph (b) of this section to determine the new period of eligibility. Exceptions to this general period of eligibility are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Period of eligibility may begin before the child's 18th birthday. The period of eligibility may begin before the eligible child's 18th birthday for one of the reasons in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The period of eligibility ends on the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled or the date of the child's 26th birthday. See Sec. 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The child completed compulsory school attendance under applicable State law (see Sec. 21.3040(a) and (b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The child is pursuing a course designed to prepare him or her for an examination required or used for entrance into an institution of higher education or a graduate school; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The child is beyond his or her 14th birthday and has a physical or mental handicap (see Sec. 21.3040(a)).

(Authority 38 U.S.C. 3512(a))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Period of eligibility may begin after the child's 18th birthday. A child's period of eligibility may begin after his or her 18th birthday if VA first finds the veteran has a P&T; disability after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday. See paragraph (e) of this section if an adopted child becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child after VA first finds the veteran has a P&T; disability. See paragraph (f) of this section if a stepchild becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child after VA first finds the veteran is P&T; disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Beginning date if the effective date of the initial P&T; rating is before the child's 18th birthday and notification to the veteran occurs after the child's 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. If the effective date of the P&T; rating is before the child's 18th birthday, and the date of notification to the veteran occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday, the child may elect the beginning date of his or her period of eligibility. (See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements.) If the child elects a beginning date that is before his or her 18th birthday, the period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date that the veteran is no longer rated

P&T; disabled, or the date of the child's 26th birthday. If the child elects a beginning date after his or her 18th birthday, the period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled or 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. (See Sec. 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled.) The child can elect as a beginning date either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of his or her 18th birthday;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date he or she completed compulsory school attendance under applicable State law (see Sec. 21.3040(a) and (b)), if that date is on or after the effective date of the P&T; rating and before his or her 18th birthday;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date he or she begins a course designed to prepare him or her for an examination required or used for entrance into an institution of higher education or a graduate school, if that date is on or after the effective date of the P&T; rating and before the date of notification to the veteran of the P&T; rating. If the child elects the beginning date of enrollment in such course, he or she may not receive educational assistance for pursuit of secondary schooling unless secondary school pursuit is otherwise authorized (see Sec. 21.3040);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date VA notifies the veteran of the P&T; rating; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any date between the applicable date described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section and the date in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning date if the effective date of the P&T; rating is after the child's 18th birthday and before child's 26th birthday. If the effective date of the P&T; rating occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday, the child may elect the beginning date of his or her period of eligibility. (See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements.) The period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled, or 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. (See Sec. 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T; disabled.) The child can elect as a beginning date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The effective date of the P&T; rating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date VA notifies the veteran of the veteran's P&T; rating; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any date in between.

The period of eligibility ends 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements. VA may extend the period of eligibility for one of the reasons shown in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves in the Armed Forces as an eligible person

after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. The child can elect as a beginning date any date between the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Date of the veteran's death; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date of VA's decision that the veteran's death was service-connected.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3512(a)(3))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Period of eligibility for a child who serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible person. If the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible person (as defined in Sec. 21.3021(a)(1)) after the child's 18th birthday and before the child's 26th birthday, the child is eligible for a modified ending date based on the provisions of this paragraph. Under the provisions of this paragraph, the period of eligibility ends 8 years after the date of the child's first discharge or release from such duty, or the child's 31st birthday, whichever is earlier. VA may extend the ending date for one of the reasons shown in paragraph (g) of this section. See paragraph (h) of this section if the child is ordered to active duty as a reservist.
