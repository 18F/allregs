(Stress Grade) construction grade lumber. All  dimensions are nominal sizes as provided in the American Lumber  Standards, except that where rough sizes are noted, only rough or  undressed lumber of the size specified will satisfy minimum  requirements.

Where the ends of planks abut each other to form a  flush floor, the butt joint shall be at the centerline of a pole. The  abutted ends shall rest on separate bearers. Intermediate beams shall be  provided where necessary to prevent dislodgment of planks due to  deflection, and the ends shall be nailed or cleated to prevent their  dislodgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> When a scaffold turns a corner, the platform planks shall be  laid to prevent tipping. The planks that meet the corner putlog at an  angle shall be laid first, extending over the diagonally placed putlog  far enough to have a good safe bearing, but not far enough to involve  any danger from tipping.
