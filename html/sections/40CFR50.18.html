The method is applicable to the measurement of ambient  SO2 concentrations using continuous (real-time) sampling.  Additional quality assurance procedures and guidance are provided in  part 58, appendix A, of this chapter and in Reference 3.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Principle</p><p class="depth0">2.1 This reference method is based on automated measurement of the  intensity of the characteristic fluorescence released by SO2  in an ambient air sample contained in a measurement cell of an analyzer  when the air sample is irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light passed  through the cell. The fluorescent light released by the SO2  is also in the ultraviolet region, but at longer wavelengths than the  excitation light. Typically, optimum instrumental measurement of  SO2 concentrations is obtained with an excitation wavelength  in a band between approximately 190 to 230 nm, and measurement of the  SO2 fluorescence in a broad band around 320 nm, but these  wavelengths are not necessarily constraints of this reference method.  Generally, the measurement system (analyzer) also requires means to  reduce the effects of aromatic hydrocarbon species, and possibly other  compounds, in the air sample to control measurement interferences from  these compounds, which may be present in the ambient air. References 1  and 2 describe UVF method.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The measurement system is calibrated by referencing the  instrumental fluorescence measurements to SO2 standard  concentrations traceable to a National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) primary standard for SO2 (see Calibration  Procedure below).</p><p class="depth0">2.3 An analyzer implementing this measurement principle is shown  schematically in Figure 1. Designs should include a measurement cell, a  UV light source of appropriate wavelength, a UV detector system with  appropriate wave length sensitivity, a pump and flow control system for  sampling the ambient air and moving it into the measurement cell, sample  air conditioning components as necessary to minimize measurement  interferences, suitable control and measurement processing capability,  and other apparatus as may be necessary. The analyzer must be designed  to provide accurate, repeatable, and continuous measurements of  SO2 concentrations in ambient air, with measurement  performance as specified in Subpart B of Part 53 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Sampling considerations: The use of a particle filter on the  sample inlet line of a UVF SO2 analyzer is required to  prevent interference, malfunction, or damage due to particles in the  sampled air.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The effects of the principal potential interferences may need to  be mitigated to meet the interference equivalent requirements of part 53  of this chapter. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and naphthalene  can fluoresce and act as strong positive interferences. These gases can  be removed by using a permeation type scrubber (hydrocarbon ``kicker'').  Nitrogen oxide (NO) in high concentrations can also fluoresce and cause  positive interference. Optical filtering can be employed to improve the  rejection of interference from high NO. Ozone can absorb UV light given  off by the SO2 molecule and cause a measurement offset. This  effect can be reduced by minimizing the measurement path length between  the area where SO2 fluorescence occurs and the  photomultiplier tube detector (e.g., <5 cm). A hydrocarbon scrubber,  optical filter and appropriate distancing of the measurement path length  may be required method components to reduce interference.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Calibration Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Atmospheres containing accurately known concentrations of sulfur  dioxide are prepared using a compressed gas transfer standard diluted  with accurately metered clean air flow rates.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Apparatus: Figure 2 shows a typical generic system suitable for  diluting a SO2 gas cylinder concentration standard with clean  air through a mixing chamber to produce the desired calibration  concentration standards. A valve may be used to conveniently divert the  SO2 from the sampling manifold to provide clean zero air at  the output manifold for zero adjustment. The system may be made up using  common laboratory components, or it may be a commercially manufactured  system. In either case, the principle components are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 SO2 standard gas flow control and measurement  devices (or a combined device) capable of regulating and maintaining the  standard gas flow rate constant to within 2  percent and measuring the gas flow rate accurate to within 2, properly calibrated to a NIST-traceable standard.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Dilution air flow control and measurement devices (or a  combined device) capable of regulating and maintaining the air flow rate  constant to within 2 percent and measuring the air  flow rate accurate to within 2, properly  calibrated to a NIST-traceable standard.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3 Mixing chamber, of an inert material such as glass and of  proper design to provide thorough mixing of pollutant gas and diluent  air streams.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.4 Sampling manifold, constructed of glass,  polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE Teflon \TM\), or other suitably inert  material and of sufficient diameter to insure a minimum pressure drop at  the analyzer connection, with a vent designed to insure a minimum over- pressure (relative to ambient air pressure) at the analyzer connection  and to prevent ambient air from entering the manifold.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.5 Standard gas pressure regulator, of clean stainless steel with  a stainless steel diaphragm, suitable for use with a high pressure  SO2 gas cylinder.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.6 Reagents</p><p class="depth0">4.1.6.1 SO2 gas concentration transfer standard having a  certified SO2 concentration of not less than 10 ppm, in  N2, traceable to a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM).</p><p class="depth0">4.1.6.2 Clean zero air, free of contaminants that could cause a  detectable response or a change in sensitivity of the analyzer. Since  ultraviolet fluorescence analyzers may be sensitive to aromatic  hydrocarbons and O2-to-N2 ratios, it is important  that the clean zero air contains less than 0.1 ppm aromatic hydrocarbons  and O2 and N2 percentages approximately the same  as in ambient air. A procedure for generating zero air is given in  reference 1.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Procedure</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Obtain a suitable calibration apparatus, such as the one shown  schematically in Figure 1, and verify that all materials in contact with  the pollutant are of glass, Teflon \TM\, or other suitably inert  material and completely clean.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Purge the SO2 standard gas lines and pressure  regulator to remove any residual air.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Ensure that there are no leaks in the system and that the flow  measuring devices are properly and accurately calibrated under the  conditions of use against a reliable volume or flow rate standard such  as a soap-bubble meter or a wet-test meter traceable to a NIST standard.  All volumetric flow rates should be corrected to the same reference  temperature and pressure by using the formula below: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN10.000     Where:  Fc = corrected flow rate (L/min at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg), Fm = measured flow rate, (at temperature, Tm and pressure,</p><p class="depth0">Pm), Pm = measured pressure in mm Hg, (absolute), and Tm = measured temperature in degrees Celsius.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 Allow the SO2 analyzer under calibration to sample  zero air until a stable response is obtained, then make the proper zero  adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.5 Adjust the airflow to provide an SO2 concentration  of approximately 80 percent of the upper measurement range limit of the  SO2 instrument and verify that the total air flow of the  calibration system exceeds the demand of all analyzers sampling from the  output manifold (with the excess vented).</p><p class="depth0">4.2.6 Calculate the actual SO2 calibration concentration  standard as: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JN10.001  Where:  C = the concentration of the SO2 gas standard Fp = the flow rate of SO2 gas standard Ft = the total air flow rate of pollutant and diluent gases</p><p class="depth0">4.2.7 When the analyzer response has stabilized, adjust the  SO2 span control to obtain the desired response equivalent to  the calculated standard concentration. If substantial adjustment of the  span control is needed, it may be necessary to re-check the zero and  span adjustments by repeating steps 4.2.4 through 4.2.7 until no further  adjustments are needed.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.8 Adjust the flow rate(s) to provide several other  SO2 calibration concentrations over the analyzer's  measurement range. At least five different concentrations evenly spaced  throughout the analyzer's range are suggested.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.9 Plot the analyzer response (vertical or Y-axis) versus  SO2 concentration (horizontal or X-axis). Compute the linear  regression slope and intercept and plot the regression line to verify  that no point deviates from this line by more than 2 percent of the  maximum concentration tested.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Additional information on calibration and pollutant standards  is provided in Section 12 of Reference 3.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Frequency of Calibration</p><p class="depth0">The frequency of calibration, as well as the number of points  necessary to establish the calibration curve and the frequency of other  performance checking will vary by analyzer; however, the minimum  frequency, acceptance criteria, and subsequent actions are specified in  Reference 3, Appendix D: Measurement Quality Objectives and Validation  Template for SO2 (page 9 of 30). The user's quality control  program should provide guidelines for initial establishment of these  variables and for subsequent alteration as operational experience is  accumulated. Manufacturers of analyzers should include in their  instruction/operation manuals information and guidance as to these  variables and on other matters of operation, calibration, routine  maintenance, and quality control.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 References for SO2 Method  1.

The method is applicable to the  measurement of ambient SO2 concentrations using sampling  periods ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours. Additional quality  assurance procedures and guidance are provided in part 58, appendixes A  and B, of this chapter and in references 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Principle.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A measured volume of air is bubbled through a solution of 0.04 M  potassium tetrachloromercurate (TCM). The SO2 present in the  air stream reacts with the TCM solution to form a stable  monochlorosulfonatomercurate(3) complex. Once formed, this complex  resists air oxidation(4, 5) and is stable in the presence of strong  oxidants such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen. During subsequent  analysis, the complex is reacted with acid-bleached pararosaniline dye  and formaldehyde to form an intensely colored pararosaniline methyl  sulfonic acid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The optical density of this species is determined  spectrophotometrically at 548 nm and is directly related to the amount  of SO2 collected. The total volume of air sampled, corrected  to EPA reference conditions (25 [deg]C, 760 mm Hg [101 kPa]), is  determined from the measured flow rate and the sampling time. The  concentration of SO2 in the ambient air is computed and  expressed in micrograms per standard cubic meter ([micro]g/std m\3\).</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Range.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The lower limit of detection of SO2 in 10 mL of TCM  is 0.75 [micro]g (based on collaborative   test results).(7) This represents a concentration of 25 [micro]g  SO2/m\3\ (0.01 ppm) in an air sample of 30 standard liters  (short-term sampling) and a concentration of 13 [micro]g SO2/ m\3\ (0.005 ppm) in an air sample of 288 standard liters (long-term  sampling). Concentrations less than 25 [micro]g SO2/m\3\ can  be measured by sampling larger volumes of ambient air; however, the  collection efficiency falls off rapidly at low concentrations.(8, 9)  Beer's law is adhered to up to 34 [micro]g of SO2 in 25 mL of  final solution. This upper limit of the analysis range represents a  concentration of 1,130 [micro]g SO2/m\3\ (0.43 ppm) in an air  sample of 30 standard liters and a concentration of 590 [micro]g  SO2/m\3\ (0.23 ppm) in an air sample of 288 standard liters.  Higher concentrations can be measured by collecting a smaller volume of  air, by increasing the volume of absorbing solution, or by diluting a  suitable portion of the collected sample with absorbing solution prior  to analysis.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The effects of the principal potential interferences have been  minimized or eliminated in the following manner: Nitrogen oxides by the  addition of sulfamic acid,(10, 11) heavy metals by the addition of  ethylenediamine tetracetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) and phosphoric  acid,(10, 12) and ozone by time delay.(10) Up to 60 [micro]g Fe (III),  22 [micro]g V (V), 10 [micro]g Cu (II), 10 [micro]g Mn (II), and 10  [micro]g Cr (III) in 10 mL absorbing reagent can be tolerated in the  procedure.(10) No significant interference has been encountered with 2.3  [micro]g NH3.(13)</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Precision and Accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The precision of the analysis is 4.6 percent (at the 95 percent  confidence level) based on the analysis of standard sulfite samples.(10)</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Collaborative test results (14) based on the analysis of  synthetic test atmospheres (SO2 in scrubbed air) using the  24-hour sampling procedure and the sulfite-TCM calibration procedure  show that:</p><p class="depth0">The replication error varies linearly with  concentration from 2.5 [micro]g/m\3\ at  concentrations of 100 [micro]g/m\3\ to 7 [micro]g/ m\3\ at concentrations of 400 [micro]g/m\3\.</p><p class="depth0">The day-to-day variability within an individual  laboratory (repeatability) varies linearly with concentration from  18.1 [micro]g/m\3\ at levels of 100 [micro]g/m\3\  to 50.9 [micro]g/m\3\ at levels of 400 [micro]g/ m\3\.</p><p class="depth0">The day-to-day variability between two or more  laboratories (reproducibility) varies linearly with concentration from  36.9 [micro]g/m\3\ at levels of 100 [micro]g/m\3\  to 103.5 [micro] g/m\3\ at levels of 400 [micro]g/ m\3\.</p><p class="depth0">The method has a concentration-dependent bias, which  becomes significant at the 95 percent confidence level at the high  concentration level.

(15) If kept at 5 [deg]C following the completion of sampling, the  collected sample has been found to be stable for up to 30 days. (10) The  presence of EDTA enhances the stability of SO2 in the TCM  solution and the rate of decay is independent of the concentration of  SO2. (16)</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Sampling.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 Sample probe: A sample probe meeting the requirements of  section 7 of 40 CFR part 58, appendix E (Teflon [supreg] or glass with  residence time less than 20 sec.) is used to transport ambient air to  the sampling train location. The end of the probe should be designed or  oriented to preclude the sampling of precipitation, large particles,  etc. A suitable probe can be constructed from Teflon [supreg] tubing  connected to an inverted funnel.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2 Absorber--short-term sampling: An all glass midget impinger  having a solution capacity of 30 mL and a stem clearance of 4 1 mm from the bottom of the vessel is used for sampling  periods of 30 minutes and 1 hour (or any period considerably less than  24 hours). Such an impinger is shown in Figure 1. These impingers are  commercially available from distributors such as Ace Glass,  Incorporated.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.3 Absorber--24-hour sampling: A polypropylene tube 32 mm in  diameter and 164 mm long (available from Bel Art Products, Pequammock,  NJ) is used as the absorber. The cap of the absorber must be a  polypropylene cap with two ports (rubber stoppers are unacceptable  because the absorbing reagent can react with the stopper to yield  erroneously high SO2 concentrations). A glass impinger stem,  6 mm in diameter and 158 mm long, is inserted into one port of the  absorber cap. The tip of the stem is tapered to a small diameter orifice  (0.4 0.1 mm) such that a No. 79 jeweler's drill  bit will pass through the opening but a No. 78 drill bit will not.  Clearance from the bottom of the absorber to the tip of the stem must be  6 2 mm. Glass stems can be fabricated by any  reputable glass blower or can be obtained from a scientific supply firm.  Upon receipt, the orifice test should be performed to verify the orifice  size. The 50 mL volume level should be permanently marked on the  absorber. The assembled absorber is shown in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.4 Moisture trap: A moisture trap constructed of a glass trap as  shown in Figure 1 or a polypropylene tube as shown in Figure 2 is placed  between the absorber tube and flow control device to prevent entrained  liquid from reaching the flow control device. The tube is packed with  indicating silica gel as shown in Figure 2. Glass wool may be  substituted for silica gel when collecting short-term samples (1 hour or  less) as shown in   Figure 1, or for long term (24 hour) samples if flow changes are not  routinely encountered.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.5 Cap seals: The absorber and moisture trap caps must seal  securely to prevent leaks during use. Heat-shrink material as shown in  Figure 2 can be used to retain the cap seals if there is any chance of  the caps coming loose during sampling, shipment, or storage.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.6 Flow control device: A calibrated rotameter and needle valve  combination capable of maintaining and measuring air flow to within  2 percent is suitable for short-term sampling but  may not be used for long-term sampling. A critical orifice can be used  for regulating flow rate for both long-term and short-term sampling. A  22-gauge hypodermic needle 25 mm long may be used as a critical orifice  to yield a flow rate of approximately 1 L/min for a 30-minute sampling  period. When sampling for 1 hour, a 23-gauge hypodermic needle 16 mm in  length will provide a flow rate of approximately 0.5 L/min. Flow control  for a 24-hour sample may be provided by a 27-gauge hypodermic needle  critical orifice that is 9.5 mm in length. The flow rate should be in  the range of 0.18 to 0.22 L/min.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.7 Flow measurement device: Device calibrated as specified in  9.4.1 and used to measure sample flow rate at the monitoring site.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.8 Membrane particle filter: A membrane filter of 0.8 to 2  [micro]m porosity is used to protect the flow controller from particles  during long-term sampling. This item is optional for short-term  sampling.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.9 Vacuum pump: A vacuum pump equipped with a vacuum gauge and  capable of maintaining at least 70 kPa (0.7 atm) vacuum differential  across the flow control device at the specified flow rate is required  for sampling.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.10 Temperature control device: The temperature of the absorbing  solution during sampling must be maintained at 15[deg] 10 [deg]C. As soon as possible following sampling and  until analysis, the temperature of the collected sample must be  maintained at 5[deg] 5 [deg]C. Where an extended  period of time may elapse before the collected sample can be moved to  the lower storage temperature, a collection temperature near the lower  limit of the 15 10 [deg]C range should be used to  minimize losses during this period. Thermoelectric coolers specifically  designed for this temperature control are available commercially and  normally operate in the range of 5[deg] to 15 [deg]C. Small  refrigerators can be modified to provide the required temperature  control; however, inlet lines must be insulated from the lower  temperatures to prevent condensation when sampling under humid  conditions. A small heating pad may be necessary when sampling at low  temperatures (<7 [deg]C) to prevent the absorbing solution from  freezing.(17)</p><p class="depth0">7.1.11 Sampling train container: The absorbing solution must be  shielded from light during and after sampling. Most commercially  available sampler trains are enclosed in a light-proof box.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.12 Timer: A timer is recommended to initiate and to stop  sampling for the 24-hour period. The timer is not a required piece of  equipment; however, without the timer a technician would be required to  start and stop the sampling manually. An elapsed time meter is also  recommended to determine the duration of the sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Shipping.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Shipping container: A shipping container that can maintain a  temperature of 5[deg] 5 [deg]C is used for  transporting the sample from the collection site to the analytical  laboratory. Ice coolers or refrigerated shipping containers have been  found to be satisfactory. The use of eutectic cold packs instead of ice  will give a more stable temperature control. Such equipment is available  from Cole-Parmer Company, 7425 North Oak Park Avenue, Chicago, IL 60648.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Spectrophotometer: A spectrophotometer suitable for  measurement of absorbances at 548 nm with an effective spectral  bandwidth of less than 15 nm is required for analysis. If the  spectrophotometer reads out in transmittance, convert to absorbance as  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08NO91.000  where:  A = absorbance, and T = transmittance (0<=T<1).</p><p class="depth0">A standard wavelength filter traceable to the National Bureau of  Standards is used to verify the wavelength calibration according to the  procedure enclosed with the filter. The wavelength calibration must be  verified upon initial receipt of the instrument and after each 160 hours  of normal use or every 6 months, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Spectrophotometer cells: A set of 1-cm path length cells  suitable for use in the visible region is used during analysis. If the  cells are unmatched, a matching correction factor must be determined  according to Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.3 Temperature control device: The color development step during  analysis must be conducted in an environment that is in the range of  20[deg] to 30 [deg]C and controlled to 1 [deg]C.  Both calibration and sample analysis must be performed under identical  conditions (within 1 [deg]C). Adequate temperature control may be  obtained by means of constant temperature baths, water baths with manual  temperature control, or temperature controlled rooms.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.4 Glassware: Class A volumetric glassware of various capacities  is required for preparing and standardizing reagents and standards and  for dispensing solutions during analysis. These included pipets,  volumetric flasks, and burets.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.5 TCM waste receptacle: A glass waste receptacle is required for  the storage of spent TCM solution. This vessel should be stoppered and  stored in a hood at all times.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Reagents.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Sampling.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 Distilled water: Purity of distilled water must be verified by  the following procedure:(18)</p><p class="depth0">Place 0.20 mL of potassium permanganate solution  (0.316 g/L), 500 mL of distilled water, and 1mL of concentrated sulfuric  acid in a chemically resistant glass bottle, stopper the bottle, and  allow to stand.</p><p class="depth0">If the permanganate color (pink) does not disappear  completely after a period of 1 hour at room temperature, the water is  suitable for use.</p><p class="depth0">If the permanganate color does disappear, the water  can be purified by redistilling with one crystal each of barium  hydroxide and potassium permanganate in an all glass still.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 Absorbing reagent (0.04 M potassium tetrachloromercurate  [TCM]): Dissolve 10.86 g mercuric chloride, 0.066 g EDTA, and 6.0 g  potassium chloride in distilled water and dilute to volume with  distilled water in a 1,000-mL volumetric flask. (Caution: Mercuric  chloride is highly poisonous. If spilled on skin, flush with water  immediately.) The pH of this reagent should be between 3.0 and 5.0 (10)  Check the pH of the absorbing solution by using pH indicating paper or a  pH meter. If the pH of the solution is not between 3.0 and 5.0, dispose  of the solution according to one of the disposal techniques described in  Section 13.0. The absorbing reagent is normally stable for 6 months. If  a precipitate forms, dispose of the reagent according to one of the  procedures described in Section 13.0.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Sulfamic acid (0.6%): Dissolve 0.6 g sulfamic acid in 100 mL  distilled water.

Procedures are described for short-term  sampling (30-minute and 1-hour) and for long-term sampling (24-hour).  Different combinations of absorbing reagent volume, sampling rate, and  sampling time can be selected to meet special needs. For combinations  other than those specifically described, the conditions must be adjusted  so that linearity is maintained between absorbance and concentration  over the dynamic range. Absorbing reagent volumes less than 10 mL are  not recommended. The collection efficiency is above 98 percent for the  conditions described; however, the efficiency may be substantially lower  when sampling concentrations below 25 [micro][gamma]SO2/ m\3\.(8,9)</p><p class="depth0">9.2 30-Minute and 1-Hour Sampling. Place 10 mL of TCM absorbing  reagent in a midget impinger and seal the impinger with a thin film of  silicon stopcock grease (around the ground glass joint). Insert the  sealed impinger into the sampling train as shown in Figure 1, making  sure that all connections between the various components are leak tight.  Greaseless ball joint fittings, heat shrinkable Teflon [supreg] tubing,  or Teflon [supreg] tube fittings may be used to attain leakfree  conditions for portions of the sampling train that come into contact  with air containing SO2. Shield the absorbing reagent from  direct sunlight by covering the impinger with aluminum foil or by  enclosing the sampling train in a light-proof box. Determine the flow  rate according to Section 9.4.2. Collect the sample at 1 0.10 L/min for 30-minute sampling or 0.500 0.05 L/min for 1-hour sampling. Record the exact  sampling time in minutes, as the sample volume will later be determined  using the sampling flow rate and the sampling time. Record the  atmospheric pressure and temperature.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 24-Hour Sampling. Place 50 mL of TCM absorbing solution in a  large absorber, close the cap, and, if needed, apply the heat shrink  material as shown in Figure 3. Verify that the reagent level is at the  50 mL mark on the absorber. Insert the sealed absorber into the sampling  train as shown in Figure 2. At this time verify that the absorber  temperature is controlled to 15 10 [deg]C. During  sampling, the absorber temperature must be controlled to prevent  decomposition of the collected complex. From the onset of sampling until  analysis, the absorbing solution must be protected from direct sunlight.  Determine the flow rate according to Section 9.4.2. Collect the sample  for 24 hours from midnight to midnight at a flow rate of 0.200 0.020 L/min. A start/stop timer is helpful for  initiating and stopping sampling and an elapsed time meter will be  useful for determining the sampling time.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Flow Measurement.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.1 Calibration: Flow measuring devices used for the on-site flow  measurements required in 9.4.2 must be calibrated against a reliable  flow or volume standard such as an NBS traceable bubble flowmeter or  calibrated wet test meter. Rotameters or critical orifices used in the  sampling train may be calibrated, if desired, as a quality control  check, but such calibration shall not replace the on-site flow  measurements required by 9.4.2. In-line rotameters, if they are to be  calibrated, should be calibrated in situ, with the appropriate volume of  solution in the absorber.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.2 Determination of flow rate at sampling site: For short-term  samples, the standard flow rate is determined at the sampling site at  the initiation and completion of sample collection with a calibrated  flow measuring device connected to the inlet of the absorber. For 24- hour samples, the standard flow rate is determined at the time the  absorber is placed in the sampling train and again when the absorber is  removed from the train for shipment to the analytical laboratory with a  calibrated flow measuring device connected to the inlet of the sampling  train. The flow rate determination must be made with all components of  the sampling system in operation (e.g., the absorber temperature  controller and any sample box heaters must also be operating). Equation  6 may be used to determine the standard flow rate when a calibrated  positive displacement meter is used as the flow measuring device. Other  types of calibrated flow measuring devices may also be used to determine  the flow rate at the sampling site provided that the user applies any  appropriate corrections to devices for which output is dependent on  temperature or pressure.

Start a  laboratory timer that has been set for 30 minutes. Bring all flasks to  volume with recently boiled and cooled distilled water and mix  thoroughly. The color must be developed (during the 30-minute period) in  a temperature environment in the range of 20[deg] to 30 [deg]C, which is  controlled to 1 [deg]C. For increased precision, a  constant temperature bath is recommended during the color development  step. After 30 minutes, determine the corrected absorbance of each  standard at 548 nm against a distilled water reference (Section 10.1).  Denote this absorbance as (A). Distilled water is used in the reference  cell rather than the reagant blank because of the temperature  sensitivity of the reagent blank.

The total micrograms SO2  contained in each solution is the x variable, and the corrected  absorbance (eq. 10) associated with each solution is the y variable. For  the calibration to be valid, the slope must be in the range of 0.030  0.002 absorbance unit/[micro]g SO2, the  intercept as determined by the least squares method must be equal to or  less than 0.170 absorbance unit when the color is developed at 22 [deg]C  (add 0.015 to this 0.170 specification for each [deg]C above 22 [deg]C)  and the correlation coefficient must be greater than 0.998. If these  criteria are not met, it may be the result of an impure dye and/or an  improperly standardized sulfite-TCM solution. A calibration factor  (Bs) is determined by calculating the reciprocal of the slope  and is subsequently used for calculating the sample concentration  (Section 12.3).</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Dynamic Calibration Procedures (Option 2). Atmospheres  containing accurately known concentrations of sulfur dioxide are  prepared using permeation devices. In the systems for generating these  atmospheres, the permeation device emits gaseous SO2 at a  known, low, constant rate, provided the temperature of the device is  held constant (0.1 [deg]C) and the device has been  accurately calibrated at the temperature of use. The SO2  permeating from the device is carried by a low flow of dry carrier gas  to a mixing chamber where it is diluted with SO2-free air to  the desired concentration and supplied to a vented manifold. A typical  system is shown schematically in Figure 4 and this system and other  similar systems have been described in detail by O'Keeffe and Ortman;  (19) Scaringelli, Frey, and Saltzman, (20) and Scaringelli, O'Keeffe,  Rosenberg, and Bell. (21) Permeation devices may be prepared or  purchased and in both cases must be traceable either to a National  Bureau of Standards (NBS) Standard Reference Material (SRM 1625, SRM  1626, SRM 1627) or to an NBS/EPA-approved commercially available  Certified Reference Material (CRM). CRM's are described in Reference 22,  and a list of CRM sources is available from the address shown for  Reference 22. A recommended protocol for certifying a permeation device  to an NBS SRM or CRM is given in Section 2.0.7 of Reference 2. Device  permeation rates of 0.2 to 0.4 [micro]g/min, inert gas flows of about 50  mL/min, and dilution air flow rates from 1.1 to 15 L/min conveniently  yield standard atmospheres in the range of 25 to 600 [micro]g  SO2/m\3\ (0.010 to 0.230 ppm).</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 Calibration Option 2A (30-minute and 1-hour samples):  Generate a series of six standard atmospheres of SO2 (e.g.,  0, 50, 100, 200, 350, 500, 750 [micro]g/m\3\) by adjusting the dilution  flow rates appropriately.

Due to the length of the sampling periods required, this  method is not recommended for 24-hour sampling. At the completion of  sampling, quantitatively transfer the contents of each impinger to one  of a series of 25-mL volumetric flasks (if 10 mL of absorbing solution  was used) using small amounts of distilled water for rinse (<5mL).

If either the temperature is above 10 [deg]C or there was significant  loss (more than 10 mL) of the sample during shipping, make an  appropriate notation in the record and invalidate the sample. Prepare  the samples for analysis as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. For 30-minute or 1-hour samples: Quantitatively transfer the  entire 10 mL amount of absorbing solution to a 25-mL volumetric flask  and rinse with a small amount (<5 mL) of distilled water.</p><p class="depth0">2. For 24-hour samples: If the volume of the sample is less than the  original 50-mL volume (permanent mark on the absorber), adjust the  volume back to the original volume with distilled water to compensate  for water lost to evaporation during sampling. If the final volume is  greater than the original volume, the volume must be measured using a  graduated cylinder. To analyze, pipet 10 mL   of the solution into a 25-mL volumetric flask.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Sample Analysis. For each set of determinations, prepare a  reagent blank by adding 10 mL TCM absorbing solution to a 25-mL  volumetric flask, and two control standards containing approximately 5  and 15 [micro]g SO2, respectively. The control standards are  prepared according to Section 10.2 or 10.3. The analysis is carried out  as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Allow the sample to stand 20 minutes after the completion of  sampling to allow any ozone to decompose (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">2. To each 25-mL volumetric flask containing reagent blank, sample,  or control standard, add 1 mL of 0.6% sulfamic acid (Section 8.2.1) and  allow to react for 10 min.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accurately pipet 2 mL of 0.2% formaldehyde solution (Section  8.2.2) and then 5 mL of pararosaniline solution (Section 8.2.13) into  each flask. Start a laboratory timer set at 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Bring each flask to volume with recently boiled and cooled  distilled water and mix thoroughly.</p><p class="depth0">5. During the 30 minutes, the solutions must be in a temperature  controlled environment in the range of 20[deg] to 30 [deg]C maintained  to 1 [deg]C. This temperature must also be within  1 [deg]C of that used during calibration.</p><p class="depth0">6. After 30 minutes and before 60 minutes, determine the corrected  absorbances (equation 10) of each solution at 548 nm using 1-cm optical  path length cells against a distilled water reference (Section 10.1).  (Distilled water is used as a reference instead of the reagent blank  because of the sensitivity of the reagent blank to temperature.)</p><p class="depth0">7. Do not allow the colored solution to stand in the cells because a  film may be deposited. Clean the cells with isopropyl alcohol after use.</p><p class="depth0">8. The reagent blank must be within 0.03 absorbance units of the  intercept of the calibration equation determined in Section 10.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Absorbance range. If the absorbance of the sample solution  ranges between 1.0 and 2.0, the sample can be diluted 1:1 with a portion  of the reagent blank and the absorbance redetermined within 5 minutes.  Solutions with higher absorbances can be diluted up to sixfold with the  reagent blank in order to obtain scale readings of less than 1.0  absorbance unit. However, it is recommended that a smaller portion (<10  mL) of the original sample be reanalyzed (if possible) if the sample  requires a dilution greater than 1:1.</p><p class="depth0">11.4 Reagent disposal. All reagents containing mercury compounds  must be stored and disposed of using one of the procedures contained in  Section 13.

Appendix B to Part 50--Reference Method for the Determination of</p><p class="depth0">Suspended Particulate Matter in the Atmosphere (High-Volume Method)</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Applicability.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method provides a measurement of the mass concentration of  total suspended particulate matter (TSP) in ambient air for determining  compliance with the primary and secondary national ambient air quality  standards for particulate matter as specified in Sec. 50.6 and Sec.  50.7 of this chapter. The measurement process is nondestructive, and the  size of the sample collected is usually adequate for subsequent chemical  analysis. Quality assurance procedures and guidance are provided in part  58, appendixes A and B, of this chapter and in References 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Principle.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An air sampler, properly located at the measurement site, draws  a measured quantity of ambient air into a covered housing and through a  filter during a 24-hr (nominal) sampling period. The sampler flow rate  and the geometry of the shelter favor the collection of particles up to  25-50 [micro]m (aerodynamic diameter), depending on wind speed and  direction.(3) The filters used are specified to have a minimum  collection efficiency of 99 percent for 0.3 [micro]m (DOP) particles  (see Section 7.1.4).</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The filter is weighed (after moisture equilibration) before and  after use to determine the net weight (mass) gain. The total volume of  air sampled, corrected to EPA standard conditions (25 [deg]C, 760 mm Hg  [101 kPa]), is determined from the measured flow rate and the sampling  time. The concentration of total suspended particulate matter in the  ambient air is computed as the mass of collected particles divided by  the volume of air sampled, corrected to standard conditions, and is  expressed in micrograms per standard cubic meter ([micro]g/std m\3\).  For samples collected at temperatures and pressures significantly  different than standard conditions, these corrected concentrations may  differ substantially from actual concentrations (micrograms per actual  cubic meter), particularly at high elevations. The actual particulate  matter concentration can be calculated from the corrected concentration  using the actual temperature and pressure during the sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Range.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The approximate concentration range of the method is 2 to 750  [micro]g/std m\3\. The upper limit is determined by the point at which  the   sampler can no longer maintain the specified flow rate due to the  increased pressure drop of the loaded filter. This point is affected by  particle size distribution, moisture content of the collected particles,  and variability from filter to filter, among other things. The lower  limit is determined by the sensitivity of the balance (see Section 7.10)  and by inherent sources of error (see Section 6).</p><p class="depth0">3.2 At wind speeds between 1.3 and 4.5 m/sec (3 and 10 mph), the  high-volume air sampler has been found to collect particles up to 25 to  50 [micro]m, depending on wind speed and direction.(3) For the filter  specified in Section 7.1, there is effectively no lower limit on the  particle size collected.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Precision.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Based upon collaborative testing, the relative standard  deviation (coefficient of variation) for single analyst precision  (repeatability) of the method is 3.0 percent. The corresponding value  for interlaboratory precision (reproducibility) is 3.7 percent.(4)</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The absolute accuracy of the method is undefined because of the  complex nature of atmospheric particulate matter and the difficulty in  determining the ``true'' particulate matter concentration. This method  provides a measure of particulate matter concentration suitable for the  purpose specified under Section 1.0, Applicability.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Inherent Sources of Error.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Airflow variation. The weight of material collected on the  filter represents the (integrated) sum of the product of the  instantaneous flow rate times the instantaneous particle concentration.  Therefore, dividing this weight by the average flow rate over the  sampling period yields the true particulate matter concentration only  when the flow rate is constant over the period. The error resulting from  a nonconstant flow rate depends on the magnitude of the instantaneous  changes in the flow rate and in the particulate matter concentration.  Normally, such errors are not large, but they can be greatly reduced by  equipping the sampler with an automatic flow controlling mechanism that  maintains constant flow during the sampling period. Use of a contant  flow controller is recommended.* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">*At elevated altitudes, the effectiveness of automatic flow  controllers may be reduced because of a reduction in the maximum sampler  flow. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Air volume measurement. If the flow rate changes substantially  or nonuniformly during the sampling period, appreciable error in the  estimated air volume may result from using the average of the  presampling and postsampling flow rates. Greater air volume measurement  accuracy may be achieved by (1) equipping the sampler with a flow  controlling mechanism that maintains constant air flow during the  sampling period,* (2) using a calibrated, continuous flow rate recording  device to record the actual flow rate during the samping period and  integrating the flow rate over the period, or (3) any other means that  will accurately measure the total air volume sampled during the sampling  period. Use of a continuous flow recorder is recommended, particularly  if the sampler is not equipped with a constant flow controller.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Loss of volatiles. Volatile particles collected on the filter  may be lost during subsequent sampling or during shipment and/or storage  of the filter prior to the postsampling weighing.(5) Although such  losses are largely unavoidable, the filter should be reweighed as soon  after sampling as practical.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Artifact particulate matter. Artifact particulate matter can be  formed on the surface of alkaline glass fiber filters by oxidation of  acid gases in the sample air, resulting in a higher than true TSP  determination.(6 7) This effect usually occurs early in the sample  period and is a function of the filter pH and the presence of acid  gases. It is generally believed to account for only a small percentage  of the filter weight gain, but the effect may become more significant  where relatively small particulate weights are collected.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Humidity. Glass fiber filters are comparatively insensitive to  changes in relative humidity, but collected particulate matter can be  hygroscopic.(8) The moisture conditioning procedure minimizes but may  not completely eliminate error due to moisture.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Filter handling. Careful handling of the filter between the  presampling and postsampling weighings is necessary to avoid errors due  to loss of fibers or particles from the filter. A filter paper cartridge  or cassette used to protect the filter can minimize handling errors.  (See Reference 2, Section 2).</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Nonsampled particulate matter. Particulate matter may be  deposited on the filter by wind during periods when the sampler is  inoperative. (9) It is recommended that errors from this source be  minimized by an automatic mechanical device that keeps the filter  covered during nonsampling periods, or by timely installation and  retrieval of filters to minimize the nonsampling periods prior to and  following operation.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Timing errors. Samplers are normally controlled by clock timers  set to start and stop the sampler at midnight. Errors in the nominal  1,440-min sampling period may result from a power interruption during  the sampling period or from a discrepancy between the start or stop time  recorded on the filter information record and the actual start or stop  time of the sampler. Such discrepancies may be caused by (1) poor  resolution of the timer set-points, (2) timer error due to power  interruption, (3) missetting of   the timer, or (4) timer malfunction. In general, digital electronic  timers have much better set-point resolution than mechanical timers, but  require a battery backup system to maintain continuity of operation  after a power interruption. A continuous flow recorder or elapsed time  meter provides an indication of the sampler run-time, as well as  indication of any power interruption during the sampling period and is  therefore recommended.</p><p class="depth0">6.9 Recirculation of sampler exhaust. Under stagnant wind  conditions, sampler exhaust air can be resampled. This effect does not  appear to affect the TSP measurement substantially, but may result in  increased carbon and copper in the collected sample. (10) This problem  can be reduced by ducting the exhaust air well away, preferably  downwind, from the sampler.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">(See References 1 and 2 for quality assurance information.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: Samplers purchased prior to the effective date of this  amendment are not subject to specifications preceded by ([dagger]).</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Filter.

Other types of flow indicators (including rotameters) having  comparable precision and accuracy are also acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 [dagger] The flow rate measurement device must be capable of  being calibrated and read in units corresponding to a flow rate which is  readable to the nearest 0.02 std m\3\/min over the range 1.0 to 1.8 std  m\3\/min.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Thermometer, to indicate the approximate air temperature at the  flow rate measurement orifice, when temperature corrections are used.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 Range: -40[deg] to +50 [deg]C (223-323 K).</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 Resolution: 2 [deg]C (2 K).</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Barometer, to indicate barometric pressure at the flow rate  measurement orifice, when pressure corrections are used.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.1 Range: 500 to 800 mm Hg (66-106 kPa).</p><p class="depth0">7.6.2 Resolution: 5 mm Hg (0.67 kPa).</p><p class="depth0">7.7 Timing/control device.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.1 The timing device must be capable of starting and stopping the  sampler to obtain an elapsed run-time of 24 hr 1  hr (1,440 60 min).</p><p class="depth0">7.7.2 Accuracy of time setting: 30 min, or  better.

Where Pa and Ta can be determined for  a site for a seasonal period such that the actual barometric pressure  and temperature at the site do not vary by more than 60 mm Hg (8 kPa) from Pa or 15 [deg]C from Ta, respectively, then using  Pa and Ta avoids the need for subsequent pressure  and temperature calculation when the sampler is used. The geographic  average barometric pressure (Pa) may be estimated from an  altitude-pressure table or by making an (approximate) elevation  correction of -26 mm Hg (-3.46 kPa) for each 305 m (1,000 ft) above sea  level (760 mm Hg or 101 kPa).

The method is applicable to  continuous sampling and measurement of ambient CO concentrations  suitable for determining 1-hour or longer average measurements. The  method may also provide measurements of shorter averaging times, subject  to specific analyzer performance limitations. Additional CO monitoring  quality assurance procedures and guidance   are provided in part 58, appendix A, of this chapter and in reference 1  of this appendix C.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Measurement Principle</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Measurements of CO in ambient air are based on automated  measurement of the absorption of infrared radiation by CO in an ambient  air sample drawn into an analyzer employing non-wavelength-dispersive,  infrared photometry (NDIR method). Infrared energy from a source in the  photometer is passed through a cell containing the air sample to be  analyzed, and the quantitative absorption of energy by CO in the sample  cell is measured by a suitable detector. The photometer is sensitized  specifically to CO by employing CO gas in a filter cell in the optical  path, which, when compared to a differential optical path without a CO  filter cell, limits the measured absorption to one or more of the  characteristic wavelengths at which CO strongly absorbs. However, to  meet measurement performance requirements, various optical filters,  reference cells, rotating gas filter cells, dual-beam configurations,  moisture traps, or other means may also be used to further enhance  sensitivity and stability of the photometer and to minimize potential  measurement interference from water vapor, carbon dioxide  (CO2), or other species. Also, various schemes may be used to  provide a suitable zero reference for the photometer, and optional  automatic compensation may be provided for the actual pressure and  temperature of the air sample in the measurement cell. The measured  infrared absorption, converted to a digital reading or an electrical  output signal, indicates the measured CO concentration.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The measurement system is calibrated by referencing the  analyzer's CO measurements to CO concentration standards traceable to a  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) primary standard  for CO, as described in the associated calibration procedure specified  in section 4 of this reference method.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 An analyzer implementing this measurement principle will be  considered a reference method only if it has been designated as a  reference method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Sampling considerations.

In either  case, the principal components are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 CO standard gas flow control and measurement devices (or a  combined device) capable of regulating and maintaining the standard gas  flow rate constant to within 2 percent and  measuring the gas flow rate accurate to within 2  percent, properly calibrated to a NIST-traceable standard.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 For the dilution method (Figure 1), dilution air flow control  and measurement devices (or a combined device) capable of regulating and  maintaining the air flow rate constant to within 2  percent and measuring the air flow rate accurate to within 2 percent, properly calibrated to a NIST-traceable  standard.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Standard gas pressure regulator(s) for the standard CO  cylinder(s), suitable for use with a high-pressure CO gas cylinder and  having a non-reactive diaphragm and internal parts and a suitable  delivery pressure.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 Mixing chamber for the dilution method of an inert material  and of proper design to provide thorough mixing of CO standard gas and  diluent air streams.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.5 Output sampling manifold, constructed of an inert material and  of sufficient diameter to ensure an insignificant pressure drop at the  analyzer connection.

If the CO analyzer has significant sensitivity to  CO2, the CO standard(s) should also contain 350 to 400 ppm  CO2 to replicate the typical CO2 concentration in  ambient air. However, if the zero air dilution ratio used for the  dilution method is not less than 100:1 and the zero air contains ambient  levels of CO2, then the CO standard may be contained in  nitrogen and need not contain CO2.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2 For the dilution method, clean zero air, free of contaminants  that could cause a detectable response on or a change in sensitivity of  the CO analyzer. The zero air should contain <0.1 ppm CO.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Procedure Using the Dilution Method</p><p class="depth0">4.4.1 Assemble or obtain a suitable dynamic dilution calibration  system such as the one shown schematically in Figure 1. Generally, all  calibration gases including zero air must be introduced into the sample  inlet of the analyzer. However, if the analyzer has special, approved  zero and span inlets and automatic valves to specifically allow  introduction of calibration standards at near atmospheric pressure, such  inlets may be used for calibration in lieu of the sample inlet. For  specific operating instructions, refer to the manufacturer's manual.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.2 Ensure that there are no leaks in the calibration system and  that all flowmeters are properly and accurately calibrated, under the  conditions of use, if appropriate, against a reliable volume or flow  rate standard such as a soap-bubble meter or wet-test meter traceable to  a NIST standard. All volumetric flow rates should be corrected to the  same temperature and pressure such as 298.15 K (25 [deg]C) and 760 mm Hg  (101 kPa), using a correction formula such as the following: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU11.001  Where:  Fc = corrected flow rate (L/min at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg), Fm = measured flow rate (at temperature Tm and pressure Pm), Pm = measured pressure in mm Hg (absolute), and Tm = measured temperature in degrees Celsius.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3 Select the operating range of the CO analyzer to be  calibrated. Connect the measurement signal output of the analyzer to an  appropriate readout instrument to allow the analyzer's measurement  output to be continuously monitored during the calibration. Where  possible, this readout instrument should be the same one used to record  routine monitoring data, or, at least, an instrument that is as closely  representative of that system as feasible.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4 Connect the inlet of the CO analyzer to the output-sampling  manifold of the calibration system.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.5 Adjust the calibration system to deliver zero air to the  output manifold. The total air flow must exceed the total demand of the  analyzer(s) connected to the output manifold to ensure that no ambient  air is pulled into the manifold vent. Allow the analyzer to sample zero  air until a stable response is obtained. After the response has  stabilized, adjust the analyzer zero reading.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.6 Adjust the zero air flow rate and the CO gas flow rate from  the standard CO cylinder to provide a diluted CO concentration of  approximately 80 percent of the measurement upper range limit (URL) of  the operating range of the analyzer. The total air flow rate must exceed  the total demand of the analyzer(s) connected to the output manifold to  ensure that no ambient air is pulled into the manifold vent. The exact  CO concentration is calculated from: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU11.002  Where:  [CO]OUT = diluted CO concentration at the output manifold (ppm), [CO]STD = concentration of the undiluted CO standard (ppm),   FCO = flow rate of the CO standard (L/min), and FD = flow rate of the dilution air (L/min).  Sample this CO concentration until a stable response is obtained. Adjust  the analyzer span control to obtain the desired analyzer response  reading equivalent to the calculated standard concentration. If  substantial adjustment of the analyzer span control is required, it may  be necessary to recheck the zero and span adjustments by repeating steps  4.4.5 and 4.4.6. Record the CO concentration and the analyzer's final  response.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.7 Generate several additional concentrations (at least three  evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested to verify  linearity) by decreasing FCO or increasing FD. Be sure the total flow  exceeds the analyzer's total flow demand. For each concentration  generated, calculate the exact CO concentration using equation (2).  Record the concentration and the analyzer's stable response for each  concentration. Plot the analyzer responses (vertical or y-axis) versus  the corresponding CO concentrations (horizontal or x-axis). Calculate  the linear regression slope and intercept of the calibration curve and  verify that no point deviates from this line by more than 2 percent of  the highest concentration tested.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Procedure Using the Multiple-Cylinder Method.

The frequency of calibration, as well  as the number of points necessary to establish the calibration curve and  the frequency of other performance checking, will vary by analyzer.  However, the minimum frequency, acceptance criteria, and subsequent  actions are specified in reference 1, appendix D, ``Measurement Quality  Objectives and Validation Template for CO'' (page 5 of 30). The user's  quality control program should provide guidelines for initial  establishment of these variables and for subsequent alteration as  operational experience is accumulated. Manufacturers of CO analyzers  should include in their instruction/operation manuals information and  guidance as to these variables and on other matters of operation,  calibration, routine maintenance, and quality control.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Reference</p><p class="depth0">1.

Ambient air and ethylene are delivered simultaneously to a mixing  zone where the ozone in the air reacts with the ethylene to emit light,  which is detected by a photomultiplier tube. The resulting photocurrent  is amplified and is either read directly or displayed on a recorder.</p><p class="depth0">2. An analyzer based on this principle will be considered a  reference method only if it has been designated as a reference method in  accordance with part 53 of this chapter and calibrated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Calibration Procedure</p><p class="depth0">1. Principle. The calibration procedure is based on the photometric  assay of ozone (O3) concentrations in a dynamic flow system.  The concentration of O3 in an absorption cell is determined  from a measurement of the amount of 254 nm light absorbed by the sample.  This determination requires knowledge of (1) the absorption coefficient  ([alpha]) of O3 at 254 nm, (2) the optical path length (l)  through the sample, (3) the transmittance of the sample at a wavelength  of 254 nm, and (4) the temperature (T) and pressure (P) of the sample.  The transmittance is defined as the ratio I/I0, where I is  the intensity of light which passes through the cell and is sensed by  the detector when the cell contains an O3 sample, and  I0 is the intensity of light which passes through the cell  and is sensed by the detector when the cell contains zero air. It is  assumed that all conditions of the system, except for the contents of  the absorption cell, are identical during measurement of I and  I0. The quantities defined above are related by the Beer- Lambert absorption law, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU93.028  where:  [alpha] = absorption coefficient of O3 at 254 nm = 308 4 atm - 1 cm-1 at 0 [deg]C and 760</p><p class="depth0">torr. \3\\(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)\ c = O3 concentration in atmospheres l = optical path length in cm</p><p class="depth0">In practice, a stable O3 generator is used to produce  O3 concentrations over the required range. Each O3  concentration is determined from the measurement of the transmittance  (I/I0) of the sample at 254 nm with a photometer of path  length l and calculated from the equation, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU93.029     The calculated O3 concentrations must be corrected for  O3 losses which may occur in the photometer and for the  temperature and pressure of the sample.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability. This procedure is applicable to the calibration of  ambient air O3 analyzers, either directly or by means of a  transfer standard certified by this procedure. Transfer standards must  meet the requirements and specifications set forth in Reference 8.</p><p class="depth0">3. Apparatus. A complete UV calibration system consists of an ozone  generator, an output port or manifold, a photometer, an appropriate  source of zero air, and other components as necessary. The configuration  must provide a stable ozone concentration at the system output and allow  the photometer to accurately assay the output concentration to the  precision specified for the photometer (3.1). Figure 1 shows a commonly  used configuration and serves to illustrate the calibration procedure  which follows. Other configurations may require appropriate variations  in the procedural steps. All connections between components in the  calibration system downstream of the O3 generator should be  of glass, Teflon, or other relatively inert materials. Additional  information regarding the assembly of a UV photometric calibration  apparatus is given in Reference 9. For certification of transfer  standards which provide their own source of O3, the transfer  standard may replace the O3 generator and possibly other  components shown in Figure 1; see Reference 8 for guidance.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 UV photometer. The photometer consists of a low-pressure mercury  discharge lamp, (optional) collimation optics, an absorption cell, a  detector, and signal-processing electronics, as illustrated in Figure 1.  It must be capable of measuring the transmittance, I/I0, at a  wavelength of 254 nm with sufficient precision such that the standard  deviation of the concentration measurements does not exceed the greater  of 0.005 ppm or 3% of the concentration. Because the low-pressure  mercury lamp radiates at several wavelengths, the photometer must  incorporate suitable means to assure that no O3 is generated  in the cell by the lamp, and that at least 99.5% of the radiation sensed  by the detector is 254 nm radiation. (This can be readily achieved by  prudent selection of optical filter and detector response  characteristics.) The length of the light path through the absorption  cell must be known with an accuracy of at least 99.5%. In addition, the  cell and associated plumbing must be designed to minimize loss of  O3 from contact with cell walls and gas handling components.  See Reference 9 for additional information.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Air flow controllers. Devices capable of regulating air flows as  necessary to meet the output stability and photometer precision  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Ozone generator. Device capable of generating stable levels of  O3 over the required concentration range.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Output manifold. The output manifold should be constructed of  glass, Teflon, or other relatively inert material, and should be of  sufficient diameter to insure a negligible pressure drop at the  photometer connection and other output ports. The system must have a  vent designed to insure atmospheric pressure in the manifold and to  prevent ambient air from entering the manifold.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Two-way valve. Manual or automatic valve, or other means to  switch the photometer flow between zero air and the O3  concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Temperature indicator. Accurate to 1  [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Barometer or pressure indicator. Accurate to 2 torr.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reagents.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Zero air. The zero air must be free of contaminants which would  cause a detectable response from the O3 analyzer, and it  should be free of NO, C2 H4, and other species  which react with O3. A procedure for generating suitable zero  air is given in Reference 9. As shown in Figure 1, the zero air supplied  to the photometer cell for the I0 reference measurement must  be derived from the same source as the zero air used for generation of  the ozone concentration to be assayed (I measurement). When using the  photometer to certify a transfer standard having its own source of  ozone, see Reference 8 for guidance on meeting this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">5. Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 General operation. The calibration photometer must be dedicated  exclusively to use as a calibration standard. It should always be used  with clean, filtered calibration gases, and never used for ambient air  sampling. Consideration should be given to locating the calibration  photometer in a clean laboratory where it can be stationary, protected  from physical shock, operated by a responsible analyst, and used as a  common standard for all field calibrations via transfer standards.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Preparation. Proper operation of the photometer is of critical  importance to the accuracy of this procedure. The following steps will  help to verify proper operation. The steps are not necessarily required  prior to each use of the photometer. Upon initial operation of the  photometer, these steps should be carried out frequently, with all  quantitative results or indications recorded in a chronological record  either in tabular form or plotted on a graphical chart. As the  performance and stability record of the photometer is established, the  frequency of these steps may be reduced consistent with the documented  stability of the photometer.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.1 Instruction manual: Carry out all set up and adjustment  procedures or checks as described in the operation or instruction manual  associated with the photometer.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.2 System check: Check the photometer system for integrity,  leaks, cleanliness, proper flowrates, etc. Service or replace filters  and zero air scrubbers or other consumable materials, as necessary.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.3 Linearity: Verify that the photometer manufacturer has  adequately established that the linearity error of the photometer is  less than 3%, or test the linearity by dilution as follows: Generate and  assay an O3 concentration near the upper range limit of the  system (0.5 or 1.0 ppm), then accurately dilute that concentration with  zero air and reassay it. Repeat at several different dilution ratios.  Compare the assay of the original concentration with the assay of the  diluted concentration divided by the dilution ratio, as follows [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU93.030  where:  E = linearity error, percent A1 = assay of the original concentration A2 = assay of the diluted concentration R = dilution ratio = flow of original concentration divided by the total</p><p class="depth0">flow</p><p class="depth0">The linearity error must be less than 5%. Since the accuracy of the  measured flow-rates will affect the linearity error as measured this  way, the test is not necessarily conclusive. Additional information on  verifying linearity is contained in Reference 9.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.4 Intercomparison: When possible, the photometer should be  occasionally intercompared, either directly or via transfer standards,  with calibration photometers used by other agencies or laboratories.</p><p class="depth0">5.2.5 Ozone losses: Some portion of the O3 may be lost  upon contact with the photometer cell walls and gas handling components.  The magnitude of this loss must be determined and used to correct the  calculated O3 concentration. This loss must not exceed 5%.  Some guidelines for quantitatively determining this loss are discussed  in Reference 9.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Assay of O3 concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.1 Allow the photometer system to warm up and stabilizer.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.2 Verify that the flowrate through the photometer absorption  cell, F allows the cell to be flushed in a reasonably short period of  time (2 liter/min is a typical flow). The precision of the measurements  is inversely related to the time required for flushing, since the  photometer drift error increases with time.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3 Insure that the flowrate into the output manifold is at least  1 liter/min greater than the total flowrate required by the photometer  and any other flow demand connected to the manifold.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.4 Insure that the flowrate of zero air, Fz, is at  least 1 liter/min greater than the flowrate required by the photometer.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.5 With zero air flowing in the output manifold, actuate the two- way valve to allow the photometer to sample first the manifold zero air,  then Fz.

It is the operator's responsibility to verify that  all of the information required for equation 4 is obtained, either  automatically by the photometer or manually. For ``automatic''  photometers which evaluate the first term of equation 4 based on a  linear approximation, a manual correction may be required, particularly  at higher O3 levels. See the photometer instruction manual  and Reference 9 for guidance.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.11 Obtain additional O3 concentration standards as  necessary by repeating steps 5.3.6 to 5.3.10 or by Option 1.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Certification of transfer standards.

Atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)  are measured indirectly by photometrically measuring the light  intensity, at wavelengths greater than 600 nanometers, resulting from  the chemiluminescent reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with ozone  (O3). (1,2,3) NO2 is first quantitatively reduced  to NO(4,5,6) by means of a converter. NO, which commonly exists in  ambient air together with NO2, passes through the converter  unchanged causing a resultant total NOX concentration equal  to NO+NO2. A sample of the input air is also measured without  having passed through the converted. This latter NO measurement is  subtracted from the former measurement (NO+NO2) to yield the  final NO2 measurement. The NO and NO+NO2  measurements may be made concurrently with dual systems, or cyclically  with the same system provided the cycle time does not exceed 1 minute.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sampling considerations.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Chemiluminescence NO/NOX/NO2 analyzers  will respond to other nitrogen containing compounds, such as  peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), which might be reduced to NO in the thermal  converter. (7) Atmospheric concentrations of these potential  interferences are generally low relative to NO2 and valid  NO2 measurements may be obtained. In certain geographical  areas, where the concentration of these potential interferences is known  or suspected to be high relative to NO2, the use of an  equivalent method for the measurement of NO2 is recommended.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The use of integrating flasks on the sample inlet line of  chemiluminescence NO/NOX/NO2 analyzers is optional  and left to couraged. The sample residence time between the sampling  point and the analyzer should be kept to a minimum to avoid erroneous  NO2 measurements resulting from the reaction of ambient  levels of NO and O3 in the sampling system.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 The use of particulate filters on the sample inlet line of  chemiluminescence NO/NOX/NO2 analyzers is optional  and left to the discretion of the user or the manufacturer. Use of the filter should depend on the analyzer's susceptibility to  interference, malfunction, or damage due to particulates. Users are  cautioned that particulate matter concentrated on a filter may cause  erroneous NO2 measurements and therefore filters should be  changed frequently.</p><p class="depth0">3.

Ozone is added to excess NO in a dynamic calibration system,  and the NO channel of the chemiluminescence NO/NOX/ NO2 analyzer is used as an indicator of changes in NO  concentration. Upon the addition of O3, the decrease in NO  concentration observed on the calibrated NO channel is equivalent to the  concentration of NO2 produced.

Using the  NOX calibration curve obtained in step 2.4.8, measure and  record the NOX concentration as [NOX]M.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.9.3 Adjust FD to obtain several other concentrations of  NO2 over the NO2 range (at least five evenly  spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested). Calculate each  NO2 concentration using equation (20) and record the  corresponding analyzer NO2 and NOX responses. Plot  the analyzer's NO2 responses versus the corresponding  calculated NO2 concentrations and draw or calculate the  NO2 calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.10 Determination of converter efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.10.1 Plot [NOX]M (y-axis) versus  [NO2]OUT (x-axis) and draw or calculate the  converter efficiency curve. The slope of the curve times 100 is the  average converter efficiency, EC. The average converter efficiency must  be greater than 96 percent; if it is less than 96 percent, replace or  service the converter.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Supplemental information on calibration and other procedures  in this method are given in reference 13.</p><p class="depth0">3. Frequency of calibration. The frequency of calibration, as well  as the number of points necessary to establish the calibration curve and  the frequency of other performance checks, will vary from one analyzer  to another. The user's quality control program should provide guidelines  for initial establishment of these variables and for subsequent  alteration as operational experience is accumulated. Manufacturers of  analyzers should include in their instruction/operation manuals  information and guidance as to these variables and on other matters of  operation, calibration, and quality control.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1.

Appendix G to Part 50--Reference Method for the Determination of</p><p class="depth0">Lead in Total Suspended Particulate Matter</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Applicability</p><p class="depth0">Based on review of the air quality criteria and national ambient air  quality standard (NAAQS) for lead (Pb) completed in 2008, the EPA made  revisions to the primary and secondary NAAQS for Pb to protect public  health and welfare. The EPA revised the level from 1.5 [micro]g/m\3\ to  0.15 [micro]g/m\3\ while retaining the current indicator of Pb in total  suspended particulate matter (Pb-TSP).</p><p class="depth0">Pb-TSP is collected for 24 hours on a TSP filter as described in  Appendix B of part 50, the Reference Method for the Determination of  Suspended Particulate Matter in the Atmosphere (High-Volume Method).  This method is for the analysis of Pb from TSP filters by Inductively  Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) using a heated ultrasonic bath  with nitric acid (HNO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) or a  heated block (hot block) digester with HNO3 for filter  extraction.</p><p class="depth0">This method is based on the EPA's Office of Solid Waste (SW-846)  Method 6020A--Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (U.S. EPA,  2007). Wording in certain sections of this method is paraphrased or  taken directly from Method 6020A.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 ICP-MS is applicable for the sub-[micro]g/mL (ppb) determination  of Pb in a wide variety of matrices. Results reported for monitoring or  compliance purposes are calculated in [micro]g/m\3\ at local conditions  (LC). This procedure describes a method for the acid extraction of Pb in  particulate matter collected on glass fiber, quartz, or PTFE filters and  measurement of the extracted Pb using ICP-MS.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Due to variations in the isotopic abundance of Pb, the value for  total Pb must be based on the sum of the signal intensities for isotopic  masses, 206, 207, and 208. Most instrument software packages are able to  sum the primary isotope signal intensities automatically.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 ICP-MS requires the use of an internal standard. \115\In  (Indium), \165\Ho (Holmium), and \209\Bi (Bismuth) are recommended  internal standards for the determination of Pb.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Use of this method is restricted to use by, or under supervision  of, properly trained and experienced laboratory personnel. Requirements  include training and experience in inorganic sample preparation,  including acid extraction, and also knowledge in the recognition and in  the correction of spectral, chemical and physical interference in ICP- MS.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 This method describes the acid extraction of Pb in particulate  matter collected on glass fiber, quartz, or PTFE ambient air filters  with subsequent measurement of Pb by   ICP-MS. Estimates of the Method Detection Limit (MDL) or sensitivity of  the method are provided in Tables 1, 3 and 5 and determined using Pb- spiked filters or filter strips analyzed in accordance with the guidance  provided in 40 CFR 136, Appendix B--Determination and procedures for the  Determination of the Method Detection Limit--Revision 1.1. The  analytical range of the method is 0.00024 [micro]g/m\3\ to 0.60  [micro]g/m\3\, and based on the low and high calibration curve standards  and a nominal filter sample volume of 2000 m\3\.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 This method includes two extraction methods. In the first  method, a solution of HNO3 and HCl is added to the filters or  filter strips in plastic digestion tubes and the tubes are placed in a  heated ultrasonic bath for one hour to facilitate the extraction of Pb.  Following ultrasonication, the samples are brought to a final volume of  40 mL (50 mL for PTFE filters), vortex mixed or shaken vigorously, and  centrifuged prior to aliquots being taken for ICP-MS analysis. In the  second method, a solution of dilute HNO3 is added to the  filter strips in plastic digestion tubes and the tubes placed into the  hot block digester. The filter strip is completely covered by the  solution. The tubes are covered with polypropylene watch glasses and  refluxed. After reflux, the samples are diluted to a final volume of 50  mL with reagent water and mixed before analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Calibration standards and check standards are prepared to matrix  match the acid composition of the samples. ICP-MS analysis is then  performed. With this method, the samples are first aspirated and the  aerosol thus created is transported by a flow of argon gas into the  plasma torch. The ions produced (e.g., Pb\+1\) in the plasma are  extracted via a differentially-pumped vacuum interface and are separated  on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio. The ions are quantified by a  channel electron multiplier or a Faraday detector and the signal  collected is processed by the instrument's software. Interferences must  be assessed and corrected for, if present.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions  Pb--Elemental or ionic lead HNO3--Nitric acid HCl--Hydrochloric acid ICP-MS--Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer MDL--Method detection limit RSD--Relative standard deviation RPD--Relative percent difference CB--Calibration Blank CAL--Calibration Standard ICB--Initial calibration blank CCB--Continuing calibration blank ICV--Initial calibration verification CCV--Continuing calibration verification LLCV--Lower Level Calibration Verification, serves as the lower level  ICV and lower level CCV RB--Reagent blank RBS--Reagent blank spike MSDS--Material Safety Data Sheet NIST--National Institute of Standards and Technology D.I. water--Deionized water SRM--NIST Standard Reference Material CRM--Certified Reference Material EPA--Environmental Protection Agency v/v--Volume to volume ratio</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Reagents, glassware, plasticware, and other sample processing  hardware may yield artifacts and/or interferences to sample analysis. If  reagent blanks, filter blanks, or quality control blanks yield results  above the detection limit, the source of contamination must be  identified. All containers and reagents used in the processing of the  samples must be checked for contamination prior to sample extraction and  analysis. Reagents shall be diluted to match the final concentration of  the extracts and analyzed for Pb. Labware shall be rinsed with dilute  acid solution and the solution analyzed. Once a reagent or labware  article (such as extraction tubes) from a manufacturer has been  successfully screened, additional screening is not required unless  contamination is suspected.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Isobaric elemental interferences in ICP-MS are caused by  isotopes of different elements forming atomic ions with the same nominal  mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) as the species of interest. There are no  species found in ambient air that will result in isobaric interference  with the three Pb isotopes (206, 207, and 208) being measured.  Polyatomic interferences occur when two or more elements combine to form  an ion with the same mass-to-charge ratio as the isotope being measured.  Pb is not subject to interference from common polyatomic ions and no  correction is required.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 The distribution of Pb isotopes is not constant. The analysis of  total Pb should be based on the summation of signal intensities for the  isotopic masses 206, 207, and 208. In most cases, the instrument  software can perform the summation automatically.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Physical interferences are associated with the sample  nebulization and transport processes as well as with ion-transmission  efficiencies. Dissolved solids can deposit on the nebulizer tip of a  pneumatic nebulizer and on the interface skimmers of the ICP-MS.  Nebulization and transport processes can be affected if a matrix  component causes a change in surface tension or viscosity. Changes in  matrix composition can cause significant signal suppression or  enhancement. These interferences are compensated for by use of internal  standards. Sample dilution will reduce the effects of high levels of  dissolved salts, but calibration standards   must be prepared in the extraction medium and diluted accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Memory interferences are related to sample transport and result  when there is carryover from one sample to the next. Sample carryover  can result from sample deposition on the sample and skimmer cones and  from incomplete rinsing of the sample solution from the plasma torch and  the spray chamber between samples. These memory effects are dependent  upon both the analyte being measured and sample matrix and can be  minimized through the use of suitable rinse times.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Health and Safety Cautions</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of reagents used in this method  has not been fully established. Each chemical should be regarded as a  potential health hazard and exposure to these compounds should be as low  as reasonably achievable. Each laboratory is responsible for maintaining  a current file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the  chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material safety  data sheets (MSDSs) should be available to all personnel involved in the  chemical analysis. Specifically, concentrated HNO3 presents  various hazards and is moderately toxic and extremely irritating to skin  and mucus membranes. Use this reagent in a fume hood whenever possible  and if eye or skin contact occurs, flush with large volumes of water.  Always wear safety glasses or a shield for eye protection, protective  clothing, and observe proper mixing when working with these reagents.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Concentrated HNO3 and HCl are moderately toxic and  extremely irritating to the skin. Use these reagents in a fume hood, and  if eye and skin contact occurs, flush with large volumes of water.  Always wear safety glasses or a shield for eye protection when working  with these reagents. The component of this procedure requiring the  greatest care is HNO3. HNO3 is a strong,  corrosive, oxidizing agent that requires protection of the eyes, skin,  and clothing. Items to be worn during use of this reagent include:</p><p class="depth0">1. Safety goggles (or safety glasses with side shields),</p><p class="depth0">2. Acid resistant rubber gloves, and</p><p class="depth0">3. A protective garment such as a laboratory apron. HNO3  spilled on clothing will destroy the fabric; contact with the skin  underneath will result in a burn.</p><p class="depth0">It is also essential that an eye wash fountain or eye wash bottle be  available during performance of this method. An eye wash bottle has a  spout that covers the eye. If acid or any other corrosive gets into the  eye, the water in this bottle is squirted onto the eye to wash out the  harmful material. Eye washing should be performed with large amounts of  water immediately after exposure. Medical help should be sought  immediately after washing. If either acid, but especially  HNO3, is spilled onto the skin, wash immediately with large  amounts of water. Medical attention is not required unless the burn  appears to be significant. Even after washing and drying,  HNO3 may leave the skin slightly brown in color; this will  heal and fade with time.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Pb salts and Pb solutions are toxic. Great care must be taken to  ensure that samples and standards are handled properly; wash hands  thoroughly after handling.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Care must be taken when using the ultrasonic bath and hot block  digester as they are capable of causing mild burns. Users should refer  to the safety guidance provided by the manufacturer of their specific  equipment.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Analytical plasma sources emit radio frequency radiation in  addition to intense ultra violet (UV) radiation. Suitable precautions  should be taken to protect personnel from such hazards. The inductively  coupled plasma should only be viewed with proper eye protection from UV  emissions.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Thermo Scientific X-Series ICP-MS or equivalent.

Calibration standards are prepared by diluting  stock standards to the appropriate levels in the same acid  concentrations as in the final sample volume. The typical range for  calibration standards is 0.001 to 2.00 [micro]g/mL. At a minimum, the  curve must contain a blank and five Pb containing calibration standards.  The calibration standards are stored at ambient laboratory temperature.  Calibration standards must be prepared weekly and verified against a  freshly prepared ICV using a NIST-traceable source different from the  calibration standards.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Internal standards may be added to the test solution or by on- line addition. The nominal concentration for an internal standard is  0.010 [micro]g/mL (10 ppb). Bismuth (Bi) or holmium (Ho) are the  preferred internal standards for Pb, but indium (In) may be used in the  event the sample contains Bi and high recoveries are observed.</p><p class="depth0">7.7 Three laboratory blank solutions are required for analysis: (1)  The calibration   blank is used in the construction of the calibration curve and as a  periodic check of system cleanliness (ICB and CCB); (2) the reagent  blank (RB) is carried through the extraction process to assess possible  contamination; and (3) the rinse blank is run between samples to clean  the sample introduction system. If RBs or laboratory blanks yield  results above the detection limit, the source of contamination must be  identified. Screening of labware and reagents is addressed in Section  4.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.1 The calibration blank is prepared in the same acid matrix as  the calibration standards and samples and contains all internal  standards used in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.2 The RB contains all reagents used in the extraction and is  carried through the extraction procedure at the same time as the  samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.3 The rinse blank is a solution of 1 to 2 percent  HNO3 (v/v) in reagent grade water. A sufficient volume should  be prepared to flush the system between all standards and samples  analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.4 The EPA currently provides glass fiber, quartz, and PTFE  filters to air monitoring agencies as requested annually. As part of the  procurement process, these filters are tested for acceptance by the EPA.  The current acceptance criteria for glass fiber and quartz filters is 15  [micro]g per filter or 0.0075 [micro]g/m\3\ using a nominal sample  volume of 2000 m\3\ and 4.8 ng/cm\2\ or 0.0024 [micro]g/m\3\ for PTFE  filters using a nominal sample volume of 24 m\3\. Acceptance test  results for filters obtained by the EPA are typically well below the  criterion specified and also below the recently revised Pb method  performance detection limit of 0.0075 [micro]g/m\3\; therefore, blank  subtraction should not be performed.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.5 If filters are not provided by the EPA for sample collection  and analysis, filter lot blanks should be analyzed for Pb content. For  large filter lots (500 filters), randomly select 20 to 30  filters from the lot and analyze the filter or filter strips for Pb. For  smaller filter lots, a lesser number of filters can be analyzed. Glass,  quartz and PTFE filters must not have levels of Pb above the criteria  specified in section 7.7.4 and, therefore, blank correction should not  be performed. If acceptance testing shows levels of Pb above the  criteria in Section 7.7.4, corrective action must be taken to reduce the  levels before proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">7.8 The Initial Calibration Verification (ICV), Lower Level  Calibration Verification (LLCV), and Continuing Calibration Verification  (CCV) solutions are prepared from a different Pb source than the  calibration curve standards and at a concentration that is either at or  below the midpoint on the calibration curve, but within the calibration  range. Both are prepared in the same acid matrix as the calibration  standards. Note that the same solution may be used for both the ICV and  CCV. The ICV/CCV and LLCV solutions must be prepared fresh daily.</p><p class="depth0">7.9 Tuning Solution. Prepare a tuning solution according to the  instrument manufacturer's recommendations. This solution will be used to  verify the mass calibration and resolution of the instrument.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Quality Control (QC)</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Standard QC practices shall be employed to assess the validity  of the data generated, including: MDL, RB, duplicate samples, spiked  samples, serial dilutions, ICV, CCV, LLCV, ICB, CCB, and SRMs/CRMs.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 MDLs must be calculated in accordance with 40 CFR part 136,  Appendix B. RBs with low-level standard spikes are used to estimate the  MDL. The low-level standard spike is added to at least 7 individual  filter strips and then carried through the entire extraction procedure.  This will result in at least 7 individual samples to be used for the  MDL. The recommended range for spiking the strips is 1 to 5 times the  estimated MDL.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 For each batch of samples, one RB and one reagent blank spike  (RBS) that is spiked at the same level as the sample spike (see Section  8.6) must be prepared and carried throughout the entire process. The  results of the RB must be below 0.001 [micro]g/mL. The recovery for the  RBS must be within 20 percent of the expected  value. If the RB yields a result above 0.001 [micro]g/mL, the source of  contamination must be identified and the extraction and analysis  repeated. Reagents and labware must be suspected as sources of  contamination. Screening of reagents and labware is addressed in Section  4.1.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Any samples that exceed the highest calibration standard must be  diluted and rerun so that the concentration falls within the curve. The  minimum dilution will be 1 to 5 with matrix matched acid solution.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 The internal standard response must be monitored during the  analysis. If the internal standard response falls below 70 percent or  rises above 120 percent of expected due to possible matrix effects, the  sample must be diluted and reanalyzed. The minimum dilution will be 1 to  5 with matrix matched acid solution. If the first dilution does not  correct the problem, additional dilutions must be run until the internal  standard falls within the specified range.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 For every batch of samples prepared, there must be one duplicate  and one spike sample prepared. The spike added is to be at a level that  falls within the calibration curve, normally the midpoint of the curve.

Appendix H to Part 50--Interpretation of the 1-Hour Primary and</p><p class="depth0">Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">This appendix explains how to determine when the expected number of  days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations above  0.12 ppm (235 [micro]g/m\3\) is equal to or less than 1. An expanded  discussion of these procedures and associated examples are contained in  the ``Guideline for Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards.'' For  purposes of clarity in the following discussion, it is convenient to use  the term ``exceedance'' to describe a daily maximum hourly average ozone  measurement that is greater than the level of the standard. Therefore,  the phrase ``expected number of days with maximum hourly average ozone  concentrations above the level of the standard'' may be simply stated as  the ``expected number of exceedances.''</p><p class="depth0">The basic principle in making this determination is relatively  straightforward. Most of the complications that arise in determining the  expected number of annual exceedances relate to accounting for  incomplete sampling. In general, the average number of exceedances per  calendar year must be less than or equal to 1. In its simplest form, the  number of exceedances at a monitoring site would be recorded for each  calendar year and then averaged over the past 3 calendar years to  determine if this average is less than or equal to 1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interpretation of Expected Exceedances</p><p class="depth0">The ozone standard states that the expected number of exceedances  per year must be less than or equal to 1. The statistical term  ``expected number'' is basically an arithmetic average. The following  example explains what it would mean for an area to be in compliance with  this type of standard. Suppose a monitoring station records a valid  daily maximum hourly average ozone value for every day of the year  during the past 3 years. At the end of each year, the number of days  with maximum hourly concentrations above 0.12 ppm is determined and this  number is averaged with the results of previous years. As long as this  average remains ``less than or equal to 1,'' the area is in compliance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Estimating the Number of Exceedances for a Year</p><p class="depth0">In general, a valid daily maximum hourly average value may not be  available for each day of the year, and it will be necessary to account  for these missing values when estimating the number of exceedances for a  particular calendar year. The purpose of these computations is to  determine if the expected number of exceedances per year is less than or  equal to 1. Thus, if a site has two or more observed exceedances each  year, the standard is not met and it is not necessary to use the  procedures of this section to account for incomplete sampling.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``missing value'' is used here in the general sense to  describe all days that do not have an associated ozone measurement.   In some cases, a measurement might actually have been missed but in  other cases no measurement may have been scheduled for that day. A daily  maximum ozone value is defined to be the highest hourly ozone value  recorded for the day. This daily maximum value is considered to be valid  if 75 percent of the hours from 9:01 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (LST) were  measured or if the highest hour is greater than the level of the  standard.</p><p class="depth0">In some areas, the seasonal pattern of ozone is so pronounced that  entire months need not be sampled because it is extremely unlikely that  the standard would be exceeded. Any such waiver of the ozone monitoring  requirement would be handled under provisions of 40 CFR, part 58. Some  allowance should also be made for days for which valid daily maximum  hourly values were not obtained but which would quite likely have been  below the standard. Such an allowance introduces a complication in that  it becomes necessary to define under what conditions a missing value may  be assumed to have been less than the level of the standard. The  following criterion may be used for ozone:</p><p class="depth0">A missing daily maximum ozone value may be assumed to be less than  the level of the standard if the valid daily maxima on both the  preceding day and the following day do not exceed 75 percent of the  level of the standard.</p><p class="depth0">Let z denote the number of missing daily maximum values that may be  assumed to be less than the standard. Then the following formula shall  be used to estimate the expected number of exceedances for the year: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08NO91.086</p><p class="depth0">(*Indicates multiplication.)  where:  e = the estimated number of exceedances for the year, N = the number of required monitoring days in the year, n = the number of valid daily maxima, v = the number of daily values above the level of the standard, and z = the number of days assumed to be less than the standard level.</p><p class="depth0">This estimated number of exceedances shall be rounded to one decimal  place (fractional parts equal to 0.05 round up).</p><p class="depth0">It should be noted that N will be the total number of days in the  year unless the appropriate Regional Administrator has granted a waiver  under the provisions of 40 CFR part 58.</p><p class="depth0">The above equation may be interpreted intuitively in the following  manner. The estimated number of exceedances is equal to the observed  number of exceedances (v) plus an increment that accounts for incomplete  sampling. There were (N-n) missing values for the year but a certain  number of these, namely z, were assumed to be less than the standard.  Therefore, (N-n-z) missing values are considered to include possible  exceedances. The fraction of measured values that are above the level of  the standard is v/n. It is assumed that this same fraction applies to  the (N-n-z) missing values and that (v/n)*(N-n-z) of these values would  also have exceeded the level of the standard.

Ozone is measured in the ambient air by a reference method based on  appendix D of this part. Data reporting, data handling, and computation  procedures to be used in making comparisons between reported ozone  concentrations and the level of the ozone standard are specified in the  following sections. Whether to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to  the data affected by stratospheric ozone intrusion or other natural  events is subject to the approval of the appropriate Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">2. Primary and Secondary Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Data Reporting and Handling Conventions.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Computing 8-hour averages. Hourly average concentrations shall  be reported in parts per million (ppm) to the third decimal place, with  additional digits to the right being truncated. Running 8-hour averages  shall be computed from the hourly ozone concentration data for each hour  of the year and the result shall be stored in the first, or start, hour  of the 8-hour period. An 8-hour average shall be considered valid if at  least 75% of the hourly averages for the 8-hour period are available. In  the event that only 6 (or 7) hourly averages are available, the 8-hour  average shall be computed on the basis of the hours available using 6  (or 7) as the divisor. (8-hour periods with three or more missing hours  shall not be ignored if, after substituting one-half the minimum  detectable limit for the missing hourly concentrations, the 8-hour  average concentration is greater than the level of the standard.) The  computed 8-hour average ozone concentrations shall be reported to three  decimal places (the insignificant digits to the right of the third  decimal place are truncated, consistent with the data handling  procedures for the reported data.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There are 24  possible running 8-hour average ozone concentrations for each calendar  day during the ozone monitoring season. (Ozone monitoring seasons vary  by geographic location as designated in part 58, appendix D to this  chapter.) The daily maximum 8-hour concentration for a given calendar  day is the highest of the 24 possible 8-hour average concentrations  computed for that day. This process is repeated, yielding a daily  maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration for each calendar day with  ambient ozone monitoring data. Because the 8-hour averages are recorded  in the start hour, the daily maximum 8-hour concentrations from two  consecutive days may have some hourly concentrations in common.  Generally, overlapping daily maximum 8-hour averages are not likely,  except in those non-urban monitoring locations with less pronounced  diurnal variation in hourly concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An ozone monitoring day shall be counted as a valid day if valid  8-hour averages are available for at least 75% of possible hours in the  day (i.e., at least 18 of the 24 averages).

The  standard-related summary statistic is the annual fourth-highest daily  maximum 8-hour ozone concentration, expressed in parts per million,  averaged over three years. The 3-year average shall be computed using  the three most recent, consecutive calendar years of monitoring data  meeting the data completeness requirements described in this appendix.

The number of significant figures in  the level of the standard dictates the rounding convention for comparing  the computed 3-year average annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour  average ozone concentration with the level of the standard. The third  decimal place of the computed value is rounded, with values equal to or  greater than 5 rounding up. Thus, a computed 3-year average ozone  concentration of 0.085 ppm is the smallest value that is greater than  0.08 ppm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This comparison shall be based on three consecutive, complete  calendar years of air quality monitoring data. This requirement is met  for the three year period at a monitoring site if daily maximum 8-hour  average concentrations are available for at least 90%, on average, of  the days during the designated ozone monitoring season, with a minimum  data completeness in any one year of at least 75% of the designated  sampling days. When computing whether the minimum data completeness  requirements have been met, meteorological or ambient data may be  sufficient to demonstrate that meteorological conditions on missing days  were not conducive to concentrations above the level of the standard.  Missing days assumed less than the level of the standard are counted for  the purpose of meeting the data completeness requirement, subject to the  approval of the appropriate Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Years with concentrations greater than the level of the standard  shall not be ignored on the ground that they have less than complete  data.

Design Values for Primary and Secondary Ambient Air Quality  Standards for Ozone. The air quality design value at a monitoring site  is defined as that concentration that when reduced to the level of the  standard ensures that the site meets the standard. For a concentration- based standard, the air quality design value is simply the standard- related test statistic. Thus, for the primary and secondary ozone  standards, the 3-year average annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour  average ozone concentration is also the air quality design value for the  site.

Appendix J to Part 50--Reference Method for the Determination of</p><p class="depth0">Particulate Matter as PM10 in the Atmosphere</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Applicability.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method provides for the measurement of the mass  concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less  than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM1O) in ambient  air over a 24-hour period for purposes of determining attainment and  maintenance of the primary and secondary national ambient air quality  standards for particulate matter specified in Sec. 50.6 of this  chapter. The measurement process is nondestructive, and the  PM10 sample can be subjected to subsequent physical or  chemical analyses. Quality assurance procedures and guidance are  provided in part 58, appendices A and B, of this chapter and in  References 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Principle.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 An air sampler draws ambient air at a constant flow rate into a  specially shaped inlet where the suspended particulate matter is  inertially separated into one or more size fractions within the  PM10 size range. Each size fraction in the PM1O  size range is then collected on a separate filter over the specified  sampling period. The particle size discrimination characteristics  (sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint) of the sampler inlet  are prescribed as performance specifications in part 53 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Each filter is weighed (after moisture equilibration) before and  after use to determine the net weight (mass) gain due to collected  PM10. The total volume of air sampled, corrected to EPA  reference conditions (25 C, 101.3 kPa), is determined from the measured  flow rate and the sampling time.   The mass concentration of PM10 in the ambient air is computed  as the total mass of collected particles in the PM10 size  range divided by the volume of air sampled, and is expressed in  micrograms per standard cubic meter ([micro]g/std m\3\). For  PM10 samples collected at temperatures and pressures  significantly different from EPA reference conditions, these corrected  concentrations sometimes differ substantially from actual concentrations  (in micrograms per actual cubic meter), particularly at high elevations.  Although not required, the actual PM10 concentration can be  calculated from the corrected concentration, using the average ambient  temperature and barometric pressure during the sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 A method based on this principle will be considered a reference  method only if (a) the associated sampler meets the requirements  specified in this appendix and the requirements in part 53 of this  chapter, and (b) the method has been designated as a reference method in  accordance with part 53 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Range.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The lower limit of the mass concentration range is determined by  the repeatability of filter tare weights, assuming the nominal air  sample volume for the sampler. For samplers having an automatic filter- changing mechanism, there may be no upper limit. For samplers that do  not have an automatic filter-changing mechanism, the upper limit is  determined by the filter mass loading beyond which the sampler no longer  maintains the operating flow rate within specified limits due to  increased pressure drop across the loaded filter. This upper limit  cannot be specified precisely because it is a complex function of the  ambient particle size distribution and type, humidity, filter type, and  perhaps other factors. Nevertheless, all samplers should be capable of  measuring 24-hour PM10 mass concentrations of at least 300  [micro]g/std m\3\ while maintaining the operating flow rate within the  specified limits.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Precision.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 The precision of PM10 samplers must be 5 [micro]g/ m\3\ for PM10 concentrations below 80 [micro]g/m\3\ and 7  percent for PM10 concentrations above 80 [micro]g/m\3\, as  required by part 53 of this chapter, which prescribes a test procedure  that determines the variation in the PM10 concentration  measurements of identical samplers under typical sampling conditions.  Continual assessment of precision via collocated samplers is required by  part 58 of this chapter for PM10 samplers used in certain  monitoring networks.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Because the size of the particles making up ambient particulate  matter varies over a wide range and the concentration of particles  varies with particle size, it is difficult to define the absolute  accuracy of PM10 samplers. Part 53 of this chapter provides a  specification for the sampling effectiveness of PM10  samplers. This specification requires that the expected mass  concentration calculated for a candidate PM10 sampler, when  sampling a specified particle size distribution, be within 10 percent of that calculated for an ideal sampler whose  sampling effectiveness is explicitly specified. Also, the particle size  for 50 percent sampling effectiveness is required to be 10 0.5 micrometers. Other specifications related to  accuracy apply to flow measurement and calibration, filter media,  analytical (weighing) procedures, and artifact. The flow rate accuracy  of PM10 samplers used in certain monitoring networks is  required by part 58 of this chapter to be assessed periodically via flow  rate audits.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Potential Sources of Error.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Volatile Particles. Volatile particles collected on filters are  often lost during shipment and/or storage of the filters prior to the  post-sampling weighing \3\. Although shipment or storage of loaded  filters is sometimes unavoidable, filters should be reweighed as soon as  practical to minimize these losses.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Artifacts. Positive errors in PM10 concentration  measurements may result from retention of gaseous species on filters. \4  5\ Such errors include the retention of sulfur dioxide and nitric acid.  Retention of sulfur dioxide on filters, followed by oxidation to  sulfate, is referred to as artifact sulfate formation, a phenomenon  which increases with increasing filter alkalinity. \6\ Little or no  artifact sulfate formation should occur using filters that meet the  alkalinity specification in section 7.2.4. Artifact nitrate formation,  resulting primarily from retention of nitric acid, occurs to varying  degrees on many filter types, including glass fiber, cellulose ester,  and many quartz fiber filters. \5 7 8 9 10\ Loss of true atmospheric  particulate nitrate during or following sampling may also occur due to  dissociation or chemical reaction. This phenomenon has been observed on  Teflon [supreg] filters \8\ and inferred for quartz fiber filters. \11  12\ The magnitude of nitrate artifact errors in PM10 mass  concentration measurements will vary with location and ambient  temperature; however, for most sampling locations, these errors are  expected to be small.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Humidity. The effects of ambient humidity on the sample are  unavoidable. The filter equilibration procedure in section 9.0 is  designed to minimize the effects of moisture on the filter medium.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Filter Handling. Careful handling of filters between presampling  and postsampling weighings is necessary to avoid errors due to damaged  filters or loss of collected particles from the filters. Use of a filter  cartridge or cassette may reduce the magnitude of these errors. Filters  must also meet the integrity specification in section 7.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Flow Rate Variation. Variations in the sampler's operating flow  rate may alter the particle size discrimination characteristics of the  sampler inlet. The magnitude of this error will depend on the  sensitivity of the inlet to variations in flow rate and on the particle  distribution in the atmosphere during the sampling period. The use of a  flow control device (section 7.1.3) is required to minimize this error.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Air Volume Determination. Errors in the air volume determination  may result from errors in the flow rate and/or sampling time  measurements. The flow control device serves to minimize errors in the  flow rate determination, and an elapsed time meter (section 7.1.5) is  required to minimize the error in the sampling time measurement.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">7.1 PM10 Sampler.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 The sampler shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth0">a.

No commercially available filter medium is  ideal in all respects for all samplers. The user's goals in sampling  determine the relative importance of various filter characteristics  (e.g., cost, ease of handling, physical and chemical characteristics,  etc.) and, consequently, determine the choice among acceptable filters.  Furthermore, certain types of filters may not be suitable for use with  some samplers, particularly under heavy loading conditions (high mass  concentrations), because of high or rapid increase in the filter flow  resistance that would exceed the capability of the sampler's flow  control device. However, samplers equipped with automatic filter- changing mechanisms may allow use of these types of filters. The  specifications given below are minimum requirements to ensure  acceptability of the filter medium for measurement of PM10  mass concentrations.

The flow rate transfer standard  must be suitable for the sampler's operating flow rate and must be  calibrated against a primary flow or volume standard that is traceable  to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The flow   rate transfer standard must be capable of measuring the sampler's  operating flow rate with an accuracy of 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Filter Conditioning Environment.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 Temperature range: 15 to 30 C.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 Temperature control: 3 C.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.3 Humidity range: 20% to 45% RH.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.4 Humidity control: 5% RH.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Analytical Balance. The analytical balance must be suitable for  weighing the type and size of filters required by the sampler. The range  and sensitivity required will depend on the filter tare weights and mass  loadings. Typically, an analytical balance with a sensitivity of 0.1 mg  is required for high volume samplers (flow rates 0.5 m\3\/ min). Lower volume samplers (flow rates <0.5 m\3\/min) will require a  more sensitive balance.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Calibration.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 General Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 Calibration of the sampler's flow measurement device is  required to establish traceability of subsequent flow measurements to a  primary standard.

Therefore, the flow rate through the sampler's inlet must be  maintained throughout the sampling period within the design flow rate  range specified by the manufacturer. Design flow rates are specified as  actual volumetric flow rates, measured at existing conditions of  temperature and pressure (Qa).

The specific procedure used for flow rate  calibration or verification will vary depending on the type of flow  controller and flow indicator employed. Calibration in terms of actual  volumetric flow rates (Qa) is generally recommended, but  other measures of flow rate (e.g., Qstd) may be used provided  the requirements of section 8.1 are met. The general procedure given  here is based on actual volumetric flow units (Qa) and serves  to illustrate the steps involved in the calibration of a PM10  sampler. Consult the sampler manufacturer's instruction manual and  Reference 2 for specific guidance on calibration.

Record the ambient temperature and barometric  pressure. Temperature and pressure corrections to subsequent flow  indicator readings may be required for certain types of flow measurement  devices. When such corrections are necessary, correction on an  individual or daily basis is preferable. However, seasonal average  temperature and average barometric pressure for the sampling site may be  incorporated into the sampler calibration to avoid daily corrections.

For the primary and secondary standards,  particulate matter is measured in the ambient air as PM10  (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal  10 micrometers) by a reference method based on appendix J of this part  and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter, or by an  equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.  The required frequency of measurements is specified in part 58 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The terms used in this appendix are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Average refers to the arithmetic mean of the estimated number of  exceedances per year, as per Section 3.1.</p><p class="depth0">Daily value for PM10 refers to the 24-hour average  concentration of PM10 calculated or measured from midnight to  midnight (local time).</p><p class="depth0">Exceedance means a daily value that is above the level of the 24- hour standard after rounding to the nearest 10 [micro]g/m\3\ (i.e.,  values ending in 5 or greater are to be rounded up).</p><p class="depth0">Expected annual value is the number approached when the annual  values from an increasing number of years are averaged, in the absence  of long-term trends in emissions or meteorological conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Year refers to a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Although the discussion in this appendix focuses on monitored  data, the same principles apply to modeling data, subject to EPA  modeling guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Attainment Determinations</p><p class="depth0">2.1 24-Hour Primary and Secondary Standards</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> the 24-hour primary and secondary standards  are attained when the expected number of exceedances per year at each  monitoring site is less than or equal to one. In the simplest case, the  number of expected exceedances at a site is determined by recording the  number of exceedances in each calendar year and then averaging them over  the past 3 calendar years. Situations in which 3 years of data are not  available and possible adjustments for unusual events or trends are  discussed in sections 2.3 and 2.4 of this appendix. Further, when data  for a year are incomplete, it is necessary to compute an estimated  number of exceedances for that year by adjusting the observed number of  exceedances. This procedure, performed by calendar quarter, is described  in section 3.0 of this appendix. The expected number of exceedances is  then estimated by averaging the individual annual estimates for the past  3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The comparison with the allowable expected exceedance rate of  one per year is made in terms of a number rounded to the nearest tenth  (fractional values equal to or greater than 0.05 are to be rounded up;  e.g., an exceedance rate of 1.05 would be rounded   to 1.1, which is the lowest rate for nonattainment).</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Reserved</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Data Requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 40 CFR 58.12 specifies the required minimum frequency of  sampling for PM10. For the purposes of making comparisons  with the particulate matter standards, all data produced by State and  Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) and other sites submitted to EPA  in accordance with the part 58 requirements must be used, and a minimum  of 75 percent of the scheduled PM10 samples per quarter are  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To demonstrate attainment of the 24-hour standards at a  monitoring site, the monitor must provide sufficient data to perform the  required calculations of sections 3.0 and 4.0 of this appendix. The  amount of data required varies with the sampling frequency, data capture  rate and the number of years of record. In all cases, 3 years of  representative monitoring data that meet the 75 percent criterion of the  previous paragraph should be utilized, if available, and would suffice.  More than 3 years may be considered, if all additional representative  years of data meeting the 75 percent criterion are utilized. Data not  meeting these criteria may also suffice to show attainment; however,  such exceptions will have to be approved by the appropriate Regional  Administrator in accordance with EPA guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> There are less stringent data requirements for showing that a  monitor has failed an attainment test and thus has recorded a violation  of the particulate matter standards. Although it is generally necessary  to meet the minimum 75 percent data capture requirement per quarter to  use the computational equations described in section 3.0 of this  appendix, this criterion does not apply when less data is sufficient to  unambiguously establish nonattainment. The following examples illustrate  how nonattainment can be demonstrated when a site fails to meet the  completeness criteria. Nonattainment of the 24-hour primary standards  can be established by the observed annual number of exceedances (e.g.,  four observed exceedances in a single year), or by the estimated number  of exceedances derived from the observed number of exceedances and the  required number of scheduled samples (e.g., two observed exceedances  with every other day sampling). In both cases, expected annual values  must exceed the levels allowed by the standards.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Adjustment for Exceptional Events and Trends</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An exceptional event is an uncontrollable event caused by  natural sources of particulate matter or an event that is not expected  to recur at a given location. Inclusion of such a value in the  computation of exceedances or averages could result in inappropriate  estimates of their respective expected annual values. To reduce the  effect of unusual events, more than 3 years of representative data may  be used. Alternatively, other techniques, such as the use of statistical  models or the use of historical data could be considered so that the  event may be discounted or weighted according to the likelihood that it  will recur. The use of such techniques is subject to the approval of the  appropriate Regional Administrator in accordance with EPA guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In cases where long-term trends in emissions and air quality are  evident, mathematical techniques should be applied to account for the  trends to ensure that the expected annual values are not inappropriately  biased by unrepresentative data. In the simplest case, if 3 years of  data are available under stable emission conditions, this data should be  used. In the event of a trend or shift in emission patterns, either the  most recent representative year(s) could be used or statistical  techniques or models could be used in conjunction with previous years of  data to adjust for trends. The use of less than 3 years of data, and any  adjustments are subject to the approval of the appropriate Regional  Administrator in accordance with EPA guidance.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Computational Equations for the 24-Hour Standards</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Estimating Exceedances for a Year</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If PM10 sampling is scheduled less frequently than  every day, or if some scheduled samples are missed, a PM10  value will not be available for each day of the year. To account for the  possible effect of incomplete data, an adjustment must be made to the  data collected at each monitoring location to estimate the number of  exceedances in a calendar year. In this adjustment, the assumption is  made that the fraction of missing values that would have exceeded the  standard level is identical to the fraction of measured values above  this level. This computation is to be made for all sites that are  scheduled to monitor throughout the entire year and meet the minimum  data requirements of section 2.3 of this appendix. Because of possible  seasonal imbalance, this adjustment shall be applied on a quarterly  basis. The estimate of the expected number of exceedances for the  quarter is equal to the observed number of exceedances plus an increment  associated with the missing data. The following equation must be used  for these computations:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.000  Where:  eq = the estimated number of exceedances for calendar quarter</p><p class="depth0">q; vq = the observed number of exceedances for calendar quarter</p><p class="depth0">q; Nq = the number of days in calendar quarter q; nq = the number of days in calendar quarter q with</p><p class="depth0">PM10 data; and q = the index for calendar quarter, q = 1, 2, 3 or 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The estimated number of exceedances for a calendar quarter must  be rounded to the nearest hundredth (fractional values equal to or  greater than 0.005 must be rounded up).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The estimated number of exceedances for the year, e, is the sum  of the estimates for each calendar quarter. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The estimated number of exceedances for a single year must be  rounded to one decimal place (fractional values equal to or greater than  0.05 are to be rounded up). The expected number of exceedances is then  estimated by averaging the individual annual estimates for the most  recent 3 or more representative years of data. The expected number of  exceedances must be rounded to one decimal place (fractional values  equal to or greater than 0.05 are to be rounded up).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The adjustment for incomplete data will not be necessary for  monitoring or modeling data which constitutes a complete record, i.e.,  365 days per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> To reduce the potential for overestimating the number of  expected exceedances, the correction for missing data will not be  required for a calendar quarter in which the first observed exceedance  has occurred if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There was only one exceedance in the calendar quarter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Everyday sampling is subsequently initiated and maintained for 4  calendar quarters in accordance with 40 CFR 58.12; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Data capture of 75 percent is achieved during the required  period of everyday sampling. In addition, if the first exceedance is  observed in a calendar quarter in which the monitor is already sampling  every day, no adjustment for missing data will be made to the first  exceedance if a 75 percent data capture rate was achieved in the quarter  in which it was observed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1</p><p class="depth0">a. During a particular calendar quarter, 39 out of a possible 92  samples were recorded, with one observed exceedance of the 24-hour  standard. Using Equation 1, the estimated number of exceedances for the  quarter is:  eq = 1 x 92/39 = 2.359 or 2.36.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the estimated exceedances for the other 3 calendar quarters in  the year were 2.30, 0.0 and 0.0, then, using Equation 2, the estimated  number of exceedances for the year is 2.36 + 2.30 + 0.0 + 0.0 which  equals 4.66 or 4.7. If no exceedances were observed for the 2 previous  years, then the expected number of exceedances is estimated by: (\1/3\)  x (4.7 + 0 + 0) = 1.57 or 1.6. Since 1.6 exceeds the allowable number of  expected exceedances, this monitoring site would fail the attainment  test.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2</p><p class="depth0">In this example, everyday sampling was initiated following the first  observed exceedance as required by 40 CFR 58.12. Accordingly, the first  observed exceedance would not be adjusted for incomplete sampling.  During the next three quarters, 1.2 exceedances were estimated. In this  case, the estimated exceedances for the year would be 1.0 + 1.2 + 0.0 +  0.0 which equals 2.2. If, as before, no exceedances were observed for  the two previous years, then the estimated exceedances for the 3-year  period would then be (\1/3\) x (2.2 + 0.0 + 0.0) = 0.7, and the  monitoring site would not fail the attainment test.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Adjustments for Non-Scheduled Sampling Days</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If a systematic sampling schedule is used and sampling is  performed on days in addition to the days specified by the systematic  sampling schedule, e.g., during episodes of high pollution, then an  adjustment must be made in the equation for the estimation of  exceedances. Such an adjustment is needed to eliminate the bias in the  estimate of the quarterly and annual number of exceedances that would  occur if the chance of an exceedance is different for scheduled than for  non-scheduled days, as would be the case with episode sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The required adjustment treats the systematic sampling schedule  as a stratified sampling plan. If the period from one scheduled sample  until the day preceding the next scheduled sample is defined as a  sampling stratum, then there is one stratum for each scheduled sampling  day. An average number of observed exceedances is computed for each of  these sampling strata. With nonscheduled sampling days, the estimated  number of exceedances is defined as:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.002  Where:  eq = the estimated number of exceedances for the quarter; Nq = the number of days in the quarter; mq = the number of strata with samples during the quarter; vj = the number of observed exceedances in stratum j; and kj = the number of actual samples in stratum j.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Note that if only one sample value is recorded in each stratum,  then Equation 3 reduces to Equation 1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3</p><p class="depth0">A monitoring site samples according to a systematic sampling  schedule of one sample every 6 days, for a total of 15 scheduled samples  in a quarter out of a total of 92 possible samples. During one 6-day  period, potential episode levels of PM10 were suspected, so 5  additional samples were taken. One of the regular scheduled samples was  missed, so a total of 19 samples in 14 sampling strata were measured.  The one 6-day sampling stratum with 6 samples recorded 2 exceedances.  The remainder of the quarter with one sample per stratum recorded zero  exceedances. Using Equation 3, the estimated number of exceedances for  the quarter is:</p><p class="depth0">Eq = (92/14) x (2/6 + 0 +. . .+ 0) = 2.19.  [71 FR 61224, Oct. 17, 2006]</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The measurement process is considered to be  nondestructive, and the PM2.5 sample obtained can be  subjected to subsequent physical or chemical analyses.

The air sampler and other aspects of this reference  method are specified either explicitly in this appendix or generally  with reference to other applicable regulations or quality assurance  guidance.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Each filter is weighed (after moisture and temperature  conditioning) before and after sample collection to determine the net  gain due to collected PM2.5. The total volume of air sampled  is determined by the sampler from the measured flow rate at actual  ambient temperature and pressure and the sampling time. The mass  concentration of PM2.5 in the ambient air is computed as the  total mass of collected particles in the PM2.5 size range  divided by the actual volume of air sampled, and is expressed in  micrograms per cubic meter of air ([micro]g/m\3\).</p><p class="depth0">3.0 PM2.5 Measurement Range.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Lower concentration limit. The lower detection limit of the mass  concentration measurement range is estimated to be approximately 2  [micro]g/m\3\, based on noted mass changes in field blanks in  conjunction with the 24 m\3\ nominal total air sample volume specified  for the 24-hour sample.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Upper concentration limit. The upper limit of the mass  concentration range is determined by the filter mass loading beyond  which the sampler can no longer maintain the operating flow rate within  specified limits due to increased pressure drop across the loaded  filter. This upper limit cannot be specified precisely because it is a  complex function of the ambient particle size distribution and type,  humidity, the individual filter used, the capacity of the sampler flow  rate control system, and perhaps other factors. Nevertheless, all  samplers are estimated to be capable of measuring 24-hour  PM2.5 mass concentrations of at least 200 [micro]g/   m\3\ while maintaining the operating flow rate within the specified  limits.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Sample period. The required sample period for PM2.5  concentration measurements by this method shall be 1,380 to 1500 minutes  (23 to 25 hours). However, when a sample period is less than 1,380  minutes, the measured concentration (as determined by the collected  PM2.5 mass divided by the actual sampled air volume),  multiplied by the actual number of minutes in the sample period and  divided by 1,440, may be used as if it were a valid concentration  measurement for the specific purpose of determining a violation of the  NAAQS. This value assumes that the PM2.5 concentration is  zero for the remaining portion of the sample period and therefore  represents the minimum concentration that could have been measured for  the full 24-hour sample period. Accordingly, if the value thus  calculated is high enough to be an exceedance, such an exceedance would  be a valid exceedance for the sample period. When reported to AIRS, this  data value should receive a special code to identify it as not to be  commingled with normal concentration measurements or used for other  purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Because the size and volatility of the particles making up  ambient particulate matter vary over a wide range and the mass  concentration of particles varies with particle size, it is difficult to  define the accuracy of PM2.5 measurements in an absolute  sense. The accuracy of PM2.5 measurements is therefore  defined in a relative sense, referenced to measurements provided by this  reference method. Accordingly, accuracy shall be defined as the degree  of agreement between a subject field PM2.5 sampler and a  collocated PM2.5 reference method audit sampler operating  simultaneously at the monitoring site location of the subject sampler  and includes both random (precision) and systematic (bias) errors. The  requirements for this field sampler audit procedure are set forth in  part 58, appendix A of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Measurement system bias.

According to the schedule and procedure specified in  part 58, appendix A of this chapter, a reference method sampler is  required to be located at each of selected PM2.5 SLAMS sites  as a duplicate sampler. The results from the primary sampler and the  duplicate reference method sampler are used to calculate accuracy of the  primary sampler on a quarterly basis, bias of the primary sampler on an  annual basis, and bias of a single reporting organization on an annual  basis. Reference 2 in section 13.0 of this appendix provides additional  information and guidance on these reference method audits.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Flow rate accuracy and bias. Part 58, appendix A of this chapter  requires that the flow rate accuracy and bias of individual  PM2.5 samplers used in SLAMS monitoring networks be assessed  periodically via audits of each sampler's operational flow rate. In  addition, part 58, appendix A of this chapter requires that flow rate  bias for each reference and equivalent method operated by each reporting  organization be assessed quarterly and annually.

Temperature and pressure  corrections to the flow rate indicated by the flow rate standard may be  required for certain types of flow rate standards. Calibration of the  sampler's flow rate measurement device shall consist of at least three  separate flow rate measurements (multipoint calibration) evenly spaced  within the range of -10 percent to =10 percent of the sampler's  operational flow rate, section 7.4.1 of this appendix. Verification of  the sampler's flow rate shall consist of one flow rate measurement at  the sampler's operational flow rate.

If the filter identification number is not or cannot be  marked directly on the filter, alternative means, such as a number- identified storage container, must be established to maintain positive  filter identification.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Each filter shall be conditioned in the conditioning  environment in accordance with the requirements specified in section 8.2  of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Following conditioning, each filter shall be weighed in  accordance with the requirements specified in section 8.0 of this  appendix and the presampling weight recorded with the filter  identification number.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 A numbered and preweighed filter shall be installed in the  sampler following the instructions provided in the sampler operation or  instruction manual.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 The sampler shall be checked and prepared for sample collection  in accordance with instructions provided in the sampler operation or  instruction manual and with the specific quality assurance program  established for the sampler by the user.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 The sampler's timer shall be set to start the sample collection  at the beginning of the desired sample period and stop the sample  collection 24 hours later.</p><p class="depth0">10.8 Information related to the sample collection (site location or  identification number, sample date, filter identification number, and  sampler model and serial number) shall be recorded and, if appropriate,  entered into the sampler.</p><p class="depth0">10.9 The sampler shall be allowed to collect the PM2.5  sample during the set 24-hour time period.</p><p class="depth0">10.10 Within 177 hours (7 days, 9 hours) of the end of the sample  collection period, the filter, while still contained in the filter  cassette, shall be carefully removed from the sampler, following the  procedure provided in the sampler operation or instruction manual and  the quality assurance program, and placed in a protective container. The  protective container shall contain no loose material that could be  transferred to the filter. The protective container shall hold the  filter cassette securely such that the cover shall not come in contact  with the filter's surfaces. Reference 2 in section 13.0 of this appendix  contains additional information.</p><p class="depth0">10.11 The total sample volume in actual m\3\ for the sampling period  and the elapsed sample time shall be obtained from the sampler and  recorded in accordance with the instructions provided in the sampler  operation or instruction manual. All sampler warning flag indications  and other information required by the local quality assurance program  shall also be recorded.</p><p class="depth0">10.12 All factors related to the validity or representativeness of  the sample, such as sampler tampering or malfunctions, unusual  meteorological conditions, construction activity, fires or dust storms,  etc. shall be recorded as required by the local quality assurance  program. The occurrence of a flag warning during a sample period shall  not necessarily indicate an invalid sample but rather shall indicate the  need for specific review of the QC data by a quality assurance officer  to determine sample validity.</p><p class="depth0">10.13 After retrieval from the sampler, the exposed filter  containing the PM2.5 sample should be transported to the  filter conditioning environment as soon as possible, ideally to arrive  at the conditioning environment within 24 hours for conditioning and  subsequent weighing. During the period between filter retrieval from the  sampler and the start of the conditioning, the filter shall be  maintained as cool as practical and continuously protected from exposure  to temperatures over 25 [deg]C to protect the integrity of the sample  and minimize loss of volatile components during transport and storage.  See section 8.3.6 of this appendix regarding time limits for completing  the post-sampling weighing. See reference 2 in section 13.0 of this  appendix for additional guidance on transporting filter samplers to the  conditioning and weighing laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">10.14. The exposed filter containing the PM2.5 sample  shall be re-conditioned in the conditioning environment in accordance  with the requirements specified in section 8.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">10.15. The filter shall be reweighed immediately after conditioning  in accordance with the requirements specified in section 8.0 of this  appendix, and the postsampling weight shall be recorded with the filter  identification number.</p><p class="depth0">10.16 The PM2.5 concentration shall be calculated as  specified in section 12.0 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Sampler Maintenance. The sampler shall be maintained as  described by the sampler's manufacturer in the sampler-specific  operation or instruction manual required under section 7.4.18 of this  appendix and in accordance with the specific quality assurance program  developed and established by the user based on applicable supplementary  guidance provided in reference 2 in section 13.0 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">12.0 Calculations</p><p class="depth0">12.1 (a) The PM2.5 concentration is calculated as:  PM2.5 = (Wf - Wi)/Va  where:  PM2.5 = mass concentration of PM2.5, [micro]g/</p><p class="depth0">m\3\;   Wf, Wi = final and initial weights, respectively,</p><p class="depth0">of the filter used to collect the PM2.5 particle</p><p class="depth0">sample, [micro]g; Va = total air volume sampled in actual volume units, as</p><p class="depth0">provided by the sampler, m\3\.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Total sample time must be between 1,380 and 1,500 minutes (23  and 25 hrs) for a fully valid PM2.5 sample; however, see also  section 3.3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">13.0 References.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Appendix M to Part 50 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix N to Part 50--Interpretation of the National Ambient Air</p><p class="depth0">Quality Standards for PM2.5</p><p class="depth0">1.0 General</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix explains the data handling conventions and  computations necessary for determining when the national ambient air  quality standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 are met, specifically the  primary and secondary annual and 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS  specified in Sec. 50.7, 50.13, and 50.18. PM2.5 is defined,  in general terms, as particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or  equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 mass concentrations  are measured in the ambient air by a Federal Reference Method (FRM)  based on appendix L of this part, as applicable, and designated in  accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or by a Federal Equivalent  Method (FEM) designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or  by an Approved Regional Method (ARM) designated in accordance with part  58 of this chapter. Only those FRM, FEM, and ARM measurements that are  derived in accordance with part 58 of this chapter (i.e., that are  deemed ``suitable'') shall be used in comparisons with the  PM2.5 NAAQS. The data handling and computation procedures to  be used to construct annual and 24-hour NAAQS metrics from reported  PM2.5 mass concentrations, and the associated instructions  for comparing these calculated metrics to the levels of the  PM2.5 NAAQS, are specified in sections 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 of  this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Decisions to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to the data  affected by exceptional events, including natural events, are made  according to the requirements and process deadlines specified in  Sec. Sec. 50.1, 50.14 and 51.930 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The terms used in this appendix are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Annual mean refers to a weighted arithmetic mean, based on quarterly  means, as defined in section 4.4 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">The Air Quality System (AQS) is EPA's official repository of ambient  air data.</p><p class="depth0">Collocated monitors refers to two or more air measurement  instruments for the same parameter (e.g., PM2.5 mass)  operated at the same site location, and whose placement is consistent  with Sec. 53.1 of this chapter. For purposes of considering a combined  site record in this appendix, when two or more monitors are operated at  the same site, one monitor is designated as the ``primary'' monitor with  any additional monitors designated as ``collocated.'' It is implicit in  these appendix procedures that the primary monitor and collocated  monitor(s) are all deemed suitable for the applicable NAAQS comparison;  however, it is not a requirement that the primary and monitors utilize  the same specific sampling and analysis method.</p><p class="depth0">Combined site data record is the data set used for performing  calculations in appendix N. It represents data for the primary monitors  augmented with data from collocated monitors according to the procedure  specified in section 3.0(d) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Creditable samples are daily values in the combined site record that  are given credit for data completeness. The number of creditable samples  (cn) for a given year also governs which value in the sorted series of  daily values represents the 98th percentile for that year. Creditable  samples include daily values collected on scheduled sampling days and  valid make-up samples taken for missed or invalidated samples on  scheduled sampling days.</p><p class="depth0">Daily values refer to the 24-hour average concentrations of  PM2.5 mass measured (or averaged from hourly measurements in  AQS) from midnight to midnight (local standard time) from suitable  monitors.</p><p class="depth0">Data substitution tests are diagnostic evaluations performed on an  annual PM2.5 NAAQS design value (DV) or a 24-hour  PM2.5 NAAQS DV to determine if those metrics, which are  judged to be based on incomplete data in accordance with 4.1(b) or  4.2(b) of this appendix shall nevertheless be deemed valid for NAAQS  comparisons, or alternatively, shall still be considered incomplete and  not valid for NAAQS comparisons. There are two data substitution tests,  the ``minimum quarterly value'' test and the ``maximum quarterly value''  test. Design values (DVs) are the 3-year average NAAQS metrics that are  compared to the NAAQS levels to determine when a monitoring site meets  or does not meet the NAAQS, calculated as shown in section 4. There are  two separate DVs specified in this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The 3-year average of PM2.5 annual mean mass  concentrations for each eligible monitoring site is referred to as the  ``annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The 3-year average of annual 98th percentile 24-hour average  PM2.5 mass concentration values recorded at each eligible  monitoring site is referred to as the ``24-hour (or daily) PM2.5 NAAQS  DV''.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible sites are monitoring stations that meet the criteria  specified in Sec. 58.11 and Sec. 58.30 of this chapter, and thus are  approved for comparison to the annual PM2.5 NAAQS. For the  24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, all site locations that meet the  criteria specified in Sec. 58.11 are approved (i.e., eligible) for  NAAQS comparisons.</p><p class="depth0">Extra samples are non-creditable samples. They are daily values that  do not occur on scheduled sampling days and that cannot be used as make- up samples for missed or invalidated scheduled samples. Extra samples   are used in mean calculations and are included in the series of all  daily values subject to selection as a 98th percentile value, but are  not used to determine which value in the sorted list represents the 98th  percentile.</p><p class="depth0">Make-up samples are samples collected to take the place of missed or  invalidated required scheduled samples. Make-up samples can be made by  either the primary or the collocated monitor. Make-up samples are either  taken before the next required sampling day or exactly one week after  the missed (or voided) sampling day.</p><p class="depth0">The maximum quarterly value data substitution test substitutes  actual ``high'' reported daily PM2.5 values from the same  site (specifically, the highest reported non-excluded quarterly value(s)  (year non-specific) contained in the combined site record for the  evaluated 3-year period) for missing daily values.</p><p class="depth0">The minimum quarterly value data substitution test substitutes  actual ``low'' reported daily PM2.5 values from the same site  (specifically, the lowest reported quarterly value(s) (year non- specific) contained in the combined site record for the evaluated 3-year  period) for missing daily values.</p><p class="depth0">98th percentile is the smallest daily value out of a year of  PM2.5 mass monitoring data below which no more than 98  percent of all daily values fall using the ranking and selection method  specified in section 4.5(a) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Primary monitors are suitable monitors designated by a state or  local agency in their annual network plan (and in AQS) as the default  data source for creating a combined site record for purposes of NAAQS  comparisons. If there is only one suitable monitor at a particular site  location, then it is presumed to be a primary monitor.</p><p class="depth0">Quarter refers to a calendar quarter (e.g., January through March).</p><p class="depth0">Quarterly data capture rate is the percentage of scheduled samples  in a calendar quarter that have corresponding valid reported sample  values. Quarterly data capture rates are specifically calculated as the  number of creditable samples for the quarter divided by the number of  scheduled samples for the quarter, the result then multiplied by 100 and  rounded to the nearest integer.</p><p class="depth0">Scheduled PM2.5 samples refers to those reported daily values which  are consistent with the required sampling frequency (per Sec. 58.12 of  this chapter) for the primary monitor, or those that meet the special  exception noted in section 3.0(e) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Seasonal sampling is the practice of collecting data at a reduced  frequency during a season of expected low concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">Suitable monitors are instruments that use sampling and analysis  methods approved for NAAQS comparisons. For the annual and 24-hour  PM2.5 NAAQS, suitable monitors include all FRMs, and all  FEMs/ARMs except those specific continuous FEMs/ARMs disqualified by a  particular monitoring agency network in accordance with Sec.  58.10(b)(13) and approved by the EPA Regional Administrator per Sec.  58.11(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Test design values (TDV) are numerical values that used in the data  substitution tests described in sections 4.1(c)(i), 4.1(c)(ii) and  4.2(c)(i) of this appendix to determine if the PM2.5 NAAQS DV  with incomplete data are judged to be valid for NAAQS comparisons. There  are two TDVs: TDVmin to determine if the NAAQS is not met and  is used in the ``minimum quarterly value'' data substitution test and  TDVmax to determine if the NAAQS is met and is used in the  ``maximum quarterly value'' data substitution test. These TDV's are  derived by substituting historically low or historically high daily  concentration values for missing data in an incomplete year(s).</p><p class="depth0">Year refers to a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Monitoring Considerations</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 58.30 of this chapter provides special considerations  for data comparisons to the annual PM2.5 NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Monitors meeting the network technical requirements detailed in  Sec. 58.11 of this chapter are suitable for comparison with the NAAQS  for PM2.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 58.12 of this chapter specifies the required minimum  frequency of sampling for PM2.5. Exceptions to the specified  sampling frequencies, such as seasonal sampling, are subject to the  approval of the EPA Regional Administrator and must be documented in the  state or local agency Annual Monitoring Network Plan as required in  Sec. 58.10 of this chapter and also in AQS.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Requirements for Data Use and Data Reporting for Comparisons With</p><p class="depth0">the NAAQS for PM2.5</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this appendix, all valid FRM/ FEM/ARM PM2.5 mass concentration data produced by suitable  monitors that are required to be submitted to AQS, or otherwise  available to EPA, meeting the requirements of part 58 of this chapter  including appendices A, C, and E shall be used in the DV calculations.  Generally, EPA will only use such data if they have been certified by  the reporting organization (as prescribed by Sec. 58.15 of this  chapter); however, data not certified by the reporting organization can  nevertheless be used, if the deadline for certification has passed and  EPA judges the data to be complete and accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> PM2.5 mass concentration data (typically collected  hourly for continuous instruments and daily for filter-based  instruments) shall be reported to AQS in micrograms per cubic meter  ([micro]g/m\3\) to at least one decimal place. If concentrations are  reported to one   decimal place, additional digits to the right of the tenths decimal  place shall be truncated. If concentrations are reported to AQS with  more than one decimal place, AQS will truncate the value to one decimal  place for NAAQS usage (i.e., for implementing the procedures in this  appendix). In situations where suitable PM2.5 data are  available to EPA but not reported to AQS, the same truncation protocol  shall be applied to that data. In situations where PM2.5 mass  data are submitted to AQS, or are otherwise available, with less  precision than specified above, these data shall nevertheless still be  deemed appropriate for NAAQS usage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Twenty-four-hour average concentrations will be computed in AQS  from submitted hourly PM2.5 concentration data for each  corresponding day of the year and the result will be stored in the  first, or start, hour (i.e., midnight, hour `0') of the 24-hour period.  A 24-hour average concentration shall be considered valid if at least 75  percent of the hourly averages (i.e., 18 hourly values) for the 24-hour  period are available. In the event that less than all 24 hourly average  concentrations are available (i.e., less than 24, but at least 18), the  24-hour average concentration shall be computed on the basis of the  hours available using the number of available hours within the 24-hour  period as the divisor (e.g., 19, if 19 hourly values are available).  Twenty-four-hour periods with seven or more missing hours shall also be  considered valid if, after substituting zero for all missing hourly  concentrations, the resulting 24-hour average daily value is greater  than the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS (i.e., greater than  or equal to 35.5 [micro]g/m\3\). Twenty-four hour average  PM2.5 mass concentrations that are averaged in AQS from  hourly values will be truncated to one decimal place, consistent with  the data handling procedure for the reported hourly (and also 24-hour  filter-based) data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> All calculations shown in this appendix shall be implemented on  a site-level basis. Site level concentration data shall be processed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The default dataset for PM2.5 mass concentrations for  a site shall consist of the measured concentrations recorded from the  designated primary monitor(s). All daily values produced by the primary  monitor are considered part of the site record; this includes all  creditable samples and all extra samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data for the primary monitors shall be augmented as much as  possible with data from collocated monitors. If a valid daily value is  not produced by the primary monitor for a particular day (scheduled or  otherwise), but a value is available from a collocated monitor, then  that collocated value shall be considered part of the combined site data  record. If more than one collocated daily value is available, the  average of those valid collocated values shall be used as the daily  value. The data record resulting from this procedure is referred to as  the ``combined site data record.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> All daily values in a combined site data record are used in the  calculations specified in this appendix; however, not all daily values  are given credit towards data completeness requirements. Only creditable  samples are given credit for data completeness. Creditable samples  include daily values in the combined site record that are collected on  scheduled sampling days and valid make-up samples taken for missed or  invalidated samples on scheduled sampling days. Days are considered  scheduled according to the required sampling frequency of the designated  primary monitor with one exception. The exception is, if a collocated  continuous FEM/ARM monitor has a more intensive sampling frequency than  the primary FRM monitor, then samples contributed to the combined site  record from that continuous FEM/ARM monitor are always considered  scheduled and, hence, also creditable. Daily values in the combined site  data record that are reported for nonscheduled days, but that are not  valid make-up samples are referred to as extra samples.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Comparisons With the Annual and 24-Hour PM2.5 NAAQS</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Annual PM2.5 NAAQS</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The primary annual PM2.5 NAAQS is met when the annual  PM2.5 NAAQS DV is less than or equal to 12.0 [micro]g/m\3\ at  each eligible monitoring site. The secondary annual PM2.5  NAAQS is met when the annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV is less than or  equal to 15.0 [micro]g/m\3\ at each eligible monitoring site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Three years of valid annual means are required to produce a  valid annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV. A year meets data completeness  requirements when quarterly data capture rates for all four quarters are  at least 75 percent. However, years with at least 11 creditable samples  in each quarter shall also be considered valid if the resulting annual  mean or resulting annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV (rounded according to  the conventions of section 4.3 of this appendix) is greater than the  level of the applicable primary or secondary annual PM2.5  NAAQS. Furthermore, where the explicit 75 percent data capture and/or 11  sample minimum requirements are not met, the 3-year annual  PM2.5 NAAQS DV shall still be considered valid if it passes  at least one of the two data substitution tests stipulated below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(ii)</em> of this  appendix is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV that is above the level of  the NAAQS can be validated if it passes the minimum quarterly value data  substitution test. This type of data substitution is permitted only if  there are at least 30 days across the three quarters of the three years  under consideration (e.g., collectively, quarter 1 of year 1, quarter 1  of year 2 and quarter 1 of year 3) from which to select the quarter- specific low value. Data substitution will be performed in all quarter  periods that have less than 11 creditable samples.</p><p class="depth0">Procedure: Identify for each deficient quarter (i.e., those with  less than 11 creditable samples) the lowest reported daily value for  that quarter, looking across those three months of all three years under  consideration. If after substituting the lowest reported daily value for  a quarter for (11- cn) daily values in the matching deficient quarter(s)  (i.e., to bring the creditable number for those quarters up to 11), the  procedure yields a recalculated annual PM2.5 NAAQS test DV  (TDVmin) that is greater than the level of the standard, then  the annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV is deemed to have passed the  diagnostic test and is valid, and the annual PM2.5 NAAQS is  deemed to have been violated in that 3-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV that is equal to or below  the level of the NAAQS can be validated if it passes the maximum  quarterly value data substitution test. This type of data substitution  is permitted only if there is at least 50 percent data capture in each  quarter that is deficient of 75 percent data capture in each of the  three years under consideration. Data substitution will be performed in  all quarter periods that have less than 75 percent data capture but at  least 50 percent data capture. If any quarter has less than 50 percent  data capture then this substitution test cannot be used.</p><p class="depth0">Procedure: Identify for each deficient quarter (i.e., those with  less than 75 percent but at least 50 percent data capture) the highest  reported daily value for that quarter, excluding state-flagged data  affected by exceptional events which have been approved for exclusion by  the Administrator, looking across those three quarters of all three  years under consideration. If after substituting the highest reported  daily PM2.5 value for a quarter for all missing daily data in  the matching deficient quarter(s) (i.e., to make those quarters 100  percent complete), the procedure yields a recalculated annual  PM2.5 NAAQS test DV (TDVmax) that is less than or  equal to the level of the standard, then the annual PM2.5  NAAQS DV is deemed to have passed the diagnostic test and is valid, and  the annual PM2.5 NAAQS is deemed to have been met in that 3- year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An annual PM2.5 NAAQS DV based on data that do not  meet the completeness criteria stated in 4(b) and also do not satisfy  the test conditions specified in section 4(c), may also be considered  valid with the approval of, or at the initiative of, the EPA  Administrator, who may consider factors such as monitoring site  closures/moves, monitoring diligence, the consistency and levels of the  daily values that are available, and nearby concentrations in  determining whether to use such data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The equations for calculating the annual PM2.5 NAAQS  DVs are given in section 4.4 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Twenty-four-hour PM2.5 NAAQS</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The primary and secondary 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS are met  when the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS DV at each eligible monitoring  site is less than or equal to 35 [micro]g/m\3\.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Three years of valid annual PM2.5 98th percentile  mass concentrations are required to produce a valid 24-hour  PM2.5 NAAQS DV. A year meets data completeness requirements  when quarterly data capture rates for all four quarters are at least 75  percent.

The air samplers and other aspects of this PM10-2.5  reference method are specified either explicitly in this appendix or by  reference to other applicable regulations or quality assurance guidance.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Each PM10c and PM2.5 sample collection  filter is weighed (after moisture and temperature conditioning) before  and after sample collection to determine the net weight (mass) gain due  to collected PM10c or PM2.5. The total volume of  air sampled by each sampler is determined by the sampler from the  measured flow rate at local ambient temperature and pressure and the  sampling time. The mass concentrations of both PM10c and  PM2.5 in the ambient air are computed as the total mass of  collected particles in the PM10 or PM2.5 size  range, as appropriate, divided by the total volume of air sampled by the  respective samplers, and expressed in micrograms per cubic meter  ([micro]g/m\3\)at local temperature and pressure conditions. The mass  concentration of PM10-2.5 is determined as the  PM10c concentration value less the corresponding,  concurrently measured PM2.5 concentration value.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Most requirements for PM10-2.5 reference methods are  similar or identical to the requirements for PM2.5 reference  methods as set forth in appendix L to this part.

The lower detection limit of the mass  concentration measurement range is estimated to be approximately 3  [micro]g/m\3\, based on the observed precision of PM2.5  measurements in the national PM2.5 monitoring network, the  probable similar level of precision for the matched PM10c  measurements, and the additional variability arising from the  differential nature of the measurement process. This value is provided  merely as a guide to the significance of low PM10-2.5  concentration measurements.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Upper concentration limit. The upper limit of the mass  concentration range is determined principally by the PM10c  filter mass loading beyond which the sampler can no longer maintain the  operating flow rate within specified limits due to increased pressure  drop across the loaded filter. This upper limit cannot be specified  precisely because it is a complex function of the ambient particle size  distribution and type, humidity, the individual filter used, the  capacity of the sampler flow rate control system, and perhaps other  factors. All PM10c samplers are estimated to be capable of  measuring 24-hour mass concentrations of at least 200 [micro]g/m\3\  while maintaining the operating flow rate within the specified limits.  The upper limit for the PM10-2.5 measurement is likely to be  somewhat lower because the PM10-2.5 concentration represents  only a fraction of the PM10 concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Sample period. The required sample period for  PM10-2.5 concentration measurements by this method shall be  at least 1,380 minutes but not more than 1,500 minutes (23 to 25 hours),  and the start times of the PM2.5 and PM10c samples  are within 10 minutes and the stop times of the samples are also within  10 minutes (see section 10.4 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Accuracy (bias)</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Because the size, density, and volatility of the particles  making up ambient particulate matter vary over wide ranges and the mass  concentration of particles varies with particle size, it is difficult to  define the accuracy of PM10-2.5 measurements in an absolute  sense. Furthermore, generation of credible PM10-2.5  concentration standards at field monitoring sites and presenting or  introducing such standards reliably to samplers or monitors to assess  accuracy is still generally impractical. The accuracy of  PM10-2.5 measurements is therefore defined in a relative  sense as bias, referenced to measurements provided by other reference  method samplers or based on flow rate verification audits or checks, or  on other performance evaluation procedures.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Measurement system bias for monitoring data is assessed  according to the procedures and schedule set forth in part 58, appendix  A of this chapter.

Data reporting, data handling, and computation procedures to be  used in making comparisons between reported O3 concentrations  and the levels of the O3 standards are specified in the  following sections. Whether to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to  the data affected by exceptional events, including stratospheric  O3 intrusion and other natural events, is determined by the  requirements under Sec.

This process is repeated, yielding a daily maximum 8-hour average  O3 concentration for each calendar day with ambient  O3 monitoring data. Because the 8-hour averages are recorded  in the start hour, the daily maximum 8-hour concentrations from two  consecutive days may have some hourly concentrations in common.

Appendix Q to Part 50--Reference Method for the Determination of  Lead in Particulate Matter as PM10 Collected From Ambient Air</p><p class="depth0">This Federal Reference Method (FRM) draws heavily from the specific  analytical protocols used by the U.S. EPA.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability and Principle</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method provides for the measurement of the lead (Pb)  concentration in particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or less  (PM10) in ambient air. PM10 is collected on an  acceptable (see section 6.1.2) 46.2 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE) filter for 24 hours using active sampling at local conditions  with a low-volume air sampler. The low-volume sampler has an average  flow rate of 16.7 liters per minute (Lpm) and total sampled volume of 24  cubic meters (m\3\) of air. The analysis of Pb in PM10 is  performed on each individual 24-hour sample. Gravimetric mass analysis  of PM10c filters is not required for Pb analysis. For the  purpose of this method, PM10 is defined as particulate matter  having an aerodynamic diameter in the nominal range of 10 micrometers  (10 [micro]m) or less.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 For this reference method, PM10 shall be collected  with the PM10c federal reference method (FRM) sampler as  described in appendix O to Part 50 using the same sample period,  measurement procedures, and requirements specified in appendix L of Part  50. The PM10c sampler is also being used for measurement of  PM10-2.5 mass by difference and as such, the PM10c  sampler must also meet all of the performance requirements specified for  PM2.5 in appendix L. The concentration of Pb in the  atmosphere is determined in the total volume of air sampled and  expressed in micrograms per cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\) at local  temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The FRM will serve as the basis for approving Federal Equivalent  Methods (FEMs) as specified in 40 CFR Part 53 (Reference and Equivalent  Methods). This FRM specifically applies to the analysis of Pb in  PM10 filters collected with the PM10c sampler. If  these filters are analyzed for elements other than Pb, then refer to the  guidance provided in the EPA Inorganic Compendium Method IO-3.3  (Reference 1 of section 8) for multi-element analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The PM10c air sampler draws ambient air at a constant  volumetric flow rate into a specially shaped inlet and through an  inertial particle size separator, where the suspended particulate matter  in the PM10 size range is separated for collection on a PTFE  filter over the specified sampling period. The Pb content of the  PM10 sample is analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray  fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence  spectrometry provides a means for identification of an element by  measurement of its characteristic X-ray emission energy. The method  allows for quantification of the element by measuring the intensity of  X-rays emitted at the characteristic photon energy and then relating  this intensity to the elemental concentration. The number or intensity  of X-rays produced at a given energy provides a measure of the amount of  the element present by comparisons with calibration standards. The X- rays are detected and the spectral signals are acquired and processed  with a personal computer. EDXRF is commonly used as a non-destructive  method for quantifying trace elements in PM. A detailed explanation of  quantitative X-ray spectrometry is described in references 2, 3 and 4.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Quality assurance (QA) procedures for the collection of  monitoring data are contained in Part 58, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">2. PM10Pb Measurement Range and Detection Limit. The values given  below in section 2.1 and 2.2 are typical of the method capabilities.  Absolute values will vary for individual situations depending on the  instrument, detector age, and operating conditions used. Data are  typically reported in ng/m\3\ for ambient air samples; however, for this  reference method, data will be reported in [micro]g/m\3\ at local  temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 EDXRF Pb Measurement Range. The typical ambient air measurement  range is 0.001 to 30 [micro]g Pb/m\3\, assuming an upper range  calibration standard of about 60 [micro]g Pb per square centimeter  (cm\2\), a filter deposit area of 11.86 cm\2\, and an air volume of 24  m\3\. The top range of the EDXRF instrument is much greater than what is  stated here. The top measurement range of quantification is defined by  the level of the high concentration calibration standard used and can be  increased to expand the measurement range as needed.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Detection Limit (DL). A typical estimate of the one-sigma  detection limit (DL) is about 2 ng Pb/cm\2\ or 0.001 [micro]g Pb/m\3\,  assuming a filter size of 46.2 mm (filter deposit   area of 11.86 cm\2\) and a sample air volume of 24 m\3\. The DL is an  estimate of the lowest amount of Pb that can be reliably distinguished  from a blank filter. The one-sigma detection limit for Pb is calculated  as the average overall uncertainty or propagated error for Pb,  determined from measurements on a series of blank filters from the  filter lot(s) in use. Detection limits must be determined for each  filter lot in use. If a new filter lot is used, then a new DL must be  determined. The sources of random error which are considered are  calibration uncertainty; system stability; peak and background counting  statistics; uncertainty in attenuation corrections; and uncertainty in  peak overlap corrections, but the dominating source by far is peak and  background counting statistics. At a minimum, laboratories are to  determine annual estimates of the DL using the guidance provided in  Reference 5.</p><p class="depth0">3. Factors Affecting Bias and Precision of Lead Determination by  EDXRF</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Filter Deposit. X-ray spectra are subject to distortion if  unusually heavy deposits are analyzed. This is the result of internal  absorption of both primary and secondary X-rays within the sample;  however, this is not an issue for Pb due to the energetic X-rays used to  fluoresce Pb and the energetic characteristic X-rays emitted by Pb. The  optimum mass filter loading for multi-elemental EDXRF analyis is about  100 [micro]g/cm\2\ or 1.2 mg/filter for a 46.2-mm filter. Too little  deposit material can also be problematic due to low counting statistics  and signal noise. The particle mass deposit should minimally be 15  [micro]g/cm\2\. The maximum PM10 filter loading or upper  concentration limit of mass expected to be collected by the  PM10c sampler is 200 [micro]g/m\3\ (Appendix O to Part 50,  Section 3.2). This equates to a mass loading of about 400 [micro]g/cm\2\  and is the maximum expected loading for PM10c filters. This  maximum loading is acceptable for the analysis of Pb and other high-Z  elements with very energetic characteristic X-rays. A properly collected  sample will have a uniform deposit over the entire collection area.  Samples with physical deformities (including a visually non-uniform  deposit area) should not be quantitatively analyzed. Tests on the  uniformity of particle deposition on PM10C filters showed  that the non-uniformity of the filter deposit represents a small  fraction of the overall uncertainty in ambient Pb concentration  measurement. The analysis beam of the XRF analyzer does not cover the  entire filter collection area. The minimum allowable beam size is 10 mm.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Spectral Interferences and Spectral Overlap. Spectral  interference occurs when the entirety of the analyte spectral lines of  two species are nearly 100% overlapped. The presence of arsenic (As) is  a problematic interference for EDXRF systems which use the Pb L[alpha]  line exclusively to quantify the Pb concentration. This is because the  Pb L[alpha] line and the As K[alpha] lines severely overlap. The use of  multiple Pb lines, including the L[beta] and/or the L[gamma] lines for  quantification must be used to reduce the uncertainty in the Pb  determination in the presence of As. There can be instances when lines  partially overlap the Pb spectral lines, but with the energy resolution  of most detectors these overlaps are typically de-convoluted using  standard spectral de-convolution software provided by the instrument  vendor. An EDXRF protocol for Pb must define which Pb lines are used for  quantification and where spectral overlaps occur. A de-convolution  protocol must be used to separate all the lines which overlap with Pb.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Particle Size Effects and Attenuation Correction Factors. X-ray  attenuation is dependent on the X-ray energy, mass sample loading,  composition, and particle size. In some cases, the excitation and  fluorescent X-rays are attenuated as they pass through the sample. In  order to relate the measured intensity of the X-rays to the thin-film  calibration standards used, the magnitude of any attenuation present  must be corrected for. See references 6, 7, and 8 for more discussion on  this issue. Essentially no attenuation corrections are necessary for Pb  in PM10: Both the incoming excitation X-rays used for  analyzing lead and the fluoresced Pb X-rays are sufficiently energetic  that for particles in this size range and for normal filter loadings,  the Pb X-ray yield is not significantly impacted by attenuation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Precision</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Measurement system precision is assessed according to the  procedures set forth in appendix A to part 58. Measurement method  precision is assessed from collocated sampling and analysis. The goal  for acceptable measurement uncertainty, as precision, is defined as an  upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV)  of 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5. Bias</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Measurement system bias for monitoring data is assessed  according to the procedures set forth in appendix A of part 58. The bias  is assessed through an audit using spiked filters. The goal for  measurement bias is defined as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for  the absolute bias of 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0">6. Measurement of PTFE Filters by EDXRF</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Sampling</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Low-Volume PM10cSampler. The low-volume PM10c  sampler shall be used for PM10 sample collection and operated  in accordance with the performance specifications described in part 50,  appendix L.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 PTFE Filters and Filter Acceptance Testing. The PTFE filters  used for PM10c sample collection shall meet the  specifications provided in part 50, appendix L. The following  requirements are similar to those   currently specified for the acceptance of PM2.5 filters that  are tested for trace elements by EDXRF. For large filter lots (greater  than 500 filters) randomly select 20 filters from a given lot. For small  lots (less than 500 filters) a lesser number of filters may be taken.  Analyze each blank filter separately and calculate the average lead  concentration in ng/cm\2\. Ninety percent, or 18 of the 20 filters, must  have an average lead concentration that is less than 4.8 ng Pb/cm\2\.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2.1 Filter Blanks. Field blank filters shall be collected along  with routine samples. Field blank filters will be collected that are  transported to the sampling site and placed in the sampler for the  duration of sampling without sampling. Laboratory blank filters from  each filter lot used shall be analyzed with each batch of routine sample  filters analyzed. Laboratory blank filters are used in background  subtraction as discussed below in Section 6.2.4.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Analysis. The four main categories of random and systematic  error encountered in X-ray fluorescence analysis include errors from  sample collection, the X-ray source, the counting process, and inter- element effects. These errors are addressed through the calibration  process and mathematical corrections in the instrument software.  Spectral processing methods are well established and most commercial  analyzers have software that can implement the most common approaches  (references 9-11) to background subtraction, peak overlap correction,  counting and deadtime corrections.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 EDXRF Analysis Instrument. An energy-dispersive XRF system is  used. Energy-dispersive XRF systems are available from a number of  commercial vendors. Examples include Thermo (www.thermo.com), Spectro  (http://www.spectro.com), Xenemetrix (http://www.xenemetrix.com) and  PANalytical (http://www.panalytical.com). \1\ The analysis is performed  at room temperature in either vacuum or in a helium atmosphere. The  specific details of the corrections and calibration algorithms are  typically included in commercial analytical instrument software routines  for automated spectral acquisition and processing and vary by  manufacturer. It is important for the analyst to understand the  correction procedures and algorithms of the particular system used, to  ensure that the necessary corrections are applied. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ These are examples of available systems and is not an all  inclusive list. The mention of commercial products does not imply  endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 Thin film standards. Thin film standards are used for  calibration because they most closely resemble the layer of particles on  a filter. Thin films standards are typically deposited on Nuclepore  substrates. The preparation of thin film standards is discussed in  reference 8, and 10. The NIST SRM 2783 (Air Particulate on Filter Media)  is currently available on polycarbonate filters and contains a certified  concentration for Pb. Thin film standards at 15 and 50 [micro]g/cm\2\  are commercially available from MicroMatter Inc. (Arlington, WA).</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 Filter Preparation. Filters used for sample collection are  46.2-mm PTFE filters with a pore size of 2 microns and filter deposit  area 11.86 cm\2\. Cold storage is not a requirement for filters analyzed  for Pb; however, if filters scheduled for XRF analysis were stored cold,  they must be allowed to reach room temperature prior to analysis. All  filter samples received for analysis are checked for any holes, tears,  or a non-uniform deposit which would prevent quantitative analysis.  Samples with physical deformities are not quantitatively analyzable. The  filters are carefully removed with tweezers from the Petri dish and  securely placed into the instrument-specific sampler holder for  analysis. Care must be taken to protect filters from contamination prior  to analysis. Filters must be kept covered when not being analyzed. No  other preparation of filter samples is required.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4 Calibration. In general, calibration determines each element's  sensitivity, i.e., its response in x-ray counts/sec to each [micro]g/ cm\2\ of a standard and an interference coefficient for each element  that causes interference with another one (See section 3.2 above). The  sensitivity can be determined by a linear plot of count rate versus  concentration ([micro]g/cm\2\) in which the slope is the instrument's  sensitivity for that element. A more precise way, which requires fewer  standards, is to fit sensitivity versus atomic number. Calibration is a  complex task in the operation of an XRF system. Two major functions  accomplished by calibration are the production of reference spectra  which are used for fitting and the determination of the elemental  sensitivities. Included in the reference spectra (referred to as  ``shapes'') are background-subtracted peak shapes of the elements to be  analyzed (as well as interfering elements) and spectral backgrounds.  Pure element thin film standards are used for the element peak shapes  and clean filter blanks from the same lot as routine filter samples are  used for the background. The analysis of Pb in PM filter deposits is  based on the assumption that the thickness of the deposit is small with  respect to the characteristic Pb X-ray transmission thickness.  Therefore, the concentration of Pb in a sample is determined by first  calibrating the spectrometer with thin film standards to determine the  sensitivity factor for Pb and then analyzing the unknown samples under  identical excitation conditions as used to determine the calibration.  Calibration shall be   performed annually or when significant repairs or changes occur (e.g., a  change in fluorescers, X-ray tubes, or detector). Calibration  establishes the elemental sensitivity factors and the magnitude of  interference or overlap coefficients. See reference 7 for more detailed  discussion of calibration and analysis of shapes standards for  background correction, coarse particle absorption corrections, and  spectral overlap.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4.1 Spectral Peak Fitting. The EPA uses a library of pure  element peak shapes (shape standards) to extract the elemental  background-free peak areas from an unknown spectrum. It is also possible  to fit spectra using peak stripping or analytically defined functions  such as modified Gaussian functions. The EPA shape standards are  generated from pure, mono-elemental thin film standards. The shape  standards are acquired for sufficiently long times to provide a large  number of counts in the peaks of interest. It is not necessary for the  concentration of the standard to be known. A slight contaminant in the  region of interest in a shape standard can have a significant and  serious effect on the ability of the least squares fitting algorithm to  fit the shapes to the unknown spectrum. It is these elemental peak  shapes that are fitted to the peaks in an unknown sample during spectral  processing by the analyzer. In addition to this library of elemental  shapes there is also a background shape spectrum for the filter type  used as discussed below in section 6.2.4.2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4.2 Background Measurement and Correction. A background spectrum  generated by the filter itself must be subtracted from the X-ray  spectrum prior to extracting peak areas. Background spectra must be  obtained for each filter lot used for sample collection. The background  shape standards which are used for background fitting are created at the  time of calibration. If a new lot of filters is used, new background  spectra must be obtained. A minimum of 20 clean blank filters from each  filter lot are kept in a sealed container and are used exclusively for  background measurement and correction. The spectra acquired on  individual blank filters are added together to produce a single spectrum  for each of the secondary targets or fluorescers used in the analysis of  lead. Individual blank filter spectra which show atypical contamination  are excluded from the summed spectra. The summed spectra are fitted to  the appropriate background during spectral processing. Background  correction is automatically included during spectral processing of each  sample.</p><p class="depth0">7. Calculation.</p><p class="depth0">7.1 PM10 Pb concentrations.

General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix explains the data handling conventions and  computations necessary for determining when the primary and secondary  national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for lead (Pb) specified  in Sec. 50.16 are met. The NAAQS indicator for Pb is defined as: lead  and its compounds, measured as elemental lead in total suspended  particulate (Pb-TSP), sampled and analyzed by a Federal reference method  (FRM) based on appendix G to this part or by a Federal equivalent method  (FEM) designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter. Although  Pb-TSP is the lead NAAQS indicator, surrogate Pb-TSP concentrations  shall also be used for NAAQS comparisons; specifically, valid surrogate  Pb-TSP data are concentration data for lead and its compounds, measured  as elemental lead, in particles with an aerodynamic size of 10 microns  or less (Pb-PM10), sampled and analyzed by an FRM based on  appendix Q to this part or by an FEM designated in accordance with part  53 of this chapter. Surrogate Pb-TSP data (i.e., Pb-PM10  data), however, can only be used to show that the Pb NAAQS were violated  (i.e., not met); they can not be used to demonstrate that the Pb NAAQS  were met. Pb-PM10 data used as surrogate Pb-TSP data shall be  processed at face value; that is, without any transformation or scaling.  Data handling and computation procedures to be used in making  comparisons between reported and/or surrogate Pb-TSP concentrations and  the level of the Pb NAAQS are specified in the following sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whether to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to the data  affected by exceptional events, including natural events, is determined  by the requirements and process deadlines specified in Sec. Sec. 50.1,  50.14, and 51.930 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The terms used in this appendix are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Annual monitoring network plan refers to the plan required by  section 58.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Creditable samples are samples that are given credit for data  completeness. They include valid samples collected on required sampling  days and valid ``make-up'' samples taken for missed or invalidated  samples on required sampling days.</p><p class="depth0">Daily values for Pb refer to the 24-hour mean concentrations of Pb  (Pb-TSP or Pb-PM10), measured from midnight to midnight  (local standard time), that are used in NAAQS computations.</p><p class="depth0">Design value is the site-level metric (i.e., statistic) that is  compared to the NAAQS level to determine compliance; the design value  for the Pb NAAQS is selected according to the procedures in this  appendix from among the valid three-month Pb-TSP and surrogate Pb-TSP  (Pb-PM10) arithmetic mean concentration for the 38-month  period consisting of the most recent 3-year calendar period plus two  previous months (i.e., 36 3-month periods) using the last month of each  3-month period as the period of report.</p><p class="depth0">Extra samples are non-creditable samples. They are daily values that  do not occur on scheduled sampling days and that can not be used as  ``make-up samples'' for missed or invalidated scheduled samples. Extra  samples are used in mean calculations. For purposes of determining  whether a sample must be treated as a make-up sample or an extra sample,  Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 data collected before January 1, 2009 will  be treated with an assumed scheduled sampling frequency of every sixth  day.</p><p class="depth0">Make-up samples are samples taken to replace missed or invalidated  required scheduled samples. Make-ups can be made by either the primary  or collocated (same size fraction) instruments; to be considered a   valid make-up, the sampling must be conducted with equipment and  procedures that meet the requirements for scheduled sampling. Make-up  samples are either taken before the next required sampling day or  exactly one week after the missed (or voided) sampling day. Make-up  samples can not span years; that is, if a scheduled sample for December  is missed (or voided), it can not be made up in January. Make-up  samples, however, may span months, for example a missed sample on  January 31 may be made up on February 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7 (with an  assumed sampling frequency of every sixth day). Section 3(e) explains  how such month-spanning make-up samples are to be treated for purposes  of data completeness and mean calculations. Only two make-up samples are  permitted each calendar month; these are counted according to the month  in which the miss and not the makeup occurred. For purposes of  determining whether a sample must be treated as a make-up sample or an  extra sample, Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 data collected before  January 1, 2009 will be treated with an assumed scheduled sampling  frequency of every sixth day.</p><p class="depth0">Monthly mean refers to an arithmetic mean, calculated as specified  in section 6(a) of this appendix. Monthly means are computed at each  monitoring site separately for Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 (i.e., by  site-parameter-year-month).</p><p class="depth0">Parameter refers either to Pb-TSP or to Pb-PM10.</p><p class="depth0">Pollutant Occurrence Code (POC) refers to a numerical code (1, 2, 3,  etc.) used to distinguish the data from two or more monitors for the  same parameter at a single monitoring site.</p><p class="depth0">Scheduled sampling day means a day on which sampling is scheduled  based on the required sampling frequency for the monitoring site, as  provided in section 58.12 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Three-month means are arithmetic averages of three consecutive  monthly means. Three-month means are computed on a rolling, overlapping  basis. Each distinct monthly mean will be included in three different 3- month means; for example, in a given year, a November mean would be  included in: (1) The September-October-November 3-month mean, (2) the  October-November-December 3-month mean, and (3) the November-December- January(of the following year) 3-month mean. Three-month means are  computed separately for each parameter per section 6(a) (and are  referred to as 3-month parameter means) and are validated according to  the criteria specified in section 4(c). The parameter-specific 3-month  means are then prioritized according to section 2(a) to determine a  single 3-month site mean.</p><p class="depth0">Year refers to a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of Pb-PM10 Data as Surrogate Pb-TSP Data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As stipulated in section 2.10 of Appendix C to 40 CFR part 58,  at some mandatory Pb monitoring locations, monitoring agencies are  required to sample for Pb as Pb-TSP, and at other mandatory Pb  monitoring sites, monitoring agencies are permitted to monitor for Pb- PM10 in lieu of Pb-TSP. In either situation, valid collocated  Pb data for the other parameter may be produced. Additionally, there may  be non-required monitoring locations that also produce valid Pb-TSP and/ or valid Pb-PM10 data. Pb-TSP data and Pb-PM10  data are always processed separately when computing monthly and 3-month  parameter means; monthly and 3-month parameter means are validated  according to the criteria stated in section 4 of this appendix. Three- month ``site'' means, which are the final valid 3-month mean from which  a design value is identified, are determined from the one or two  available valid 3-month parameter means according to the following  prioritization which applies to all Pb monitoring locations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a valid 3-month Pb-PM10 mean shows a  violation and either is greater than a corresponding (collocated) 3- month Pb-TSP mean or there is no corresponding valid 3-month Pb-TSP mean  present, then that 3-month Pb-PM10 mean will be the site- level mean for that (site's) 3-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise (i.e., there is no valid violating 3-month Pb- PM10 that exceeds a corresponding 3-month Pb-TSP mean),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a valid 3-month Pb-TSP mean exists, then it will be the site- level mean for that (site's) 3-month period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a valid 3-month Pb-TSP mean does not exist, then there is no  valid 3-month site mean for that period (even if a valid non-violating  3-month Pb-PM10 mean exists).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As noted in section 1(a) of this appendix, FRM/FEM Pb- PM10 data will be processed at face value (i.e., at reported  concentrations) without adjustment when computing means and making NAAQS  comparisons.</p><p class="depth0">3. Requirements for Data Used for Comparisons With the Pb NAAQS and  Data Reporting Considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All valid FRM/FEM Pb-TSP data and all valid FRM/FEM Pb- PM10 data submitted to EPA's Air Quality System (AQS), or  otherwise available to EPA, meeting the requirements of part 58 of this  chapter including appendices A, C, and E shall be used in design value  calculations. Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 data representing sample  collection periods prior to January 1, 2009 (i.e., ``pre-rule'' data)  will also be considered valid for NAAQS comparisons and related  attainment/nonattainment determinations if the sampling and analysis  methods that were utilized to collect that data were consistent with  previous or newly designated FRMs or FEMs and with either the provisions  of part 58 of this chapter including appendices A, C,   and E that were in effect at the time of original sampling or that are  in effect at the time of the attainment/nonattainment determination, and  if such data are submitted to AQS prior to September 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 measurement data are reported to  AQS in units of micrograms per cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\) at local  conditions (local temperature and pressure, LC) to three decimal places;  any additional digits to the right of the third decimal place are  truncated. Pre-rule Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 concentration data  that were reported in standard conditions (standard temperature and  standard pressure, STP) will not require a conversion to local  conditions but rather, after truncating to three decimal places and  processing as stated in this appendix, shall be compared ``as is'' to  the NAAQS (i.e., the LC to STP conversion factor will be assumed to be  one). However, if the monitoring agency has retroactively resubmitted  Pb-TSP or Pb-PM10 pre-rule data converted from STP to LC  based on suitable meteorological data, only the LC data will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> At each monitoring location (site), Pb-TSP and Pb- PM10 data are to be processed separately when selecting daily  data by day (as specified in section 3(d) of this appendix), when  aggregating daily data by month (per section 6(a)), and when forming 3- month means (per section 6(b)). However, when deriving (i.e.,  identifying) the design value for the 38-month period, 3-month means for  the two data types may be considered together; see sections 2(a) and  4(e) of this appendix for details.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Daily values for sites will be selected for a site on a size cut  (Pb-TSP or Pb-PM10, i.e., ``parameter'') basis; Pb-TSP  concentrations and Pb-PM10 concentrations shall not be  commingled in these determinations. Site level, parameter-specific daily  values will be selected as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The starting dataset for a site-parameter shall consist of the  measured daily concentrations recorded from the designated primary FRM/ FEM monitor for that parameter. The primary monitor for each parameter  shall be designated in the appropriate state or local agency annual  Monitoring Network Plan. If no primary monitor is designated, the  Administrator will select which monitor to treat as primary. All daily  values produced by the primary sampler are considered part of the site- parameter data record (i.e., that site-parameter's set of daily values);  this includes all creditable samples and all extra samples. For pre-rule  Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 data, valid data records present in AQS  for the monitor with the lowest occurring Pollutant Occurrence Code  (POC), as selected on a site-parameter-daily basis, will constitute the  site-parameter data record. Where pre-rule Pb-TSP data (or subsequent  non-required Pb-TSP or Pb-PM10 data) are reported in  ``composite'' form (i.e., multiple filters for a month of sampling that  are analyzed together), the composite concentration will be used as the  site-parameter monthly mean concentration if there are no valid daily  Pb-TSP data reported for that month with a lower POC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Data for the primary monitor for each parameter shall be  augmented as much as possible with data from collocated (same parameter)  FRM/FEM monitors. If a valid 24-hour measurement is not produced from  the primary monitor for a particular day (scheduled or otherwise), but a  valid sample is generated by a collocated (same parameter) FRM/FEM  instrument, then that collocated value shall be considered part of the  site-parameter data record (i.e., that site-parameter's monthly set of  daily values). If more than one valid collocated FRM/FEM value is  available, the mean of those valid collocated values shall be used as  the daily value. Note that this step will not be necessary for pre-rule  data given the daily identification presumption for the primary monitor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> All daily values in the composite site-parameter record are used  in monthly mean calculations. However, not all daily values are given  credit towards data completeness requirements. Only ``creditable''  samples are given credit for data completeness. Creditable samples  include valid samples on scheduled sampling days and valid make-up  samples. All other types of daily values are referred to as ``extra''  samples. Make-up samples taken in the (first week of the) month after  the one in which the miss/void occurred will be credited for data  capture in the month of the miss/void but will be included in the month  actually taken when computing monthly means. For example, if a make-up  sample was taken in February to replace a missed sample scheduled for  January, the make-up concentration would be included in the February  monthly mean but the sample credited in the January data capture rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Comparisons With the Pb NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Pb NAAQS is met at a monitoring site when the identified  design value is valid and less than or equal to 0.15 micrograms per  cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\). A Pb design value that meets the NAAQS  (i.e., 0.15 [micro]g/m\3\ or less), is considered valid if it  encompasses 36 consecutive valid 3-month site means (specifically for a  3-year calendar period and the two previous months). For sites that  begin monitoring Pb after this rule is effective but before January 15,  2010 (or January 15, 2011), a 2010-2012 (or 2011-2013) Pb design value  that meets the NAAQS will be considered valid if it encompasses at least  34 consecutive valid 3-month means (specifically encompassing only the  3-year calendar period). See 4(c) of this appendix for the description  of a valid 3-month mean and section 6(d) for the definition of the  design value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Pb NAAQS is violated at a monitoring site when the  identified design value is valid and is greater than 0.15 [micro]g/m\3\,  no matter whether determined from Pb-TSP or Pb-PM10 data. A  Pb design value greater than 0.15 [micro]g/m\3\ is valid no matter how  many valid 3-month means in the 3-year period it encompasses; that is, a  violating design value is valid even if it (i.e., the highest 3-month  mean) is the only valid 3-month mean in the 3-year timeframe. Further, a  site does not have to monitor for three full calendar years in order to  have a valid violating design value; a site could monitor just three  months and still produce a valid (violating) design value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 daily values are  processed separately when calculating monthly means and data capture  rates; a Pb-TSP value cannot be used as a make-up for a missing Pb- PM10 value or vice versa. For purposes of assessing data  capture, Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10 data collected before January 1,  2009 will be treated with an assumed scheduled sampling frequency of  every sixth day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B))</em> is not considered the actual 3-month parameter mean and  shall not be used in the determination of design values. For both types  of data substitution, substitution is permitted only if there are  available data points from which to identify the high or low 3-year  month-specific values, specifically if there are at least 10 data points  total from at least two of the three (or four for November and December)  possible year-months. Data substitution may only use data of the same  parameter type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The ``above NAAQS level'' test is as follows: Data substitution  will be done in each month of the 3-month period that has less than 75  percent data capture; monthly capture rates are temporarily rounded to  integers (zero decimals) for this evaluation. If by substituting the  lowest reported daily value for that month (year non-specific; e.g., for  January) over the 38-month design value period in question for missing  scheduled data in the deficient months (substituting only enough to meet  the 75 percent data capture minimum), the computation yields a  recalculated test 3-month parameter mean concentration above the level  of the standard, then the 3-month period is deemed to have passed the  diagnostic test and the level of the standard is deemed to have been  exceeded in that 3-month period. As noted in section 4(c)(ii), in such a  case, the 3-month parameter mean of the data actually reported, not the  recalculated (``test'') result including the low values, shall be used  to determine the design value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ``below NAAQS level'' test is as follows: Data substitution  will be performed for each month of the 3-month period that has less  than 75 percent but at least 50 percent data capture; if any month has  less than 50% data capture then the 3-month mean can not utilize this  substitution test. Also, incomplete 3-month Pb-PM10 means can  not utilize this test. A 3-month Pb-TSP mean with less than 75% data  capture shall still be considered valid (and complete) if, by  substituting the highest reported daily value, month-specific, over the  3-year design value period in question, for all missing scheduled data  in the deficient months (i.e., bringing the data capture rate up to  100%), the computation yields a recalculated 3-month parameter mean  concentration equal or less than the level of the standard (0.15  [micro]g/m\3\), then the 3-month mean is deemed to have passed the  diagnostic test and the level of the standard is deemed not to have been  exceeded in that 3-month period (for that parameter). As noted in  section 4(c)(ii), in such a case, the 3-month parameter mean of the data  actually reported, not the recalculated (``test'') result   including the high values, shall be used to determine the design value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Months that do not meet the completeness criteria stated in  4(c)(i) or 4(c)(ii), and design values that do not meet the completeness  criteria stated in 4(a) or 4(b), may also be considered valid (and  complete) with the approval of, or at the initiative of, the  Administrator, who may consider factors such as monitoring site  closures/moves, monitoring diligence, the consistency and levels of the  valid concentration measurements that are available, and nearby  concentrations in determining whether to use such data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The site-level design value for a 38-month period (three  calendar years plus two previous months) is identified from the  available (between one and 36) valid 3-month site means. In a situation  where there are valid 3-month means for both parameters (Pb-TSP and Pb- PM10), the mean originating from the reported Pb-TSP data  will be the one deemed the site-level monthly mean and used in design  value identifications unless the Pb-PM10 mean shows a  violation of the NAAQS and exceeds the Pb-TSP mean; see section 2(a) for  details. A monitoring site will have only one site-level 3-month mean  per 3-month period; however, the set of site-level 3-month means  considered for design value identification (i.e., one to 36 site-level  3-month means) can be a combination of Pb-TSP and Pb-PM10  data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The procedures for calculating monthly means and 3-month means,  and identifying Pb design values are given in section 6 of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rounding Conventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Monthly means and monthly data capture rates are not rounded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Three-month means shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth  [micro]g/m\3\ (0.xx). Decimals 0.xx5 and greater are rounded up, and any  decimal lower than 0.xx5 is rounded down. E.g., a 3-month mean of  0.104925 rounds to 0.10 and a 3-month mean of .10500 rounds to 0.11.  Three-month data capture rates, expressed as a percent, are round to  zero decimal places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because a Pb design value is simply a (highest) 3-month mean and  because the NAAQS level is stated to two decimal places, no additional  rounding beyond what is specified for 3-month means is required before a  design value is compared to the NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0">6.

This provision is to protect the integrity of the monthly  and 3-month mean concentration values in situations in which, by  intention or otherwise, extra sampling days are concentrated in a period  during which ambient concentrations are particularly high or low. The  alternate approach is to average all extra and make-up samples (in the  given month) taken after each scheduled sampling day (``Day X'') and  before the next scheduled sampling day (e.g., ``Day X+6'', in the case  of one-in-six sampling) with the sample taken on Day X (assuming valid  data was obtained on the scheduled sampling day), and then averaging  these averages to calculate the monthly mean. This approach has the  effect of giving approximately equal weight to periods during a month  that have equal number of days, regardless of how many samples were  actually obtained during the periods, thus mitigating the potential for  the monthly mean to be distorted. The first day of scheduled sampling  typically will not fall on the first day of the calendar month, and  there may be make-up and/or extra samples (in that same calendar month)  preceding the first scheduled day of the month. These samples will not  be shifted into the previous month's mean concentration, but rather will  stay associated with their actual calendar month as follows. Any extra  and make-up samples taken in a month before the first scheduled sampling  day of the month will be associated with and averaged with the last  scheduled sampling day of that same month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Three-month parameter means are determined by averaging three  consecutive monthly means of the same parameter using Equation 2 of this  appendix.

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is  measured in the ambient air by a Federal reference method (FRM) based on  appendix A or A-1 to this part or by a Federal equivalent method (FEM)  designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter. Data handling and  computation procedures to be used in making comparisons between reported  SO2 concentrations and the levels of the SO2 NAAQS  are specified in the following sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Decisions to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to the data  affected by exceptional events, including natural events, are made  according to the requirements and process deadlines specified in  Sec.

This paragraph  does not prohibit a monitoring agency from making a local designation of  one physical monitor as the primary monitor for a Pollutant Occurrence  Code and substituting the 1-hour data from a second physical monitor  whenever a valid concentration value is not obtained from the primary  monitor; if a monitoring agency substitutes data in this manner, each  substituted value must be accompanied by an AQS qualifier code  indicating that substitution with a value from a second physical monitor  has taken place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hourly SO2 measurement data shall be reported to AQS  in units of parts per billion (ppb), to at most one place after the  decimal, with additional digits to the right being truncated with no  further rounding.</p><p class="depth0">3.

(For example: (x[1], x[2], x[3], * * *, x[n]).  In this case, x[1] is the largest number and x[n] is the smallest  value.) The 99th percentile is determined from this sorted series of  daily values which is ordered from the highest to the lowest number.  Using the left column of Table 1, determine the appropriate range (i.e.,  row) for the annual number of days with valid data for year y  (cny). The corresponding ``n'' value in the right column  identifies the rank of the annual 99th percentile value in the  descending sorted list of daily site values for year y.
