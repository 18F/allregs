                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Posting dates. The date on which the TSP processes or posts a contribution allocation or interfund transfer request (transaction request) is subject to a number of factors, including some that are outside of the control of the TSP, such as power outages, the failure of telephone service, unusually heavy transaction volume, and acts of God. These factors also could affect the availability of the TSP Web site and the ThriftLine. Therefore, the TSP cannot guarantee that a transaction request will be processed on a particular day. However, the TSP will process transaction requests under ordinary circumstances according to the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transaction request entered into the TSP record keeping system by a participant who uses the TSP Web site or the ThriftLine, or by a TSP Service Office participant service representative at the participant's request, before

12 noon eastern time of any business day, will ordinarily be posted that business day. A transaction request entered into the system at or after 12 noon eastern time of any business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A transaction request made on the TSP Web site or the ThriftLine on a non-business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A transaction request made on a paper TSP form will ordinarily be posted under the rules in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, based on when the TSP record keeper enters the form into the TSP system. The TSP record keeper ordinarily enters such forms into the system within 24 hours of their receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In most cases, the share price(s) applied to an interfund transfer request is the value of the shares on the date the relevant transaction is posted. In some circumstances, such as error correction, the share price(s) for an earlier date will be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limit. There is no limit on the number of contribution allocation requests. A participant may make two unrestricted interfund transfers (account rebalancings) per account (e.g., civilian or uniformed services), per calendar month. An interfund transfer will count toward the monthly total on the date posted by the TSP and not on the date requested by a participant. After a participant has made two interfund transfers in a calendar month, the participant may make additional interfund transfers only into the G Fund until the first day of the next calendar month.
