                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EPA may, at its discretion, grant a refiner of crude oil that  processes crude oil through refinery processing units, for one or more  of its refineries, temporary relief from some or all of the provisions  of this subpart. Such relief shall be no less stringent than the small  refiner compliance options specified in Sec. 80.552 for motor vehicle  diesel fuel and Sec. 80.554 for NRLM diesel fuel. EPA may grant such  relief provided that the refiner demonstrates that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unusual circumstances exist that impose extreme hardship and  significantly affect the refiner's ability to comply by the applicable  date; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It has made best efforts to comply with the requirements of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For motor vehicle diesel fuel, applications must be submitted  to EPA by June 1, 2002 to the following address: U.S. EPA--Attn: Diesel  Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1200  Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return  receipt) or Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs  Division, 1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005 (express  mail/return receipt). EPA reserves the right to deny applications for  appropriate reasons, including unacceptable environmental impact.  Approval to distribute motor vehicle diesel fuel not subject to the 15  ppm sulfur standard may be granted for such time period as EPA  determines is appropriate, but shall not extend beyond May 31, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For NRLM diesel fuel, applications must be submitted to EPA by  June 1, 2005 to the following address: U.S. EPA--Attn: Diesel Hardship,  Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania  Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return receipt) or  Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division,  1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005 (express mail/return  receipt). EPA reserves the right to deny applications   for appropriate reasons, including unacceptable environmental impact.  Approval to distribute NRLM diesel fuel not subject to the 500 ppm  sulfur standard may be granted for such time period as EPA determines is  appropriate, but shall not extend beyond May 31, 2010 for NR diesel fuel  and May 31, 2012 for NRLM diesel fuel. Approval to distribute NRLM  diesel fuel not subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard may be granted for  such time period as EPA determines is appropriate, but shall not extend  beyond May 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications must include a plan demonstrating how the refiner  will comply with the requirements of this subpart as expeditiously as  possible. The plan shall include a showing that contracts are or will be  in place for engineering and construction of desulfurization equipment a  plan for applying for and obtaining any permits necessary for  construction or operation, projected timeline for beginning and  completing construction, and for beginning actual operation of such  equipment, and a description of plans to obtain necessary capital, and a  detailed estimate of when the requirements of this subpart will be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicants must provide, at a minimum, the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detailed description of efforts to obtain capital for refinery  investments and efforts made to obtain credits for compliance under  Sec. 80.531 for motor vehicle diesel fuel or Sec. Sec. 80.535 through  80.536 for NRLM diesel fuel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bond rating of entity that owns the refinery (in the case of  joint ventures, include the bond rating of the joint venture entity and  the bond ratings of all partners; in the case of corporations, include  the bond ratings of any parent or subsidiary corporations); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Estimated capital investment needed to comply with the  requirements of this subpart by the applicable date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> must also include a compliance plan.  Such compliance plan shall demonstrate how the refiner will engage in a  quality assurance testing program, where appropriate, to ensure that the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its motor vehicle diesel fuel subject solely to the sulfur  standards under Sec. 80.520(c) has not caused motor vehicle diesel fuel  subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard Sec. 80.520(a)(1) to fail to  comply with that standard; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its NRLM diesel fuel subject solely to the 500 ppm sulfur  standard under Sec. 80.510(a) has not caused NRLM diesel fuel subject to  the 15 ppm sulfur standard under Sec. 80.510(b) or (c) to fail to comply  with that standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The quality assurance program must at least include periodic  sampling and testing at the party's own facilities and at downstream  facilities in the refiner's or importer's diesel fuel distribution  system, to determine compliance with the applicable sulfur standards for  both categories of motor vehicle diesel fuel; examination at the party's  own facilities and at applicable downstream facilities, of product  transfer documents to confirm appropriate transfers and deliveries of  both products; and inspection of retailer and wholesale purchaser- consumer pump stands for the presence of the labels and warning signs  required under this section. Any violations that are discovered shall be  reported to EPA within 48 hours of discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applications under this section must be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief  executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the  information contained in the application is true to the best of his/her  knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, phone number, facsimile number and e-mail  address of a corporate contact person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Applicants must also provide any other relevant information  requested by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Refiners who are granted a hardship relief standard for any  refinery and importers of fuel subject to temporary foreign refiner  relief standards, must comply with the requirements of Sec. 80.561(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> EPA may impose any reasonable conditions on waivers under this  section, including limitations on the refinery's volume of motor vehicle  diesel   fuel and NRLM diesel fuel subject to temporary refiner relief standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The provisions of this section are available only to refineries  that produce diesel fuel from crude.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The individual refinery sulfur standard and the compliance plan  will be approved or disapproved by the Administrator, and approval will  be effective when the refiner receives an approval letter from EPA.  Unless approved, the refiner or, where applicable, the importer must  comply with the motor vehicle diesel fuel standard under  Sec. 80.520(a)(1) by the appropriate compliance date specified in  Sec. 80.500 or the NRLM diesel fuel standards and compliance dates under  Sec. 80.510(a), (b), and (c) as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate  information on its application for hardship relief, EPA's approval of  the refiners application will be void ab initio.
