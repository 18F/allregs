Each chain, wire rope, or integral locking device must be  attached to the container in a manner that prevents it from being  unintentionally unfastened while the vehicle is in transit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Securement of empty intermodal containers transported on  vehicles other than container chassis vehicle(s). Empty intermodal  containers transported on vehicles other than container chassis vehicles  do not have to have all lower corners of the intermodal container  resting upon the vehicle, or have all lower corners supported by a  structure capable of bearing the weight of the empty container,  provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The empty intermodal container is balanced and positioned on the  vehicle in a manner such that the container is stable before the  addition of tiedowns or other securement equipment; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of overhang for the empty container on the trailer  does not exceed five feet on either the front or rear of the trailer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The empty intermodal container must not interfere with the  vehicle's maneuverability; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The empty intermodal container is secured to prevent lateral,  longitudinal, or vertical shifting.
