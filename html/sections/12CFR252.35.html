                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Liquidity stress testing requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. A bank  holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more  must conduct stress tests to assess the potential impact of the  liquidity stress scenarios set forth in paragraph (a)(3) on its cash  flows, liquidity position, profitability, and solvency, taking into  account its current liquidity condition, risks, exposures, strategies,  and activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The bank holding company must take into consideration its  balance sheet exposures, off-balance sheet exposures, size, risk  profile, complexity, business lines, organizational structure, and other  characteristics of the bank holding company that affect its liquidity  risk profile in conducting its stress test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In conducting a liquidity stress test using the scenarios  described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (iii) of this section, the bank  holding company must address the potential direct adverse impact of  associated market disruptions on the bank holding company and  incorporate the potential actions of other market participants  experiencing liquidity stresses under the market disruptions that would  adversely affect the bank holding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Frequency. The liquidity stress tests required under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section must be performed at least monthly. The Board may  require the bank holding company to perform stress testing more  frequently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stress scenarios. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each liquidity stress test conducted under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section must include, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A scenario reflecting adverse market conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A scenario reflecting an idiosyncratic stress event for the bank  holding company; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A scenario reflecting combined market and idiosyncratic  stresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The bank holding company must incorporate additional liquidity  stress scenarios into its liquidity stress test, as appropriate, based  on its financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of  operations, or activities. The Board may require the bank holding  company to vary the underlying assumptions and stress scenarios.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Planning horizon. Each stress test conducted under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section must include an overnight planning horizon, a 30- day planning horizon, a 90-day planning horizon, a one-year planning  horizon, and any other planning horizons that are relevant to the bank  holding company's liquidity risk profile. For purposes of this section,  a ``planning horizon'' is the period over which the relevant stressed  projections extend. The bank holding company must use the results of the  stress test over the 30-day planning horizon to calculate the size of  the liquidity buffer under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirements for assets used as cash-flow sources in a stress  test. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the extent an asset is used as a cash flow source to offset  projected funding needs during the planning horizon in a liquidity  stress test, the fair market value of the asset must be discounted to  reflect any credit risk and market volatility of the asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assets used as cash-flow sources during a planning horizon must  be diversified by collateral, counterparty, borrowing capacity, and  other factors associated with the liquidity risk of the assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A line of credit does not qualify as a cash flow source for  purposes of a stress test with a planning horizon of 30 days or less. A  line of credit may qualify as a cash flow source for purposes of a  stress test with a planning horizon that exceeds 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tailoring. Stress testing must be tailored to, and provide  sufficient detail to reflect, a bank holding company's capital  structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Governance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Policies and procedures. A bank holding company  with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must establish and  maintain policies and procedures governing its liquidity stress testing  practices, methodologies, and assumptions that provide for the  incorporation of the results of liquidity stress tests in future stress  testing and for the enhancement of stress testing practices over time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Controls and oversight. A bank holding company with total  consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must establish and maintain a  system of controls and oversight that is designed to ensure that its  liquidity stress testing processes are effective in meeting the  requirements of this section. The controls and oversight must ensure  that each liquidity stress test appropriately incorporates conservative  assumptions with respect to the stress scenario in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section and other elements of the stress test process, taking into  consideration the bank holding company's capital structure, risk  profile, complexity, activities, size, business lines, legal entity or  jurisdiction, and other relevant factors. The assumptions must be  approved by the chief risk officer and be subject to the independent  review under Sec. 252.34(d) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Management information systems. The bank holding company must  maintain management information systems and data processes sufficient to  enable it to effectively and reliably collect, sort, and aggregate data  and other information related to liquidity stress testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Liquidity buffer requirement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A bank holding company with  total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must maintain a  liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed  cash-flow need over the 30-day planning horizon of a liquidity stress  test conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section under  each scenario set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net stressed cash-flow need. The net stressed cash-flow need for  a bank holding company is the difference between the amount of its cash- flow need and the amount of its cash flow sources over the 30-day  planning horizon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em>  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Highly liquid asset. A highly liquid asset includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cash;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Securities issued or guaranteed by the United States, a U.S.  government agency, or a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other asset that the bank holding company demonstrates to  the satisfaction of the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has low credit risk and low market risk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is traded in an active secondary two-way market that has  committed market makers and independent bona fide offers to buy and sell  so that a price reasonably related to the last sales price or current  bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined within  one day and settled at that price within a reasonable time period  conforming with trade custom; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is a type of asset that investors historically have purchased in  periods of financial market distress during which market liquidity has  been impaired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unencumbered. An asset is unencumbered if it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is free of legal, regulatory, contractual, or other restrictions  on the ability of such company promptly to liquidate, sell or transfer  the asset; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not pledged or used to secure or provide credit enhancement to  any transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pledged to a central bank or a U.S. government-sponsored  enterprise, to the extent potential credit secured by the asset is not  currently extended by such central bank or U.S. government-sponsored  enterprise or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Calculating the amount of a highly liquid asset. In  calculating the amount of a highly liquid asset included in the  liquidity buffer, the bank holding company must discount the fair market  value of the asset to reflect any credit risk and market price  volatility of the asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Diversification. The liquidity buffer must not contain  significant concentrations of highly liquid assets by issuer, business  sector, region, or other factor related to the bank holding company's  risk, except with respect to cash and securities issued or guaranteed by  the United States, a U.S. government agency, or a U.S. government- sponsored enterprise.</p>
