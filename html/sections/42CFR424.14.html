                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for certification and recertification: General  considerations. Certification begins with the order for   inpatient admission. The content requirements differ from those for  other hospitals because the care furnished in inpatient psychiatric  facilities is often purely custodial and thus not covered under  Medicare. The purpose of the statements, therefore, is to help ensure  that Medicare pays only for services of the type appropriate for  Medicare coverage. Accordingly, Medicare Part A pays for inpatient  services in an inpatient psychiatric facility only if a physician  certifies and recertifies the need for services consistent with the  requirements of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of certification. The physician must certify--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That inpatient psychiatric services were required for treatment  that could reasonably be expected to improve the patient's condition, or  for diagnostic study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the inpatient psychiatric services were provided in  accordance with Sec. 412.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of recertification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inpatient services furnished  since the previous certification or recertification were, and continue  to be, required--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For treatment that could reasonably be expected to improve the  patient's condition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For diagnostic study; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hospital records show that the services furnished were--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Intensive treatment services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Admission and related services necessary for diagnostic study;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Equivalent services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The patient continues to need, on a daily basis, active  treatment furnished directly by or requiring the supervision of  inpatient psychiatric facility personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of certification and recertification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification  is required at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is  reasonable and practicable, and must be completed and documented in the  medical record prior to discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first recertification is required as of the 12th day of  hospitalization. Subsequent recertifications are required at intervals  established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so  chooses), but no less frequently than every 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other requirements. Inpatient psychiatric facilities must also  meet the requirements set forth in Sec. 424.13(c), (d), (g), and (h).
