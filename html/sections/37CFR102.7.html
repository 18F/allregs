                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grants of requests. If the FOIA Officer makes a determination to  grant a request in whole or in part, the FOIA Officer will notify the  requester in writing. The FOIA Officer will inform the requester in the  notice of any fee charged under Sec.  102.11 and disclose records to the  requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed  in part shall be marked or annotated to show each applicable FOIA  exemption and the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would  harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of  the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if  feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adverse determinations of requests. If the FOIA Officer makes an  adverse determination regarding a request, the FOIA Officer will notify  the requester of that determination in writing. An adverse determination  is a denial of a request in any respect, namely: A determination to  withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that  a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination  that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought  by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a  record subject to FOIA (except that a determination under Sec.   102.11(j) that records are to be made available under a fee statute  other than FOIA is not an adverse determination); a determination  against the requester on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of  a request for a fee waiver; or a denial of a request for expedited  treatment. Each denial letter shall be signed by the FOIA Officer and  shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and title or position of the denying official;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including  applicable FOIA exemption(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in  number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This  estimate need not be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated  through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an  estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA  exemption; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the denial may be appealed, and a list of the  requirements for filing an appeal under Sec.  102.10(b).</p>
