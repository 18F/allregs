The operator shall, within 10 calendar days, advise the port director if the employment of any employee is terminated. A person shall not be deemed to be employed by an operator if he is an officer or employee of an independent contractor engaged by the operator to move, receive, store, deliver, or otherwise handle imported merchandise.</p>
