                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limit in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, the work practice standards in Table 3 to this subpart, and the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in Table 8 to this subpart and paragraphs (a)(1) through (19) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the date on which the initial compliance demonstration is completed or is required to be completed under Sec. Sec. 63.7 and 63.7510, whichever date comes first, operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits shall constitute a deviation of established operating limits listed in Table 4 of this subpart except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits or to establish new operating limits. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during performance tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As specified in Sec. 63.7550(c), you must keep records of the type and amount of all fuels burned in each boiler or process heater during the reporting period to demonstrate that all fuel types and mixtures of fuels burned would result in either of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lower emissions of HCl, mercury, and TSM than the applicable emission limit for each pollutant, if you demonstrate compliance through fuel analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lower fuel input of chlorine, mercury, and TSM than the maximum values calculated during the last performance test, if you demonstrate compliance through performance testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable HCl emission limit through fuel analysis for a solid or liquid fuel and you plan to burn a new type of solid or liquid fuel, you must recalculate the HCl emission rate using Equation 12 of Sec. 63.7530 according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in Sec. 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in Sec. 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the HCl emission rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must determine the chlorine concentration for any new fuel type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific fuel analysis plan developed according to Sec. 63.7521(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the highest content of chlorine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Recalculate the HCl emission rate from your boiler or process heater under these new conditions using Equation 12 of Sec. 63.7530.

If the results of recalculating the maximum chlorine input using Equation 7 of Sec. 63.7530 are greater than the maximum chlorine input level established during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7520 to demonstrate that the HCl emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new operating limits based on this performance test according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7530(b). In recalculating the maximum chlorine input and establishing the new operating limits, you are not required to conduct fuel analyses for and include the fuels described in Sec. 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury emission limit through fuel analysis, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel, you must recalculate the mercury emission rate using Equation 13 of Sec. 63.7530 according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in Sec. 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii).

The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the applicable emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury emission limit through performance testing, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum mercury input using Equation 8 of Sec. 63.7530. If the results of recalculating the maximum mercury input using Equation 8 of Sec. 63.7530 are higher than the maximum mercury input level established during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7520 to demonstrate that the mercury emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new operating limits based on this performance test according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7530(b).

You must also record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the conditions exist for an alert. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alert time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alert shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alert time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To demonstrate compliance with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission limit listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Continuously monitor CO according to Sec.
