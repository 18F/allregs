The total amount of the annual assessment of banks,  associations, and designated other System entities shall be based on the  FCA budget for each fiscal year   plus such amount as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve,  excluding amounts to be assessed against other System entities and  reimbursements received from non-System entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The assessment shall be apportioned among the banks,  associations, and designated other System entities as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Thirty (30) percent of the assessment under this section shall  be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System  entity on the basis of each institution's pro rata share of the total  average risk-adjusted asset base.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section. The actual  assessment rate under this paragraph shall be determined annually based  on relative average risk-adjusted asset bases, the FIRS ratings of  individual institutions, and the FCA budget as adjusted pursuant to  paragraph (a) of this section, but the relationship between the rates  applied to each tier shall remain constant as set forth in the following  table.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Average risk-adjusted asset size range (in</p><p class="depth3">millions) --------------------------------------------------    Assessment rate</p><p class="depth3">Over                       To ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $0..................................          $25  X1 25..................................           50  .85X1 50..................................          100  .75X1 100.................................          500  .60X1 500.................................        1,000  .50X1 1,000...............................        7,000  .35X1 7,000...............................       10,000  .20X1 10,000..............................  ...........  .10X1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Example: XYZ association has a FIRS rating of 2 and average risk- adjusted assets of $500.4 million.
