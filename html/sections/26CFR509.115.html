Pursuant to Article XII of the convention, a professor  or teacher, a nonresident alien who is a resident of Switzerland, who  temporarily visits the United States for the purpose of teaching for a  period not exceeding two years at any university, college, school, or  other educational institution situated within the United States shall,  for a period not exceeding two years from the date of his initial  arrival in the United States, be exempt from United States tax with  respect to his remuneration earned in taxable years beginning on or  after January 1, 1951, for such teaching during such period not in  excess of two years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> More than two years. The exemption granted by Article XII is  applicable to remuneration earned during such part of the individual's  visit as does not exceed two years from the date of arrival even though  the total period of his presence in the United States may extend beyond  two years, provided that during such entire period he may be considered  to be temporarily visiting the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Residence. Such exemption shall not apply to the remuneration of  an alien who is a resident of the United States or who is not a resident  of Switzerland.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nonresidence presumed. An individual who otherwise qualifies for  the exemption from United States tax granted by Article XII shall, for a  period of not more than two years immediately succeeding the date of his  arrival within the United States for the purpose of such teaching, be  deemed to have the tax status of a nonresident alien in the absence of  proof of his intention to remain indefinitely in the United States.
