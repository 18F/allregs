                                Sec. 13.233  Appeal from initial decision.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. A party shall file the notice of appeal not  later than 10 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the  record or service of the written initial decision on the parties and  shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal on each party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issues on appeal. In any appeal from a decision of an  administrative law judge, the FAA decisionmaker considers only the  following issues:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with  applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial  errors that support the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a  party shall perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the  oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial  decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the FAA  decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may  agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of  the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of  time to perfect the appeal, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a  letter confirming the extension of time on each party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an  extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an  extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the  FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party.  The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the  extension is shown in the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appeal briefs. A party shall file the appeal brief with the FAA  decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the appeal brief on each party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party shall set forth, in detail, the party's specific  objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief. A  party also shall set forth, in detail, the basis for the appeal, the  reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal.  If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal,  the party shall specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained  in the transcript in the appeal brief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FAA decisionmaker may dismiss an appeal, on the FAA  decisionmaker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where  a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by  timely filing an appeal brief with the FAA decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party  may file a reply brief with the FAA decisionmaker not later than 35 days  after the appeal brief has been served on that party. The party filing  the reply brief shall serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. If  the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the  party shall specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in  the transcript in the reply brief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may  agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of  the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of  time to file the reply brief, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a  letter confirming the extension of time on each party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an  extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an  extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the  FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party.  The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the  extension is shown in the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other briefs. The FAA decisionmaker may allow any person to  submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A  party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party  may petition the FAA decisionmaker, in writing, for leave to file an  additional brief and shall serve a copy of the petition on each party.  The party may not file the additional brief with the petition. The FAA  decisionmaker may grant leave to file an additional brief if the party  demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal.  The FAA decisionmaker will allow a reasonable time for the party to file  the additional brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Number of copies. A party shall file the original appeal brief  or the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the FAA  decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Oral argument. The FAA decisionmaker has sole discretion to  permit oral argument on the appeal. On the FAA decisionmaker's own  initiative or upon written motion by any party, the FAA decisionmaker  may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the  development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an  opportunity for oral argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to  any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply  brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The FAA  decisionmaker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal  brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based  on evidence contained on the record and the party does not specifically  refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> FAA decisionmaker's decision on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker  will review the record, the briefs on appeal, and the oral argument, if  any, when considering the issues on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker may  affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary  findings, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA  decisionmaker determines may be necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FAA decisionmaker may raise any issue, on the FAA  decisionmaker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition  of the proceedings. The FAA decisionmaker will give the parties a  reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues   before making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the FAA  decisionmaker requires the consideration of additional testimony or  evidence, the FAA decisionmaker will remand the case to the  administrative law judge for further proceedings and an initial decision  related to that issue. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker is  solely an issue of law or the issue was addressed at the hearing but was  not raised by a party in the briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to  the administrative law judge for further proceedings is not required but  may be provided in the discretion of the FAA decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FAA decisionmaker will issue the final decision and order of  the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the  decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed  pursuant to Sec. 13.235, a final decision and order of the  Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if  the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a  civil penalty is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is  precedent in any other civil penalty action. Any issue, finding or  conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law  judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker is not  precedent in any other civil penalty action.
