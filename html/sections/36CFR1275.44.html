                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 30 days following publication of the notice prescribed in   Sec. 1275.42(b), any person claiming a legal or constitutional right or  privilege which would prevent or limit public access to any of the  materials shall notify the Archivist in writing of the claimed right or  privilege and the specific materials to which it relates. Unless the  claim states that particular materials are private or personal (see  paragraph (d) of this section), the Archivist will notify the claimant  by certified mail, return receipt requested, of his decision regarding  public access to the pertinent materials. If that decision is adverse to  the claimant, the Archivist will refrain from providing public access to  the pertinent materials for at least 30 calendar days from receipt by  the claimant of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, officers of any Federal, State, or local court and  other persons who believe that public access to any of the materials may  jeopardize an individual's right to a fair and impartial trial should  petition the Archivist setting forth the relevant circumstances that  warrant withholding specified materials. The Archivist will notify the  petitioner by certified mail, return receipt requested, of his decision  regarding public access to the pertinent materials. If that decision is  adverse to the petitioner, the Archivist will refrain from providing  public access to the pertinent materials for at least 30 calendar days  from receipt by the petitioner of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In reaching decisions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section, the Archivist may consult with other appropriate Federal  agencies. If these consultations require the transfer of copies of the  materials to Federal officials in agencies other than the National  Archives and Records Administration, the Archivist will transfer these  copies in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Sec. Sec.  1275.26 and 1275.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 30 days following publication of notice prescribed in  Sec. 1275.42(b), any person claiming that materials proposed for public  access are in fact private or personal, as defined in Sec. 1275.16(b),  and that he or she is the proprietary or commemorative owner of those  materials shall notify the Archivist in writing. The claim shall  describe the specific materials to which it refers, and the claimant's  basis for concluding that these materials are private or personal. Upon  receipt of such a claim, the Archivist will transmit it to the  Presidential Materials Review Board for its consideration and  determination in accordance with Sec. 1275.46(i). The Archivist will  refrain from providing public access to the pertinent materials or from  returning them to the claimant for at least 30 calendar days from  receipt by the claimant or any intervening parties of the Board's  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> In place of the right to make all other objections with  respect to the tape segments that NARA has designated as abuses of  governmental power materials, the Nixon estate may object to their  release only on the ground that such designation by NARA is clearly  inconsistent with the term ``abuses of governmental power'' as used in  Sec. 104(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Presidential Recordings and Materials  Preservation Act (PRMPA) and defined in Sec. 1275.16(c), as qualified  by Sec. 1275.50(b). Any such objection may not be based on isolated  instances of alleged failure by NARA to apply the appropriate review  standard, but only on a pattern of misapplication of the requirements of  the PRMPA and its implementing regulations. Further, any such objection  must be accompanied by specific examples of alleged review errors and  contain sufficient information to enable the review panel of three  Presidential Library archivists appointed by the Archivist, as described  in the Settlement Agreement, Appendix A to this Part, to locate those  examples readily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an objection is made by the Nixon estate to the abuses of  governmental power tape segments, the matter shall be immediately  referred to a panel of three Presidential Library archivists appointed  by the Archivist as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, Appendix A to  this Part. The decision of the panel shall be either that the Nixon  estate's objection is sustained or that it is rejected. The decision  shall include a brief statement of the panel's reasons, but it need not  include an item-by-item determination. In deciding whether the  designation by NARA   of the material proposed to be released is clearly inconsistent with the  definition of ``abuses of governmental power'', the panel shall consider  whether the release would seriously injure legitimate interests of  identifiable individuals, whether the errors suggest a pattern of  misinterpretation, and any other factor that bears on the issue of  whether NARA's designation of material as relating to ``abuses of  governmental power'' was reasonable, considered as a whole. The panel's  decision shall be final and binding on all parties to the Kutler  litigation, and no party may exercise any right to appeal to any person,  board, or court that might otherwise be available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Nixon estate may, at any time, elect to use the procedures  outlined in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section for the tape  recordings other than the abuses of governmental power segments, except  that the standard under which objections shall be made by the Nixon  estate, and under which the review panel shall decide their merits, is  whether the release taken as a whole is plainly inconsistent with the  requirements of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation  Act of 1974 and these regulations. If the Nixon estate elects to use the  procedures in paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement (Appendix A to  this Part) in place of the provisions in paragraphs 4 (b) and (d) and  5(c) of the Settlement Agreement for a tape segment, the estate cannot  subsequently revert back to the formal objection process set forth in  this section for that tape segment.
