Under section 383, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a loss corporation, the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) for a post-change year shall apply to limit the amount of taxable income and regular tax liability, respectively, that can be offset by pre-change capital losses and pre-change credits of the new loss corporation. The section 383 credit limitation for a post-change year bears a direct relationship to the amount, if any, of the section 382 limitation that remains after taking into account the reduction in the loss corporation's taxable income during a post-change year as a result of its pre-change losses (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). In general, the section 383 credit limitation is an amount equal to the tax liability of the new loss corporation for the post-change year which is attributable to so much of the corporation's taxable income that would be reduced by allowing as a deduction its section 382 limitation remaining after accounting for the use of pre-change losses. As pre-change losses and pre-change credits of a corporation are used, they absorb the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation, respectively, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section. See also section 382 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--(1) Coordination with definitions and nomenclature used in section 382.

amount equal to the section 382 limitation remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. L, a new loss corporation, is a calendar year taxpayer. L has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. For 1988, L has taxable income (prior to the use of any pre-change losses) of $100,000. In addition, L has a section 382 limitation of $25,000, a pre-change net operating loss carryover of $12,000, a pre-change minimum tax credit of $50,000, and no pre-change capital losses. L's section 383 credit limitation is the excess of its regular tax liability computed after allowing a $12,000 net operating loss deduction (taxable income of $88,000; regular tax liability of $18,170), over its regular tax liability computed after allowing an additional deduction in the amount of L's section 382 limitation remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, or $13,000 (taxable income of $75,000; regular tax liability of $13,750). L's section 383 credit limitation is therefore $4,420 ($18,170 minus $13,750).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on use of pre-change losses and pre-change credits--(1) In general. The amount of taxable income of a new loss corporation for any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change losses shall not exceed the amount of the section 382 limitation for the post-change year. The amount of the regular tax liability of a new loss corporation for any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change credits shall not exceed the amount of the section 383 credit limitation for the post-change year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The amount of the regular tax liability of a new loss corporation for any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change credits shall not exceed the amount of the section 383 credit limitation for the post-change year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ordering rules for utilization of pre-change losses and pre-change credits and for absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation. Pre-change losses described in any subdivision of this paragraph (d)(2) can offset taxable income in a post-change year only to the extent that the section 382 limitation for that year has not been absorbed by pre-change losses described in any lower-numbered subdivisions. Pre-change credits described in any subdivision of this paragraph (d)(2) can offset regular tax liability in a post-change year only to the extent that the section 383 credit limitation for that year has not been absorbed by pre-change credits described in any lower numbered subdivisions. The section 382 limitation is absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-change loss that is used to offset taxable income. The section 383 credit limitation is absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-change credit that is used to offset regular tax liability. For each post-change year, the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation of a new loss corporation are absorbed by such corporation's pre-change losses and pre-change credits in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pre-change capital losses described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section that are recognized and are subject to the section 382 limitation in such post-change year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-change capital losses described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pre-change losses that are described in Sec. 1.382-2(a)(2) (other than losses that are pre-change capital losses) that are recognized and are subject to the section 382 limitation in such post-change year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pre-change losses not described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (excess foreign taxes),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (business credits), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section (minimum tax credit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with other limitations--(i) In general. Paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be applied after the application of all other limitations contained in subtitle A which are applicable to the use of a pre-change loss or pre-change credit in a post-change year. Thus, only otherwise currently allowable pre-change losses and pre-change credits will result in the absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be applied after the application of all other limitations contained in subtitle A which are applicable to the use of a pre-change loss or pre-change credit in a post-change year. Thus, only otherwise currently allowable pre-change losses and pre-change credits will result in the absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. L is a calendar year taxpayer and has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. For 1988, L has taxable income of $300,000, a regular tax liability of $100,250 and a tentative minimum tax of $90,000. L has no pre-change losses, but has a business credit carryforward from 1985 of $25,000, no portion of which is due to the regular percentage of

the investment tax credit under section 46. L has a section 382 limitation for 1988 of $50,000. L's section 383 credit limitation is $19,500, i.e., an amount equal to the excess of L's regular tax liability ($100,250) over its regular tax liability calculated by allowing an additional deduction of $50,000. Pursuant to the limitation contained in section 38(c), however, L is entitled to use only $10,250 of its business credit carryforward in 1988. The unabsorbed portion of L's section 382 limitation (computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section) is carried forward under section 382(b)(2). The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $14,750, is carried forward to the extent provided in section 39.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that L's tentative minimum tax is $70,000. L's use of its investment tax credit carryforward is no longer limited by section 38(c); however, pursuant to section 383 and this section, L is entitled to use only $19,500 of its business credit carryforward in 1988. The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $5,500, is carried forward to the extent provided in section 39. There is no unused section 382 limitation to be carried forward.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Carryforward of unused section 382 limitation--(1) Computation of carryforward amount. The section 382 limitation that can be carried forward under section 382(b)(2) is the excess, if any, of (i) the section 382 limitation for the post-change year remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, over (ii) the section 383 credit reduction amount for that post-change year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Computation of carryforward amount. The section 382 limitation that can be carried forward under section 382(b)(2) is the excess, if any, of (i) the section 382 limitation for the post-change year remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, over (ii) the section 383 credit reduction amount for that post-change year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 383 credit reduction amount. The section 383 credit reduction amount for a post-change year is equal to the amount of taxable income attributable to the portion of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the year that is offset by pre-change credits. Each dollar of regular tax liability that is offset by a dollar of pre-change credit is divided by the effective marginal rate at which that dollar of tax was imposed to determine the amount of taxable income that resulted in that particular dollar of regular tax liability. The sum of these ``grossed-up'' amounts for the taxable year is the section 383 credit reduction amount. In determining the effective marginal rate at which a dollar of tax was imposed, special rules regarding rates of tax (e.g., sections 11(b)(2) and (15) or taxable income brackets (e.g., section 1561), or both, shall be taken into account. See Example (3) in paragraph (f) of this section illustrating the effect of section 1561(a). Paragraph (e)(3) of this section illustrates the gross-up computation of the section 383 credit reduction amount based on the tax table and the rates of tax prescribed by section 11(b) as in effect for taxable years beginning on January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation of section 383 credit reduction amount; illustration using tax rates and brackets in effect for calendar year 1988. (i) Assuming no special rules regarding rates of tax or taxable income brackets apply, the section 383 credit reduction amount for a new loss corporation is the sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assuming no special rules regarding rates of tax or taxable income brackets apply, the section 383 credit reduction amount for a new loss corporation is the sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount determined under this subdivision (ii) is the amount (if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability as exceeds $113,900, divided by 0.34.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(iii) is the amount (if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability as exceeds $22,250 (but does not exceed $113,900), divided by 0.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(iv) is the amount (if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability as exceeds $13,750 (but does not exceed $22,250), divided by 0.34.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(v) is the amount (if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability as exceeds $7,500 (but does not exceed $13,750), divided by 0.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The amount determined under this subdivision (e)(3)(vi) is the amount (if any) by which pre-change credits offset so much of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability as does not exceed $7,500, divided by 0.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for determining the section 383 credit reduction amount--(i) Ordering rules. For purposes of this paragraph (e), credits, including pre-change credits, are considered to offset regular tax liability in the order that such

credits are applied under the ordering rules of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 and section 904. For example, for purposes of this paragraph (e), excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c) (whether or not a pre-change credit) are considered (under section 38(c)) to offset regular tax liability before the general business credit carryovers to the taxable year are considered (under section 39) to offset regular tax liability before general business credits arising in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ordering rules. For purposes of this paragraph (e), credits, including pre-change credits, are considered to offset regular tax liability in the order that such

credits are applied under the ordering rules of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 and section 904. For example, for purposes of this paragraph (e), excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c) (whether or not a pre-change credit) are considered (under section 38(c)) to offset regular tax liability before the general business credit carryovers to the taxable year are considered (under section 39) to offset regular tax liability before general business credits arising in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for credits under section 38(a). For purposes of applying this paragraph (e), credits under section 38(a) that, under section 38(c)(2) as applicable, taking into account amendments made by section 11813 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, effectively offset both regular tax liability and the tax imposed by section 55 (relating to minimum tax), are considered to offset regular tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. For purposes of these examples, the term modified tax liability means the amount determined under paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L, a calendar year taxpayer, has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. Before the application of carryovers, L, a new loss corporation, has $60,000 of capital gain, $100,000 of ordinary taxable income and a section 382 limitation of $100,000 for its first post-change year beginning after the change date. L's only carryovers are an $80,000 capital loss carryover and a $100,000 net operating loss carryover. Both carryovers are from taxable years ending before the change date and thus are pre-change losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> L first uses $60,000 of its pre-change capital loss carryover to offset its capital gain. This reduces its section 382 limitation to $40,000 (i.e., $100,000-$60,000). L's pre-change net operating loss carryover can therefore be used only to the extent of $40,000. L's remaining $20,000 pre-change capital loss carryover and remaining $60,000 pre-change net operating loss carryover are carried to later years to the extent permitted under this section and sections 172, 382(l)(2) and 1212.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L, a calendar year taxpayer, has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. L has $750,000 of ordinary taxable income (before the application of carryovers) and a section 382 limitation of $1,500,000 for 1988. L's only carryovers are from pre-1987 taxable years and consist of a $500,000 net operating loss (``NOL'') carryover and a $200,000 foreign tax credit carryover, all of which may be used under the section 904 limitation. The NOL carryover is a pre-change loss, and the foreign tax credit carryover is a pre-change credit. L has no other credits which can be used for 1988 and is not liable for an alternative minimum tax for 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following computation illustrates the application of this section for 1988:</p><p class="depth0">1.
