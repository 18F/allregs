Except upon objection sustained by the Board for good cause shown, copies of documents may be offered and received into evidence as exhibits, provided they are of equal legibility and quality as the originals, and such copies shall have the same force and effect as if they were the originals. If the Board directs, a party offering a copy of a document as an exhibit shall have the original available at the hearing for examination by the Board and any other party. When the original of a document has been received into evidence as an exhibit, an accurate copy may be substituted in evidence for the original by leave of the Board at any time. The Board may require a party to provide either copies of electronically stored information or printed versions of electronically stored information to be included in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of exhibits and other items.
