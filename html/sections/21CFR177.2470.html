                            <p class="depth0">Polyoxymethylene copolymer identified in this section may be safely  used as an article or component of articles intended for food-contact  use in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. For the purpose of this section, polyoxymethylene  copolymers are identified as the following: The reaction product of  trioxane (cyclic trimer of formaldehyde) and ethylene oxide (CAS Reg.  No. 24969-25-3) or the reaction product of trioxane (cyclic trimer of  formaldehyde) and a maximum of 5 percent by weight of butanediol formal  (CAS Reg. No. 25214 85-1). Both copolymers may have certain optional  substances added to impart desired technological properties to the  copolymer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional adjuvant substances. The polyoxymethylene copolymer  identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain optional  adjuvant substances required in its production. The quantity of any  optional adjuvant substance employed in the production of the copolymer  does not exceed the amount reasonably required to accomplish the  intended technical or physical effect. Such adjuvants may include  substances generally recognized as safe in food, substances used in  accordance with prior sanction, substances permitted under applicable  regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter, and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stabilizers (total amount of stabilizers not to exceed 2.0  percent and amount of any one stabilizer not to exceed 1.0 percent of  polymer by weight)  Calcium ricinoleate. Cyanoguanidine. Hexamethylene bis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy hydro cinnamate) (CAS Reg.  No. 35074-77-2). Melamine-formaldehyde resin. 2,2'-Methylenebis(4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol). Nylon 6/66, weight ratio 2/3. Tetrakis [methylene (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]  methane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lubricant: N,N'Distearoylethyl-enediamine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Poly oxy meth ylene copolymer can be  identified by its characteristic infrared spectrum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimum number average molecular weight of the copolymer is  15,000 as determined by a method titled ``Number Average Molecular  Weight,'' which is incorporated by reference.
