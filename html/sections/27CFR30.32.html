                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Proof obscuration of spirits containing more than 400  but not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters shall be  determined by one of the following methods. The evaporation method may  be used only for spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees at gauge proof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaporation method. Evaporate the water and alcohol from a  carefully measured 25 milliliter sample of spirits, dry the residue at  100 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and then weigh the residue  precisely. Multiply the weight of the residue by 4 to determine the  weight of solids in 100 milliliters. The resulting weight per 100  milliliters multiplied by 4 will give the obscuration. Experience has  shown that 0.1 gram (100 milligrams) of solids per 100 milliliters of  spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees proof will obscure the true proof  by 0.4 of one degree of proof. For example, if the weight of solids  remaining after evaporation of 25 milliliters 0.125 gram, the amount of  solids present in 100 milliliters of the spirits is 0.50 gram (4 times  0.125). The obscuration is 4 times 0.50, which is two degrees of proof.  This value added to the temperature corrected hydrometer reading will  give the true proof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Distillation method. Determine the apparent proof and  temperature of the sample of spirits and then distill a carefully  measured sample in a small laboratory still, and collect a quantity of  the distillate, 1 or 2 milliliters less than the original sample. The  distillate is adjusted to the original temperature and restored to the  original volume by addition of distilled water. The proof of the  restored distillate is then determined by use of a precision hydrometer  and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 30.23 to the  nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference between the proof so  determined and the apparent proof of the undistilled sample is the  obscuration; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pycnometer method. Determine the specific gravity of the  undistilled sample, distill and restore the samples as provided in  paragraph (c) of this section and determine the specific gravity of the  restored distillate by means of a pycnometer. The specific gravities so  obtained will be converted to degrees of proof by interpolation of Table  6 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference in proof so  obtained is the obscuration.
