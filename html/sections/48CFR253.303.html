There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Section 7101-7109), (b) pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their duly authorized representative, or (c) pursuant to the provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department or their authorized representative has granted a right of appeal not contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other departments and agencies by agreement as permitted by law. The Board shall operate under general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and may perform other duties as directed not inconsistent with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0">2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative Judges. There shall be appointed from the Judges of the Board a Chairman and two or more Vice-Chairmen. Appointment of the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen and other Judges of the Board shall be made by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition. The Chairman may designate a Judge of the Board to serve as an Acting Chairman or Acting Vice Chairman.</p><p class="depth0">3. It shall be the duty and obligation of the Judges of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation pertinent thereto.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman shall designate one Judge of each division as the division head. The Chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision process for decision by the senior deciding group. The division heads and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, together with, if applicable, the author of the decision so referred, shall constitute the senior deciding group of the Board. The decision of the Board in cases so referred to the senior deciding group shall be by majority vote of the participating Judges of that group. A majority of the Judges of a division shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the business of each, respectively. Decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote of the Judges of a division participating and the Chairman and a Vice-Chairman, unless the Chairman refers the appeal for decision by the senior deciding group. An appeal involving a small claim as defined by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 may be decided by a single Judge or fewer Judges of the Board than hereinbefore provided for cases of unlimited dollar amount, under accelerated or expedited procedures as provided in the Rules of the Board and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0">5. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the proper performance of its duties. The Board has the authority to issue methods of procedure and rules and regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of appeals and issuance of opinions.</p><p class="depth0">6. Any Judge of the Board or any examiner, designated by the Chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and receive evidence and argument. A Judge of the Board shall have authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. In cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chairman may request orders of the court in the manner prescribed in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0">7. The Chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization of the Board and for its administration. He shall provide within approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-Judge personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the performance of the functions of the Board. The Chairman shall appoint a Recorder of the Board. All personnel shall be responsible to and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Chairman. Judges shall decide cases independently.</p><p class="depth0">8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for administrative support as required for its operations. Administrative support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower control and utilization, personnel administration, security administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an equal basis and to the extent determined by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be reimbursed.</p><p class="depth0">9. Within 30 days following the close of a calendar quarter, the Chairman shall forward a report of the Board's proceedings for the quarter to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition, and to the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency. The Chairman of the Board will also furnish the Secretary of Defense, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, the Secretaries of the Military Departments, and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency, an annual report containing an account of the Board's transactions and proceedings for the preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">10.

Chairman and a Vice Chairman act as members of each division. Hearings may be held by an Administrative Judge or by a duly authorized examiner. Except for appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure (see Rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(c)), the decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the Board, unless the Chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior Deciding Group (consisting of the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, all division heads, and the Judge who drafted the decision), in which event a decision of a majority of that group constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty or significant precedential importance, or that have occasioned serious dispute within the normal division decision process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Board will to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.</p><p class="depth0">Table of Contents</p><p class="depth0">Rules of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals

Appeals</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Taking an Appeal--For appeals subject to the Contract Disputes Act, notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. The appellant (contractor) should also furnish a copy of the notice of appeal to the contracting officer. For appeals not subject to the Contract Disputes Act, the contractor should refer to the Disputes clause in its contract for the time period in which it must file a notice of appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $100,000 or less to the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not provided a decision within that period, or where such a contractor request has not been made and the contracting officer has not issued a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim over $100,000 to the contracting officer or has submitted a claim that involves no monetary amount, and the contracting officer, within 60 days of receipt of the claim, fails to issue a decision or fails to provide the contractor with a reasonable date by which a decision will be issued, and the contracting officer has failed to issue a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A reasonable time shall be determined by taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided by the contractor to support the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where an appeal is before the Board pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of time as is determined by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the contractor may petition the Board to direct the contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time as determined by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contents of Notice of Appeal--A notice of appeal shall indicate that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract by number, the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in

dispute, if any. A copy of the contracting officer's final decision, if any, should be attached to the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal should be signed by the appellant or by the appellant's duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in Rule 6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Docketing of Appeal--When a notice of appeal has been received by the Board, it will be docketed. The Board will provide a written notice of docketing to the appellant and to the Government.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 2. Filing Documents</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Documents may be filed with the Board by the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Governmental Postal Service--Documents may be filed via a governmental postal service. Filing occurs when the document, properly addressed and with sufficient postage, is transferred into the custody of the postal service.

Contact the Recorder before submitting classified documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Electronic Mail--Documents, except appeal files submitted pursuant to Rule 4, hearing exhibits, classified documents, and documents submitted in camera or under a protective order, may be filed via electronic mail (email). Email attachments should be in PDF format and the attachments may not exceed 10 megabytes total. The transmittal email should include the ASBCA docket number(s), if applicable, and the name of the appellant in the ``Subject:'' line. Filing occurs upon receipt by the Board's email server. When a document is successfully filed via email, the document should not also be submitted by any other means, unless so directed by the Board. Submit emails to: asbca.recorder@mail.mil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Facsimile Transmission--Documents, except appeal files submitted pursuant to Rule 4, hearing exhibits, classified documents, and documents submitted in camera or under a protective order, may be filed via facsimile (fax) machine.

When a document is successfully filed via fax, the document should not also be submitted by any other means, unless so directed by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Copies to Opposing Party--The party filing any document with the Board will send a copy to the opposing party unless the Board directs otherwise, noting on the document filed with the Board that a copy has been so furnished.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 3. Service Upon Other Parties</p><p class="depth0">Documents may be served personally or by mail, addressed to the party upon whom service is to be made, unless the parties have agreed to an alternate means of service. Subpoenas shall be served as provided in Rule 22.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of</p><p class="depth0">Appeal File</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Duties of the Government--Within 30 days of notice that an appeal has been filed, the Government shall transmit to the Board and the appellant an appeal file consisting of the documents the Government considers relevant to the appeal, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The decision from which the appeal is taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, plans, and drawings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, including any claim in response to which the decision was issued.</p><p class="depth0">The Government's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duties of the Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the Government's appeal file, the appellant shall transmit to the Board and the Government any documents not contained therein that the appellant considers relevant to the appeal. Appellant's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Organization of Appeal File--Documents in the appeal file may be originals or legible copies, and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, tabbed with sequential numbers, and indexed to identify the contents of the file. Any document without internal page numbers shall have page numbers added. All documents must be in English or include an English translation. Documents shall be submitted in 3-ring binders, with spines not wider than 3 inches wide, with labels identifying the name of the appeal, ASBCA number and tab numbers contained in each volume, on the front and spine of each volume. Each volume shall contain an index of the documents contained in the entire Rule 4 submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Status of Documents in Appeal File--Documents contained in the appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to the admissibility of a particular document reasonably in advance of hearing or, if there is no hearing, of settling the record, or in any case as ordered by the Board. If such objection is made, the Board will constructively remove the document from the appeal file and permit the party offering the document

to move its admission as evidence in accordance with Rules 10, 11, and 13.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 5. Time, Computation, and Extensions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Where practicable, actions should be taken in less time than the time allowed. Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be granted. All requests for extensions of time should be in writing and indicate that the other party was contacted to seek its concurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which the designated period of time begins to run will not be included, but the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, in which event the period will run to the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 6. Pleadings</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board a complaint setting forth simple, concise, and direct statements of each of its claims. The complaint shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim and the dollar amount claimed, if any. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Should the complaint not be timely received, the appellant's claim and notice of appeal may be deemed to set forth its complaint if, in the opinion of the Board, the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, and the parties will be notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Government--Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall file with the Board an answer thereto. The answer shall admit or deny the allegations of the complaint and shall set forth simple, concise, and direct statements of the Government's defenses to each claim asserted by the appellant, including any affirmative defenses. Should the answer not be timely received, the Board may enter a general denial on behalf of the Government, and the parties will be notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Foreign Law--A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give notice in its pleadings or other reasonable written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 10, 11, or 13. The determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Further Pleadings--The Board upon its own initiative or upon motion may order a party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The Board may permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided however, that the objecting party may be granted an opportunity to meet such evidence.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 7. Motions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Motions Generally--The Board may entertain and rule upon motions and may defer ruling as appropriate. The Board will rule on motions so as to secure, to the fullest extent practicable, the informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of appeals. All motions should be filed as separate documents with an appropriate heading describing the motion. Oral argument on motions is subject to the discretion of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Jurisdictional Motions--Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board should be promptly filed. An evidentiary hearing to address disputed jurisdictional facts will be afforded on application of either party or by order of the Board. The Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on the merits. The Board may at any time and on its own initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Summary Judgment Motions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To facilitate disposition of such a motion, the parties should adhere to the following procedures. Where the parties agree that disposition by summary judgment or partial summary judgment is appropriate, they may file a stipulation of all material facts necessary for the Board to rule on the motion. Otherwise, the moving party should file with its motion a ``Statement of Undisputed Material Facts,'' setting forth the claimed undisputed material facts in separate, numbered paragraphs. The non-moving party should file a ``Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact,'' responding to each numbered paragraph proposed, demonstrating, where appropriate, the existence of material facts in dispute and if appropriate propose additional facts. The moving party and the non-moving party should submit a memorandum of law supporting or opposing summary judgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In deciding motions for summary judgment, the Board looks to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. The parties should explicitly state and support by specific evidence all facts and legal

arguments necessary to sustain a party's position. Each party should cite to the record and attach any additional evidence upon which it relies (e.g., affidavits, declarations, excerpts from depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions). The Board may accept a fact properly proposed and supported by one party as undisputed, unless the opposing party properly responds and establishes that it is in dispute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Response to Motions--A non-moving party has 30 days from receipt of a motion to file its response, unless a different period is ordered by the Board. A moving party has 30 days from receipt of a non-moving party's response to file a reply, unless a different period is ordered by the Board.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 8. Discovery</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Policy and Protective Orders--The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. Within 45 days after the pleadings have been filed, the parties must confer concerning each party's discovery needs, including the scheduling of discovery and the production of electronically stored information. Absent stipulation or a Board order, no discovery may be served prior to this conference. Any motion pertaining to a discovery dispute shall include a statement that the movant has in good faith attempted to resolve the discovery dispute without involvement of the Board. In connection with any discovery procedure, the Board may issue orders to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time, and place for discovery, and provisions for governing the disclosure of information or documents. Any discovery under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 16 with respect to sanctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Depositions--When Permitted--Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may take, or the Board may upon motion order the taking of, testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The Board expects the parties to make persons under their control available for deposition. The motion for an order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depositions--Orders--The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Depositions--Use as Evidence--No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent can testify at the hearing. The deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at a hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board may receive depositions to supplement the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Depositions--Expenses--Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with the taking of any deposition, absent an agreement by the parties or a Board order to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Depositions--Subpoenas--Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions, Requests for Production--Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may serve, or the Board may upon motion order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A request for the admission of specified facts and/or of the authenticity of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service, the factual statements and/or the authenticity of the documents to be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A request for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, electronic or otherwise, or objects, not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 9. Pre-Hearing or Pre-Submission Conference</p><p class="depth0">The Board may, upon its own initiative, or upon the request of either party, arrange a conference or order the parties to appear before an Administrative Judge or examiner for a conference to address any issue related to the prosecution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 10. Hearings</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Where and When Held--Hearings will be held at such times and places determined by the Board to best serve the interests of the parties and the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unexcused Absence--The unexcused absence of a party at the time and place set for hearing will not be occasion for delay. In the event of such absence, the hearing will proceed and the evidentiary record will consist solely of the evidence of record at the conclusion of the hearing, except as ordered otherwise by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nature of Hearings--Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. The parties may offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound

discretion of the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner. The Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding on the Board but may guide the Board's rulings. The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in addition to that offered by the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examination of Witnesses--Witnesses will be examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony of a witness is not given under oath or affirmation, the Board may advise the witness that his or her testimony may be subject to any provision of law imposing penalties for knowingly making false representations in connection with claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interpreters--In appropriate cases, the Board may order that an interpreter be used. An interpreter must be qualified and must be placed under oath or affirmation to give a complete and true translation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Transcripts--Testimony and argument at hearings will be reported verbatim, unless the Board otherwise orders. The Board will contract for a reporter. No other recordings of the proceedings will be made.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 11. Submission Without a Hearing</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Either party may elect to waive a hearing and to submit its case upon the record. Submission of a case without hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed in addition to the Rule 4 file if moved and accepted into evidence. Such submissions may be supplemented by briefs. The Board may designate, with notice to the parties, any document to be made part of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As appropriate, the Board may also rely on pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda, orders, briefs, stipulations and other documents contained in the Board's file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as the Board may otherwise order, no evidence will be received after notification by the Board that the record is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The weight to be given to any evidence will rest within the discretion of the Board. The Board may require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The record will at all reasonable times be available for inspection by the parties at the offices of the Board.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 12.

The details of this procedure appear in section 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect the Accelerated procedure rather than the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure for any appeal where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In appeals where the amount in dispute is $100,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an Accelerated procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure.

Any other documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with times specified in that Rule unless the Board otherwise directs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of the appellant's notice of election, the assigned Administrative Judge should take the following actions, if feasible, in a pre-hearing conference:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify and simplify the issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establish a simplified procedure, including discovery, appropriate to the particular appeal involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine whether either party elects a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Establish an expedited schedule for the timely resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct a hearing, or if no hearing is elected, to close the record on a date that will allow the timely issuance of the decision. The Board may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed under these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Written decisions by the Board in appeals processed under the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure will be short and will contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge. If there has been a hearing, the Administrative Judge presiding at the hearing may at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral argument as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties an authenticated copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A decision under Rule 12.2 shall have no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud, shall be final and conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 Accelerated Procedure</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In appeals proceeding under the Accelerated procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed under these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 180-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Within 30 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of the appellant's notice of election, the assigned Administrative Judge should take the following actions, if feasible, in a pre-hearing conference:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify and simplify the issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establish a simplified procedure, including discovery, appropriate to the particular appeal involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine whether either party elects a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Establish an accelerated schedule for the timely resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Written decisions by the Board in appeals processed under the Accelerated procedure will normally be short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions.

Settling the Record in Appeals With a Hearing</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered consists of the documents admitted under Rule 4, the documents admitted into evidence as hearing exhibits, together with the hearing transcript. The Board may designate with notice to the parties, any document to be made part of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As appropriate, the Board may also rely on pleadings, pre-hearing conference memoranda, orders, briefs, stipulations, and other documents contained in the Board's file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as the Board may otherwise order, no evidence will be received after completion of an oral hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The weight to be given to any evidence will rest within the discretion of the Board. The Board may require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The record will at all reasonable times be available for inspection by the parties at the offices of the Board.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 14. Briefs</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pre-Hearing Briefs--The Board may require the parties to submit pre-hearing briefs. If the Board does not require pre-hearing briefs, either party may, upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a pre-hearing brief to the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Post-Hearing Briefs--Post-hearing briefs may be submitted upon such terms as may be directed by the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner at the conclusion of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 15.

Dismissal or Default for Failure to Prosecute or Defend</p><p class="depth0">Whenever the record discloses the failure of either party to file documents required by these Rules, respond to notices or correspondence from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute. In the case of a default by the Government, the Board may issue an order to show cause why the Board should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 16. If good cause is not shown, the Board may take appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 18. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Board may suspend the proceedings by agreement of the parties for settlement discussions, or for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In certain cases, appeals docketed before the Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may dismiss such appeals from its docket for a period of time without prejudice to their restoration. Unless either party or the Board moves to reinstate the appeal within the time period set forth in the dismissal order, or if no time period is set forth, within one year from the date of the dismissal order, the dismissal shall be deemed to be with prejudice.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 19. Decisions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Decisions of the Board will be made in writing and authenticated copies of the decision will be sent simultaneously to both parties. All orders and decisions, except those as may be required by law to be held confidential, will be available to the public.

If the parties do not contemplate an appeal or motion for reconsideration, they will execute the forms indicating that no judicial review will be sought. The Government agency will forward the required forms with a copy of the decision to the Department of the Treasury for certification of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When the parties settle an appeal in favor of the appellant, they may file with the Board a stipulation setting forth the amount of the settlement due to the appellant. By joint motion, the parties may request that the Board issue a decision in the nature of a consent judgment, awarding the stipulated amount to the appellant. These decisions will be processed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> After a decision has become final the Board may, upon request of a party and after notice to the other party, grant the withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part thereof. The Board may require the substitution of true copies of exhibits or any part thereof as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0">Rule 20. Motion for Reconsideration</p><p class="depth0">A motion for reconsideration may be filed by either party. It shall set forth specifically the grounds relied upon to grant the motion. The motion must be filed within 30 days from the date of the receipt of a copy of the decision of the Board by the party filing the motion. An opposing party must file any cross-motion for reconsideration within 30 days from its receipt of the motion for reconsideration. Extensions in the period to file a motion will not be granted.

desired third-party books, records, documents, or tangible things whenever possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General--Upon written request of either party, or on his or her own initiative, an Administrative Judge may issue a subpoena requiring:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Testimony at a deposition--The deposing of a witness in the city or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business in person, or at another location convenient for the witness that is specifically determined by the Board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testimony at a hearing--The attendance of a witness for the purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Production of books and records--The production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and records (including electronically stored information and other tangible things) designated in the subpoena.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Request for Subpoena--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A request for subpoena shall normally be filed at least:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a witness at a deposition is sought; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board may honor a request for subpoena not made within the time limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this Rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and records sought. The Board may require resubmission of a request that does not provide this information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requests to Quash or Modify--Upon written request by the person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Board may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive or for other good cause shown, or require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy of the request has been served upon the opposing party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Form of Subpoena--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the caption of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified books and records at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the Administrative Judge will sign the subpoena, enter the name of the witness and may otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served in any state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law. However, where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, payment need not be tendered in advance of attendance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for striking such evidence as the Board deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena--In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, the Board may apply to the Court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board to give testimony or produce evidence or both.

The Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 7105(g)(1), states that boards of contract appeals ``shall . . . to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.'' Resolution of a dispute at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. To that end, the parties are encouraged to consider Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as well as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADRs for any Federal agency. However, if the matter is not pending before the Board under its CDA jurisdiction, any settlement may not be paid out of the Judgment Fund.</p><p class="depth0">2. The ADR methods described in this Addendum are intended to suggest techniques that have worked in the past. Any appropriate method that brings the parties together in settlement, or partial settlement, of their disputes is a good method. The ADR methods listed are not intended to preclude the parties' use of other ADR techniques that do not require the Board's participation, such as settlement negotiations, fact-finding conferences or procedures, mediation, or minitrials not involving use of the Board's personnel. Any method, or combination of methods, including one that will result in a binding decision, may be selected by the parties without regard to the dollar amount in dispute.</p><p class="depth0">3. The parties must jointly request ADR procedures at the Board. The request must be approved by the Board. The Board may also schedule a conference to explore the desirability and selection of an ADR method and related procedures. If an ADR involving the Board's participation is requested and

approved by the Board, a Neutral will be appointed. If an Administrative Judge has already been assigned to an appeal, the same judge will normally be assigned to be the Neutral in an ADR. If an Administrative Judge has not yet been assigned to the appeal, or if the subject of the ADR is a matter pending before the contracting officer prior to any appeal, the Board will appoint an Administrative Judge to be the Neutral. In such instances, as well as situations in which the parties prefer that an assigned Administrative Judge not be appointed to serve as the Neutral, the parties may submit a list of at least three preferred Administrative Judges and the Board will endeavor to accommodate their preferences.</p><p class="depth0">4. To facilitate full, frank and open discussion and presentations, any Neutral who has participated in a non-binding ADR procedure that has failed to resolve the underlying dispute will be recused from further participation in the matter unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing and the Board concurs. Further, the recused Neutral will not discuss the merits of the dispute or substantive matters involved in the ADR proceedings with other Board personnel.</p><p class="depth0">5. Written material prepared specifically for use in an ADR proceeding, oral presentations made at an ADR proceeding, and all discussions in connection with such proceedings between the parties and the Neutral are confidential and, unless otherwise specifically agreed by the parties, inadmissible as evidence in any pending or future Board proceeding involving the parties or matter in dispute. However, evidence otherwise admissible before the Board is not rendered inadmissible because of its use in the ADR proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">6. The ADR method and the procedures and requirements implementing the ADR method will be prescribed by the written agreement of the parties and approved by the Board. ADR methods can be used successfully at any stage of the litigation.</p><p class="depth0">7. The following are examples of ADR methods commonly used at the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonbinding--</p><p class="depth0">Mediations: A Neutral is an Administrative Judge who will not normally hear or have any formal or informal decision-making authority in the matter and who is appointed for the purpose of facilitating settlement. In many circumstances, settlement can be fostered by a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position with the Neutral. The agenda for meetings with the Neutral will be flexible to accommodate the requirements of the case. To further the settlement effort, the Neutral may meet with the parties either jointly or individually. A Neutral's recommendations are not binding on the parties. When this method is selected, the ADR agreement must contain a provision in which the parties and counsel agree not to subpoena the Neutral in any legal action or administrative proceeding of any kind to produce any notes or documents related to the ADR proceeding or to testify concerning any such notes or documents or concerning his/her thoughts or impressions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Binding--</p><p class="depth0">Summary Proceeding With Binding Decision: A summary proceeding with binding decision is a procedure whereby the resolution of the appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an Administrative Judge. A binding ``bench'' decision may be issued upon conclusion of the proceeding, or a binding summary written decision will be issued by the judge no later than ten days following the later of conclusion of the proceeding or receipt of a transcript. The parties must agree in the ADR agreement that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the Board under this method shall be final, conclusive, not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. All such decisions, rulings, and orders will have no precedential value. Pre-hearing, hearing, and post-hearing procedures and rules applicable to appeals generally will be modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other Agreed Methods--</p><p class="depth0">The parties and the Board may agree upon other informal methods, binding or nonbinding that are structured and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual case.</p><p class="depth0">8. The above-listed ADR procedures are intended to shorten and simplify the Board's more formalized procedures. Generally, if the parties resolve their dispute by agreement, they benefit in terms of cost and time savings and maintenance or restoration of amicable relations. The Board will not view the parties' participation in ADR proceedings as a sign of weakness. Any method adopted for dispute resolution depends upon both parties having a firm, good faith commitment to resolve their differences. Absent such intention, the best structured dispute resolution procedure is unlikely to be successful.

F-101 General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, preparation, and distribution of the Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) Receiving Report, the WAWF Energy RR, and commercial shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance. The WAWF RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for waterborne shipments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS 232.7002(a)) because use of the WAWF RR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of supplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing list or when a signed copy is required.F-102 Applicability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, requires payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF in nearly all cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this appendix also apply to supplies or services acquired by DoD when the clause at DFARS 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is included in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.F-103 Use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The WAWF RR and the DD Form 250 are multipurpose reports used--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or destination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To provide evidence of acceptance at origin, destination, or other;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For packing lists;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For receiving;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For shipping;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> As a contractor invoice (the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 alone cannot be used as an invoice, however the option exists to create an invoice from the Receiving Report or a Combo (Invoice and Receiving Report) both of which minimize data entry); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> As commercial invoice support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Do not use the WAWF RR or the DD Form 250 for shipments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By subcontractors, unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Of contract inventory. The WAWF Property Transfer document should be used for this type of shipment. Training for the preparation of this document type is available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil, under the Property Transfer and Receipt section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The contractor prepares the WAWF RR or the DD Form 250, except for entries that an authorized Government representative is required to complete. When using a paper DD Form 250, the contractor shall furnish sufficient copies of the completed form, as directed by the Government representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Use the WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For bulk movements of petroleum products by tanker or barge to cover--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at product source. Annotate the forms with

the words ``INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In addition to the above uses, the WAWF RR provides additional functionality, not provided by the paper DD Form 250 that complies with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Item Unique Identification (IUID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation is used in the contract, reporting of IUID data is required. WAWF captures the IUID data and forwards the data to the IUID registry after acceptance. WAWF shall be used to report Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) at the line item level, unless an exception to WAWF applies, and can also be used to report UIIs embedded at the line item level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7006, Radio Frequency Identification, is used in the contract, WAWF will capture the RFID information and forward the data to the receiving location. Using WAWF is the only way a contractor can comply with the clause to furnish RFID data via an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN). The RFID information may be added at time of submission, or via the WAWF Pack Later functionality after acceptance.F-104 Application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> WAWF RR and DD Form 250. (1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, which indicate no DD Form 250 is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, which indicate no DD Form 250 is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR or DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal supply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF RR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a minimum--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The shipper;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Shipping point;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Consignee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Contract and line item number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Product identification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Gross gallons (bulk only);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Loading temperature (bulk only);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Identification of carrier's equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Serial number of all seals applied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Signature of supplier's representative.
When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) before signing Block 21b.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States applies, except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than one contract line item in each WAWF RR or DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and acceptance data are the same for all line items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD 250. Contractors may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, on one WAWF RR or DD 250. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as a minimum--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The shipper;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name or names;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which the coal originates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The contract number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The exact size of the coal shipped; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the truckload.</p><p class="depth0">Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify

each railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1. (1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same destination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product loaded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each grade of product discharged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.</p><p class="depth0">Part 2_Contract Quality Assurance on Shipments Between Contractors

A copy of the record which formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such withholding.H-102 Nature of proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor.</p><p class="depth0">The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.H-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the

foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to the contractor's present responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of the debarment.H-104 Fact-finding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.H-105 Timing requirements.</p><p class="depth0">All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.H-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's representative, and the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire administrative record, including the findings of fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
INQUIRIES</p><p class="depth0">For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency.
