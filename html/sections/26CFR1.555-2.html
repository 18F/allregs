                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If, for any taxable year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A foreign corporation meets the stock ownership requirement specified in section 552(a)(2) and Sec. 1.552-3, regardless of whatever day in its taxable year is the last day on which the required United States group exists, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such foreign corporation is a shareholder in a foreign personal holding company on any day of a taxable year of the second company which ends with or within the taxable year of the first company and such day is the last day in the taxable year of the second company in which the United States group exists with respect to the second company, then for the purpose of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining whether the first company meets the specified gross income requirement so as to come within the classification of a foreign personal holding company, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the first company which (in the event the first company is a foreign personal holding company) is to be included, in whole or in part, in the gross income of its shareholders, whether United States shareholders or other foreign personal holding companies

there shall be included as a dividend in the gross income of the first company for the taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of the second company ends, the amount the first company would have received as a dividend, if on the last day referred to in this subparagraph there had been distributed by the second company, and received by the shareholders, an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the second company for its taxable year as the portion of such taxable year up to and including such last day bears to the entire taxable year. The foregoing rules apply to any chain of foreign corporations regardless of the number of corporations included in the chain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The application of section 555(b) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The X Corporation is a foreign corporation whose stock is owned by A, a United States citizen. The X Corporation owns the entire stock of the Y Corporation, another foreign corporation. The taxable year of the X Corporation is the calendar year and the taxable year of the Y Corporation is the fiscal year ending June 30. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, more than the required percentage of the Y Corporation's gross income consists of foreign personal holding company income and no part of the earnings for such year is distributed as dividends. On the basis of these facts the Y Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955. The X Corporation meets the stock ownership requirement and constitutes a foreign personal holding company for 1955, if it also meets the gross income requirement. For the purpose of determining whether the X Corporation meets the gross income requirements, the entire undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, must be included as a dividend in the gross income of the X Corporation for 1955, since:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The X Corporation was a shareholder in the Y Corporation on a day (June 30, 1955) in the taxable year of the Y Corporation ending with or within the taxable year of the X Corporation, which day was the last day in the taxable year of the Y Corporation on which the United States group required with respect to the Y Corporation existed,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such last day was also the end of the Y Corporation's taxable year so that the portion of the taxable year of the Y Corporation up to and including such last day is equal to 100 percent of the taxable year of the Y Corporation, and, therefore, the portion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation includible in the gross income of its shareholders is likewise equal to 100 percent, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The X Corporation being the sole shareholder of the Y Corporation must include such portion in its gross income for 1955, the taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of the Y Corporation ends. If, after the inclusion of the presumptive dividend in its gross income, the X Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for 1955, then the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation must also be included as a dividend in the gross income of the X Corporation in determining its undistributed foreign personal holding company income which is to be included in the gross income of A, the sole shareholder in the X Corporation. On the other hand, if, after including such presumptive dividend, the X Corporation does not constitute a foreign personal holding company, the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation is not includible in the gross income of the X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The X Corporation referred to in example 1 sold the stock in the Y Corporation to other interests on September 30, 1955, so that after that date no United States group existed with respect to the Y Corporation. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, more than the required percentage of the gross income of the Y Corporation consists of foreign personal holding company income. The taxable income of the Y Corporation for such fiscal year amounts to $1,000,000, of which $900,000 is distributed in dividends after September 30, 1955. The undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation for such fiscal year amounts to $100,000. Upon the basis of these facts the Y Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, since at one time in such fiscal year, or from July 1 to and including September 30, 1955, it meets the stock ownership requirement, and the gross income requirement is also satisfied. In determining whether the X Corporation constitutes a foreign personal holding company for 1956, a portion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956 (three-

twelfths of $100,000, or $25,000), must be included as a dividend in the gross income of the X Corporation, since:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The X Corporation was a shareholder in the Y Corporation on September 30, 1955, or on a day in the taxable year of the Y Corporation ending with or within the taxable year of the X Corporation which day was the last day in the Y Corporation's taxable year on which the United States group required with respect to the Y Corporation existed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The portion of the taxable year of the Y Corporation up to and including such day is three-twelfths of the entire taxable year of the Y Corporation and, therefore, the portion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation includible in the gross income of its shareholders also is equal to three-twelfths, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The X Corporation, being the sole shareholder of the Y Corporation at the time the United States group with respect to the Y Corporation last existed, must include all of such portion in its gross income for 1956, the taxable year of the X Corporation in which or with which the taxable year of the Y Corporation ends

It is to be observed that three-twelfths of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation for the entire taxable year and not the earnings realized by the Y Corporation up to and including September 30, 1955, the last day on which the United States group with respect to the Y Corporation existed, must be included in the gross income of the X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The X Corporation referred to in example 1 sold the stock in the Y Corporation to other interests on September 30, 1955, so that after that date a different United States group existed with respect to the Y Corporation. Assuming that the Y Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, no part of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation for such fiscal year would, in this instance, be includible in the gross income of the X Corporation for the year 1956, in determining whether the X Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for that year. In such case, the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporation is includible in the gross income of the other foreign personal holding companies, if any, and of the United States shareholders who are shareholders in the Y Corporation the day after September 30, 1955, which was the last day in the taxable year of the Y Corporation on which the United States group withrespect to the Y Corporation existed. If, however, the X Corporation sells 90percent of its stock in the Y Corporation and thus is a minority shareholder in the Y Corporation on the last day of the taxable year of the Y Corporation on which the United States group with respect to the Y Corporation exists, the portion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income allocable to the minority interests of the X Corporation would be includible in the gross income of the X Corporation, even though on such last day the United States group is not the same with respect to both corporations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. If the Y Corporation in example 1 owns all of the stock of the Z Corporation, another foreign corporation, there would be a chain of three foreign corporations. In such case, assuming that the Z Corporation is a foreign personal holding company for a taxable year ending with or within the taxable year of the Y Corporation, the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Z Corporation would be included in the gross income of the Y Corporation for the purpose of determining whether the Y Corporation comes within the classification of a foreign personal holding company. If, after the inclusion of such presumptive dividend, the Y Corporation is a foreign personal holding company, the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Z Corporation would be included in the gross income of the Y Corporation in determining the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Y Corporationwhich is includible in the gross income of its shareholder, the X Corporation. The same process would be repeated with respect to determining whether the X Corporation is a foreign personal holding company and in determining its undistributed foreign personal holding company income. If all three corporations are foreign personal holding companies, the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of each would, in this manner, be reflected as a dividend in the gross income of A, the ultimate beneficial shareholder of the chain. In the event that after the inclusion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the Z Corporation in the gross income of the Y Corporation, the Y Corporation is not a foreign personal holding company, then no part of the income of either the Z Corporation or the Y Corporation would be includible in the gross income of the X Corporation. In that event, whether the X Corporation is a foreign personal holding company, and its undistributed foreign personal holding company income, would be determined independently of the income of the Y Corporation and the Z Corporation.</p>
