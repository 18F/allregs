                            <p class="depth0">Contracts with Pinkerton Detective Agencies or similar organizations  are prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 3108. This prohibition applies only to  contracts with organizations that offer quasi-military armed forces for  hire, or with their employees, regardless of the contract's character.  An organization providing guard or protective services does not thereby  become a quasi-military armed force, even though the guards are armed or  the organization provides general investigative or detective services.  (See 57 Comp. Gen. 524).</p>
