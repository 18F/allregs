If the taxable year with respect to which the deficiency  is asserted began before January 1, 1954, the deficiency dividends  deduction shall include only the amounts which would have been  includible in the computation of the basic surtax credit for such  taxable year under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Section 547(g),  relating to the denial of a deficiency dividends deduction if the  determination contains a finding that any part of the deficiency is due  to fraud, etc., shall apply only if the taxable year with respect to  which the deficiency is asserted begins after December 31, 1953.</p><p class="depth0">Foreign Personal Holding Companies</p>
