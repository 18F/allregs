A unit is defined as one side of one sheet, one color only (with black counting as a color), with a maximum image size of 10\3/4\ by 14\1/4\ inches on a maximum paper size of 11 by 17 inches. Examples of counting the number of units: black plus one additional color on one side of one page counts as two units. Three colors (including black) on two sides of one page count as six units.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p>
