Its moisture content is not more than 15 percent. In its preparation particles of ground corn which contain germ may be separated, reground, and recombined with all or part of the material from which it was separated, but in any such case the fat content of the finished bolted white corn meal does not exceed by more than 0.3 percent the fat content of the cleaned corn from which it was ground. The contents of crude fiber and fat in all the foregoing provisions relating thereto are on a moisture-free basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of this section, moisture, fat and crude fiber are determined by the methods therefor referred to in Sec. 137.250(b)(1).</p>
