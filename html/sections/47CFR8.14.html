                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Complaints. In addition to the general pleading requirements,  complaints must adhere to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certificate of service. Complaints shall be accompanied by a  certificate of service on any defendant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement of relief requested--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The complaint shall state the  relief requested. It shall state fully and precisely all pertinent facts  and considerations relied on to demonstrate the need for the relief  requested and to support a determination that a grant of such relief  would serve the public interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The complaint shall set forth all steps taken by the parties to  resolve the problem.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A complaint may, on request of the filing party, be dismissed  without prejudice as a matter of right prior to the adoption date of any  final action taken by the Commission with respect to the petition or  complaint. A request for the return of an initiating document will be  regarded as a request for dismissal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to prosecute. Failure to prosecute a complaint, or  failure to respond to official correspondence or request for additional  information, will be cause for dismissal. Such dismissal will be without  prejudice if it occurs prior to the adoption date of any final action  taken by the Commission with respect to the initiating pleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Answers to complaints. Unless otherwise directed by the  Commission, any party who is served with a complaint shall file an  answer in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The answer shall be filed within 20 days of service of the  complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The answer shall advise the parties and the Commission fully and  completely of the nature of any and all defenses, and shall respond  specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Collateral or  immaterial issues shall be avoided in answers and every effort should be  made to narrow the issues. Any party against whom a complaint is filed  failing to file and serve an answer within the time and in the manner  prescribed by these rules may be deemed in default and an order may be  entered against defendant in accordance with the allegations contained  in the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The answer shall admit or deny the averments on which the  adverse party relies. If the defendant is without knowledge or  information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment,  the defendant shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. When a  defendant intends in good faith to deny only part of an averment, the  answer shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the  remainder, and state in detail the basis of that denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Averments in a complaint are deemed to be admitted when not  denied in the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reply. In addition to the general pleading requirements, replies  must adhere to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complainant may file a reply to a responsive pleading that  shall be served on the defendant and shall also contain a detailed full  showing, supported by affidavit, of any additional facts or  considerations relied on. Unless expressly permitted by the Commission,  replies shall not contain new matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to reply will not be deemed an admission of any  allegations contained in the responsive   pleading, except with respect to any affirmative defense set forth  therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, replies must be  filed within ten (10) days after submission of the responsive pleading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Motions. Except as provided in this section, or upon a showing  of extraordinary circumstances, additional motions or pleadings by any  party will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional procedures and written submissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  Commission may specify other procedures, such as oral argument or  evidentiary hearing directed to particular aspects, as it deems  appropriate. In the event that an evidentiary hearing is required, the  Commission will determine, on the basis of the pleadings and such other  procedures as it may specify, whether temporary relief should be  afforded any party pending the hearing and the nature of any such  temporary relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional  information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious  resolution of the proceeding, including copies of all contracts and  documents reflecting arrangements and understandings alleged to violate  the requirements set forth in the Communications Act and in this part,  as well as affidavits and exhibits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may, in its discretion, require the parties to  file briefs summarizing the facts and issues presented in the pleadings  and other record evidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> These briefs shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions  of law which that party is urging the Commission to adopt, with specific  citations to the record, and supported by relevant authority and  analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The schedule for filing any briefs shall be at the discretion  of the Commission. Unless ordered otherwise by the Commission, such  briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reply briefs may be submitted at the discretion of the  Commission. Unless ordered otherwise by the Commission, reply briefs  shall not exceed thirty (30) pages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discovery. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission may in its discretion order  discovery limited to the issues specified by the Commission. Such  discovery may include answers to written interrogatories, depositions,  document production, or requests for admissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may in its discretion direct the parties to  submit discovery proposals, together with a memorandum in support of the  discovery requested. Such discovery requests may include answers to  written interrogatories, admissions, document production, or  depositions. The Commission may hold a status conference with the  parties, pursuant to Sec. 8.15, to determine the scope of discovery, or  direct the parties regarding the scope of discovery. If the Commission  determines that extensive discovery is required or that depositions are  warranted, the Commission may advise the parties that the proceeding  will be referred to an administrative law judge in accordance with  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Request for written opinion from outside technical organization.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After reviewing the pleadings, and at any stage of the proceeding  thereafter, the Enforcement Bureau may, in its discretion, request a  written opinion from an outside technical organization regarding one or  more issues in dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Wherever possible, the opinion shall be requested from an  outside technical organization whose members do not include any of the  parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no such outside technical organization exists, or if the  Enforcement Bureau in its discretion chooses to request an opinion from  an organization that includes among its members a party to the  proceeding, the Bureau shall instruct the organization that any  representative of a party to the proceeding within the organization may  not participate in either the organization's consideration of the  issue(s) referred or its drafting of the opinion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No outside technical organization shall be required to respond  to the Bureau's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an opinion from an outside technical organization is  requested and the request is accepted, the Enforcement Bureau shall  notify the parties to the dispute of the request within ten (10) days  and shall provide them copies of the opinion once it is received.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The outside technical organization shall provide its opinion  within thirty (30) days of the Enforcement Bureau's request, unless  otherwise specified by the Bureau.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Parties shall be given the opportunity to file briefs in reply  to the opinion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Referral to administrative law judge. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After reviewing the  pleadings, and at any stage of the proceeding thereafter, the Commission  may, in its discretion, designate any proceeding or discrete issues  arising out of any proceeding for an adjudicatory hearing before an  administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before designation for hearing, the Commission shall notify,  either orally or in writing, the parties to the proceeding of its intent  to so designate, and the parties shall be given a period of ten (10)  days to elect to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute  resolution procedures, or to proceed with an adjudicatory hearing. Such  election shall be submitted in writing to the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, or upon motion by  the Enforcement Bureau Chief, the Enforcement Bureau Chief shall not be  deemed to be a party to a proceeding designated for a hearing before an  administrative law judge pursuant to this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commission ruling. The Commission (or the Enforcement Bureau on  delegated authority), after consideration of the pleadings, shall issue  an order ruling on the complaint.
