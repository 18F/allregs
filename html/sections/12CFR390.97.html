                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart, which implements section 36(g)(4) of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), (12 U.S.C. 1831m(g)(4)), provides  rules and procedures for the removal, suspension, or debarment of  independent public accountants and their accounting firms from  performing independent audit and attestation services required by  section 36 of the FDIA for insured State savings associations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have  the meaning given below unless the context requires otherwise:</p><p class="depth2">Accounting firm. The term accounting firm means a corporation,  proprietorship, partnership, or other business firm providing audit  services.</p><p class="depth2">Audit services. The term audit services means any service required  to be performed by an independent public accountant by section 36 of the  FDIA and part 363, including attestation services. Audit services  include any service performed with respect to a savings and loan holding  company of a State savings association that is used to satisfy  requirements imposed by section 36 of the FDIA or part 363 on that State  savings association.</p><p class="depth2">Independent public accountant. The term independent public  accountant means any individual who performs or participates in  providing audit services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Removal, suspension, or debarment of independent public  accountants. The FDIC may remove, suspend, or debar an independent  public accountant from performing audit services for State savings  associations that are subject to section 36 of the FDIA if, after  service   of a notice of intention and opportunity for hearing in the matter, the  FDIC finds that the independent public accountant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lacks the requisite qualifications to perform audit services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has knowingly or recklessly engaged in conduct that results in a  violation of applicable professional standards, including those  standards and conflicts of interest provisions applicable to independent  public accountants through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Law  107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002) (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and developed by the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and  Exchange Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has engaged in negligent conduct in the form of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in  a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in  which an independent public accountant knows, or should know, that  heightened scrutiny is warranted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a  violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of  competence to perform audit services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has knowingly or recklessly given false or misleading  information or knowingly or recklessly participated in any way in the  giving of false or misleading information to the FDIC or any officer or  employee of the FDIC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has engaged in, or aided and abetted, a material and knowing or  reckless violation of any provision of the Federal banking or securities  laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Has been removed, suspended, or debarred from practice before  any federal or state agency regulating the banking, insurance, or  securities industries, other than by action listed in paragraph (j) of  this section, on grounds relevant to the provision of audit services; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Is suspended or debarred for cause from practice as an  accountant by any duly constituted licensing authority of any state,  possession, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Removal, suspension or debarment of an accounting firm. If the  FDIC determines that there is good cause for the removal, suspension, or  debarment of a member or employee of an accounting firm under paragraph  (c) of this section, the FDIC also may remove, suspend, or debar such  firm or one or more offices of such firm. In considering whether to  remove, suspend, or debar an accounting firm or office thereof, and the  term of any sanction against an accounting firm under this section, the  FDIC may consider, for example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gravity, scope, or repetition of the act or failure to act  that constitutes good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The adequacy of, and adherence to, applicable policies,  practices, or procedures for the accounting firm's conduct of its  business and the performance of audit services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The selection, training, supervision, and conduct of members or  employees of the accounting firm involved in the performance of audit  services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which managing partners or senior officers of the  accounting firm have participated, directly or indirectly through  oversight or review, in the act or failure to act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which the accounting firm has, since the  occurrence of the act or failure to act, implemented corrective internal  controls to prevent its recurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remedies. The remedies provided in this section are in addition  to any other remedies the FDIC may have under any other applicable  provisions of law, rule, or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proceedings to remove, suspend, or debar. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC may  initiate a proceeding to remove, suspend, or debar an independent public  accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services by issuing  a written notice of intention to take such action that names the  individual or firm as a respondent and describes the nature of the  conduct that constitutes good cause for such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An independent public accountant or accounting firm named as a  respondent in the notice issued under paragraph (f)(1) of this section  may request a hearing on the allegations in the notice. Hearings  conducted under this paragraph shall be conducted in the   same manner as other hearings under the Uniform Rules of Practice and  Procedure contained in subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Immediate suspension from performing audit services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  FDIC serves written notice of intention to remove, suspend, or debar an  independent public accountant or accounting firm from performing audit  services, the FDIC may, with due regard for the public interest and  without preliminary hearing, immediately suspend an independent public  accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services for savings  associations, if the FDIC:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has a reasonable basis to believe that the independent public  accountant or accounting firm engaged in conduct (specified in the  notice served upon the independent public accountant or accounting firm  under paragraph (f) of this section) that would constitute grounds for  removal, suspension, or debarment under paragraph (c) or (d) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determines that immediate suspension is necessary to avoid  immediate harm to an insured depository institution or its depositors or  to the depository system as a whole; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Serves such independent public accountant or accounting firm  with written notice of the immediate suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An immediate suspension notice issued under this paragraph will  become effective upon service. Such suspension will remain in effect  until the date the FDIC dismisses the charges contained in the notice of  intention, or the effective date of a final order of removal,  suspension, or debarment issued by the FDIC to the independent public  accountant or accounting firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Petition to stay. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any independent public accountant or  accounting firm immediately suspended from performing audit services in  accordance with paragraph (g) of this section may, within 10 calendar  days after service of the notice of immediate suspension, file a  petition with the FDIC for a stay of such suspension. If no petition is  filed within 10 calendar days, the immediate suspension shall remain in  effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of a stay petition, the FDIC will designate a  presiding officer who shall fix a place and time (not more than 10  calendar days after receipt of such petition, unless extended at the  request of the petitioner), at which the immediately suspended party may  appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials and  oral argument. Any FDIC employee engaged in investigative or prosecuting  functions for the FDIC in a case may not, in that or a factually related  case, serve as a presiding officer or participate or advise in the  decision of the presiding officer or of the FDIC, except as witness or  counsel in the proceeding. In the sole discretion of the presiding  officer, upon a specific showing of compelling need, oral testimony of  witnesses may also be presented. In hearings held pursuant to this  paragraph, there will be no discovery and the provisions of Sec. Sec.  390.35 through 390.41, 390.45, and 390.50 of the Uniform Rules will  apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 30 calendar days after the hearing, the presiding officer  shall issue a decision. The presiding officer will grant a stay upon a  demonstration that a substantial likelihood exists of the respondent's  success on the issues raised by the notice of intention and that, absent  such relief, the respondent will suffer immediate and irreparable  injury, loss, or damage. In the absence of such a demonstration, the  presiding officer will notify the parties that the immediate suspension  will be continued pending the completion of the administrative  proceedings pursuant to the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parties may seek review of the presiding officer's decision  by filing a petition for review with the presiding officer within 10  calendar days after service of the decision. Replies must be filed  within 10 calendar days after the petition filing date. Upon receipt of  a petition for review and any reply, the presiding officer must promptly  certify the entire record to the Board of Directors. Within 60 calendar  days of the presiding officer's certification, the Board of Directors  shall issue an order notifying the affected party whether or not the  immediate suspension should be continued or reinstated. The order shall  state the basis of the Board of Director's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Scope of any order of removal, suspension, or debarment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, any independent  public accountant or accounting firm that has been removed, suspended  (including an immediate suspension), or debarred from performing audit  services by the FDIC may not, while such order is in effect, perform  audit services for any State savings association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An order of removal, suspension (including an immediate  suspension), or debarment may, at the discretion of the FDIC, be made  applicable to a limited number of State savings associations. (limited  scope order).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Automatic removal, suspension, and debarment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An independent  public accountant or accounting firm may not perform audit services for  a State savings association if the independent public accountant or  accounting firm:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is subject to a final order of removal, suspension, or debarment  (other than a limited scope order) issued by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, or the FDIC  under section 36 of the FDIA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is subject to a temporary suspension or permanent revocation of  registration or a temporary or permanent suspension or bar from further  association with any registered public accounting firm issued by the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the Securities and Exchange  Commission under sections 105(c)(4)(A) or (B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  (15 U.S.C. 7215(c)(4)(A) or (B)); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is subject to an order of suspension or denial of the  privilege of appearing or practicing before the Securities and Exchange  Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon written request, the FDIC, for good cause shown, may grant  written permission to an independent public accountant or accounting  firm to perform audit services for State savings associations.

The  independent public accountant or accounting firm shall bear the burden  of going forward with an application and the burden of proving the  grounds supporting the application. The FDIC may, in its sole  discretion, direct that any reinstatement proceeding be limited to  written submissions.
