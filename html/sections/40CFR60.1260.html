                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required,  obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur  dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide are in parts per million  by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide  level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from  your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual  oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent  oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a  valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your  continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of  operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating  hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter.  An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste  or refuse-derived fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a)  through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection  requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must  notify the Administrator according to Sec. 60.1410(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a)  through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the  continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission  concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 60.1265.</p>
