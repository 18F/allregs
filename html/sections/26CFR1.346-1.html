                                Sec. 1.346-1  Partial liquidation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section defines a partial liquidation. If amounts are distributed in partial liquidation such amounts are treated under section 331(a)(2) as received in part or full payment in exchange for the stock. A distribution is treated as in partial liquidation of a corporation if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The distribution is one of a series of distributions in redemption of all of the stock of the corporation pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The distribution:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is not essentially equivalent to a dividend,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is in redemption of a part of the stock of the corporation pursuant to a plan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Occurs within the taxable year in which the plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year.
An example of a distribution which will qualify as a partial liquidation under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and section 346(a) is a distribution resulting from a genuine contraction of the corporate business such as the distribution of unused insurance proceeds recovered as a result of a fire which destroyed part of the business causing a cessation of a part of its activities. On the other hand, the distribution of funds attributable to a reserve for an expansion program which has been abandoned does not qualify as a partial liquidation within the meaning of section 346(a). A distribution to which section 355 applies (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) is not a distribution in partial liquidation within the meaning of section 346(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special requirements on termination of business. A distribution which occurs within the taxable year in which the

plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year and which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of section 346 falls within paragraph (a)(2) of this section and within section 346(a)(2). The requirements which a distribution must meet to fall within subsection (b) of section 346 are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such distribution is attributable to the corporation's ceasing to conduct, or consists of assets of, a trade or business which has been actively conducted throughout the five-year period immediately before the distribution, which trade or business was not acquired by the corporation within such period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Immediately after such distribution by the corporation it is actively engaged in the conduct of a trade or business, which trade or business was actively conducted throughout the five-year period ending on the date of such distribution and was not acquired by the corporation within such period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part.
A distribution shall be treated as having been made in partial liquidation pursuant to section 346(b) if it consists of the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a trade or business which has been actively conducted for the five-year period and has been terminated, or if it is a distribution in kind of the assets of such a business, or if it is a distribution in kind of some of the assets of such a business and of the proceeds of the sale of the remainder of the assets of such a business. In general, a distribution which will qualify under section 346(b) may consist of, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assets (other than inventory or property described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) used in the trade or business throughout the five-year period immediately before the distribution (for this purpose an asset shall be considered used in the trade or business during the period of time the asset which it replaced was so used), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proceeds from the sale of assets described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and, in addition,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The inventory of such trade or business or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The items constituting such inventory or such property were substantially similar to the items constituting such inventory or property during the five-year period immediately before the distribution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The quantity of such items on the date of distribution was not substantially in excess of the quantity of similar items regularly on hand in the conduct of such business during such five-year period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Proceeds from the sale of inventory or property described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, if such inventory or property is sold in bulk in the course of termination of such trade or business and if with respect to such inventory the conditions of subdivision (iii)(a) and (b) of this subparagraph would have been met had such inventory or property been distributed on the date of such sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Active conduct of a trade or business. For the purpose of section 346(b)(1), a corporation shall be deemed to have actively conducted a trade or business immediately before the distribution, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a business the assets of which have been distributed in kind, the business was operated by such corporation until the date of distribution, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a business the proceeds of the sale of the assets of which are distributed, such business was actively conducted until the date of sale and the proceeds of such sale were distributed as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.
The term active conduct of a trade or business shall have the same meaning in this section as in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.355-1.</p>
