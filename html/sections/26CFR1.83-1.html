                                Sec. 1.83-1  Property transferred in connection with the performance

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inclusion in gross income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Section 83 provides  rules for the taxation of property transferred to an employee or  independent contractor (or beneficiary thereof) in connection with the  performance of services by such employee or independent contractor. In  general, such property is not taxable under section 83(a) until it has  been transferred (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(a)) to such person and  become substantially vested (as defined in Sec. 1.83-3(b)) in such  person. In that case, the excess of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i))</em> at the  time that the property becomes substantially vested, over</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount (if any) paid for such property,  shall be included as compensation in the gross income of such employee  or independent contractor for the taxable year in which the property  becomes substantially vested. Until such property becomes substantially  vested, the transferor shall be regarded as the owner of such property,  and any income from such property received by the employee or  independent contractor (or beneficiary thereof) or the right to the use  of such property by the employee or independent contractor constitutes  additional compensation and shall be included in the gross income of  such employee or independent contractor for the taxable year in which  such income is received or such use is made available. This paragraph  applies to a transfer of property in connection with the performance of  services even though the transferor is not the person for whom such  services are performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>, see Sec. 1.61-22.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cross references. For rules concerning the treatment of  employers and other transferors of property in connection with the  performance of services, see section 83(h) and Sec. 1.83-6. For rules  concerning the taxation of beneficiaries of an employees' trust that is  not exempt under section 501(a), see section 402(b) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsequent sale, forfeiture, or other disposition of nonvested  property. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If substantially nonvested property (that has been  transferred in connection with the performance of services) is  subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of to a third party in an arm's  length transaction while still substantially nonvested, the person who  performed such services shall realize compensation in an amount equal to  the excess of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount realized on such sale or other disposition, over</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount (if any) paid for such property.  Such amount of compensation is includible in his gross income in  accordance with his method of accounting. Two preceding sentences also  apply when the person disposing of the property has received it in a  non-arm's length transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section.  In addition, section 83(a) and paragraph (a) of this section shall  thereafter cease to apply with respect to such property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> does not apply to property to which  Sec. 1.83-2(a) applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph (b) shall not apply to, and no gain shall be  recognized on, any sale, forfeiture, or other disposition described in  this paragraph to the extent that any property received in exchange  therefor is substantially nonvested. Instead, section 83 and this  section shall apply with respect to such property received (as if it  were substituted for the property disposed of).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> shall thereafter be treated as  an amount paid for such property. For example, if in 1971 an employee  pays $50 for a share of stock which has a fair market value of $100 and  is substantially monvested at that time and later in 1971 (at a time  when the property still has a fair market value of $100 and is still  substantially nonvested) the employee disposes of, in a transaction not  at arm's length, the share of stock to his wife for $10, the employee  realizes compensation of $10 in 1971. If in 1972, when the share of  stock has a fair market value of $120, it becomes substantially vested,  the employee realizes additional compensation in 1972 in the amount of  $60 (the $120 fair market value of the stock less both the $50 price  paid for the stock and the $10 taxed as compensation in 1971). For  purposes of this paragraph, if substantially nonvested property has been  transferred to a person other than the person who performed the  services, and the transferee dies holding the property while the  property is still substantially nonvested and while the person who  performed the services is alive, the transfer which results by reason of  the death of such transferee is a transfer not at arm's length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain transfers upon death. If substantially nonvested  property has been transferred in connection with the performance of  services and the person who performed such services dies while the  property is still substantially nonvested, any income realized on or  after such death with respect to such property under this section is  income in respect of a decedent to which the rules of section 691 apply.  In such a case the income in respect of such property shall be taxable  under section 691 (except to the extent not includible under section  101(b)) to the estate or beneficiary of the person who performed the  services, in accordance with section 83 and the regulations thereunder.  However, if an item of income is realized upon such death before July  21, 1978, because the property became substantially vested upon death,  the person responsible for filing decedent's income tax return for  decedent's last taxable year may elect to treat such item as includible  in gross income for decedent's last taxable year by including such item  in gross income on the return or amended return filed for decedent's  last taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Forfeiture after substantial vesting. If a person is taxable  under section 83(a) when the property transferred becomes substantially  vested and thereafter the person's beneficial interest in such property  is nevertheless forfeited pursuant to a lapse restriction, any loss  incurred by such person (but not by a beneficiary of such person) upon  such forfeiture shall be an ordinary loss to the extent the basis in  such   property has been increased as a result of the recognition of income by  such person under section 83(a) with respect to such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. On November 1, 1978, X corporation sells to E, an  employee, 100 shares of X corporation stock at $10 per share. At the  time of such sale the fair market value of the X corporation stock is  $100 per share. Under the terms of the sale each share of stock is  subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture which will not lapse until  November 1, 1988. Evidence of this restriction is stamped on the face of  E's stock certificates, which are therefore nontransferable (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(d)). Since in 1978 E's stock is substantially  nonvested, E does not include any of such amount in his gross income as  compensation in 1978. On November 1, 1988, the fair market value of the  X corporation stock is $250 per share. Since the X corporation stock  becomes substantially vested in 1988, E must include $24,000 (100 shares  of X corporation stock x $250 fair market value per share less $10 price  paid by E for each share) as compensation for 1988. Dividends paid by X  to E on E's stock after it was transferred to E on November 1, 1973, are  taxable to E as additional compensation during the period E's stock is  substantially nonvested and are deductible as such by X.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except  that on November 1, 1985, each share of stock of X corporation in E's  hands could as a matter of law be transferred to a bona fide purchaser  who would not be required to forfeit the stock if the risk of forfeiture  materialized. In the event, however, that the risk materializes, E would  be liable in damages to X. On November 1, 1985, the fair market value of  the X corporation stock is $230 per share. Since E's stock is  transferable within the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(d) in 1985, the stock is  substantially vested and E must include $22,000 (100 shares of X  corporation stock x $230 fair market value per share less $10 price paid  by E for each share) as compensation for 1985.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1) except  that, in 1984 E sells his 100 shares of X corporation stock in an arm's  length sale to I, an investment company, for $120 per share. At the time  of this sale each share of X corporation's stock has a fair market value  of $200. Under paragraph (b) of this section, E must include $11,000  (100 shares of X corporation stock x $120 amount realized per share less  $10 price paid by E per share) as compensation for 1984 notwithstanding  that the stock remains nontransferable and is still subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture at the time of such sale. Under Sec.  1.83-4(b)(2), I's basis in the X corporation stock is $120 per share.  [T.D. 7554, 43 FR 31913, July 24, 1978, as amended by T.D. 9092, 68 FR  54351, Sept. 17, 2003]</p>
