conducting any separate permitting and environmental reviews of the proposed facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every applicant shall file all pertinent data and information necessary for a full and complete understanding of the proposed project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Every requirement of this part will be considered as an obligation of the applicant which can only be avoided by a definite and positive showing that the information or data called for by the applicable rules is not necessary for the consideration and ultimate determination of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The burden of assuring that all applications and information submitted under this part is in an intelligible form and any omission of data is justified rests with the applicant.</p>
