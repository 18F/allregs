Examples of situations that may be prohibited or represent a potential COI include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial interest, including stocks and bonds, in a firm that submits, or is expected to submit, an offer in response to the solicitation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outstanding financial commitments to any actual or potential offeror;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employment in any capacity, even if otherwise permissible, by any actual or potential offeror;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employment within the last 12 months by an actual or potential offeror;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any non-vested pension or re-employment rights, or interest in profit sharing or stock bonus plans arising out of past employment by an actual or potential offeror; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Employment of any member of the immediate family by an actual or potential offeror.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bureaus shall include a notice similar to the following in all correspondence notifying employees of appointments to serve as technical evaluators or advisors, formally called Technical Evaluation Panels (TEP) and/or Source Evaluation Boards (SEB):</p><p class="depth2">You shall not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor involved in any action for which you participate personally and substantially under this delegation of authority. You are also reminded of other conduct prohibitions in FAR 3.104-3, including negotiating with competing contractors for future employment, disclosure of contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information, and post-Government employment restrictions.</p><p class="depth2">Such notice shall include an acknowledgement of receipt signed and returned by the employee.</p>
