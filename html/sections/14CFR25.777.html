Controls of a variable nature using a rotary motion must move clockwise from the off position, through an increasing range, to the full on position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The controls must be located and arranged, with respect to the pilots' seats, so that there is full and unrestricted movement of each control without interference from the cockpit structure or the clothing of the minimum flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523) when any member of this flight crew, from 5[foot]2 to 6[foot]3 in height, is seated with the seat belt and shoulder harness (if provided) fastened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identical powerplant controls for each engine must be located to prevent confusion as to the engines they control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wing flap controls and other auxiliary lift device controls must be located on top of the pedestal, aft of the throttles, centrally or to the right of the pedestal centerline, and not less than 10 inches aft of the landing gear control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The landing gear control must be located forward of the throttles and must be operable by each pilot when seated with seat belt and shoulder harness (if provided) fastened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Control knobs must be shaped in accordance with Sec. 25.781. In addition, the knobs must be of the same color, and this color must contrast with the color of control knobs for other purposes and the surrounding cockpit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a flight engineer is required as part of the minimum flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523), the airplane must have a flight engineer station located and arranged so that the flight crewmembers can perform their functions efficiently and without interfering with each other.
