                            <p class="depth0">A swap execution facility shall establish and enforce trading, trade  processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and it shall  have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Abusive trading practices prohibited. A swap execution facility  shall prohibit abusive trading practices on its markets by members and  market participants. Swap execution facilities that permit  intermediation shall prohibit customer-related abuses including, but not  limited to, trading ahead of customer orders, trading against customer  orders, accommodation trading, and improper cross trading. Specific  trading practices that shall be prohibited include front-running, wash  trading, pre-arranged trading (except for block trades permitted by part  43 of this chapter or other types of transactions certified to or  approved by the Commission pursuant to the procedures under part 40 of  this chapter), fraudulent trading, money passes, and any other trading  practices that a swap execution facility deems to be abusive. A swap  execution facility shall also prohibit any other manipulative or  disruptive trading practices prohibited by the Act or by the Commission  pursuant to Commission regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Capacity to detect and investigate rule violations. A swap  execution facility shall have arrangements and resources for effective  enforcement of its rules. Such arrangements shall include the authority  to collect information and documents on both a routine and non-routine  basis, including the authority to examine books and records kept by the  swap execution facility's members and by persons under investigation. A  swap execution facility's arrangements and resources shall also  facilitate the direct supervision of the market and the analysis of data  collected to determine whether a rule violation has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance staff and resources. A swap execution facility shall  establish and maintain sufficient compliance staff and resources to  ensure that it can conduct effective audit trail reviews, trade practice  surveillance, market surveillance, and real-time market   monitoring. The swap execution facility's compliance staff shall also be  sufficient to address unusual market or trading events as they arise,  and to conduct and complete investigations in a timely manner, as set  forth in Sec. 37.203(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Automated trade surveillance system. A swap execution facility  shall maintain an automated trade surveillance system capable of  detecting potential trade practice violations. The automated trade  surveillance system shall load and process daily orders and trades no  later than 24 hours after the completion of the trading day. The  automated trade surveillance system shall have the capability to detect  and flag specific trade execution patterns and trade anomalies; compute,  retain, and compare trading statistics; compute trade gains, losses, and  swap-equivalent positions; reconstruct the sequence of market activity;  perform market analyses; and support system users to perform in-depth  analyses and ad hoc queries of trade-related data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Real-time market monitoring. A swap execution facility shall  conduct real-time market monitoring of all trading activity on its  system(s) or platform(s) to identify disorderly trading and any market  or system anomalies. A swap execution facility shall have the authority  to adjust trade prices or cancel trades when necessary to mitigate  market disrupting events caused by malfunctions in its system(s) or  platform(s) or errors in orders submitted by members and market  participants. Any trade price adjustments or trade cancellations shall  be transparent to the market and subject to standards that are clear,  fair, and publicly available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Investigations and investigation reports--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures. A swap  execution facility shall establish and maintain procedures that require  its compliance staff to conduct investigations of possible rule  violations. An investigation shall be commenced upon the receipt of a  request from Commission staff or upon the discovery or receipt of  information by the swap execution facility that indicates a reasonable  basis for finding that a violation may have occurred or will occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timeliness. Each compliance staff investigation shall be  completed in a timely manner. Absent mitigating factors, a timely manner  is no later than 12 months after the date that an investigation is  opened. Mitigating factors that may reasonably justify an investigation  taking longer than 12 months to complete include the complexity of the  investigation, the number of firms or individuals involved as potential  wrongdoers, the number of potential violations to be investigated, and  the volume of documents and data to be examined and analyzed by  compliance staff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Investigation reports when a reasonable basis exists for finding  a violation. Compliance staff shall submit a written investigation  report for disciplinary action in every instance in which compliance  staff determines from surveillance or from an investigation that a  reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation. The investigation  report shall include the reason the investigation was initiated; a  summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant facts; compliance staff's  analysis and conclusions; and a recommendation as to whether  disciplinary action should be pursued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Investigation reports when no reasonable basis exists for  finding a violation. If after conducting an investigation, compliance  staff determines that no reasonable basis exists for finding a rule  violation, it shall prepare a written report including the reason the  investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the  relevant facts; and compliance staff's analysis and conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Warning letters. No more than one warning letter may be issued  to the same person or entity found to have committed the same rule  violation within a rolling twelve month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional sources for compliance. A swap execution facility may  refer to the guidance and/or acceptable practices in appendix B of this  part to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the requirements  of Sec. 37.203.</p>
