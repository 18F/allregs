                            <p class="depth0">A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade  assigned under Sec. 868.210. Such special grades for rough rice are  established and determined as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Infested rough rice. Tolerances for live insects for infested  rough rice are defined according to sampling designations as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the  work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. The  rough rice (except when examined according to paragraph (a)(3) of this  section will be considered infested if the representative sample  contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more  other live insects injurious to stored rice or five or more other live  insects injurious to stored rice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered  infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or  more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more other  live insects injurious to stored rice, or 15 or more live Angoumois  moths or other live moths injurious to stored rice are found in, on, or  about the lot.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sample as a whole during continuous loading/unloading. The  minimum sample size for rice being sampled during continuous loading/ unloading is 500 grams per each 100,000 pounds of rice. The sample as a  whole is considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS  instructions) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and  one or more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more  other live insects injurious to stored rice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parboiled rough rice. Parboiled rough rice shall be rough rice  in which the starch has been gelatinized by soaking, steaming, and  drying. Grades U.S. No. 1 to U.S. No. 6 inclusive, shall contain not  more than 10.0 percent of ungelatinized kernels. Grades U.S. No. 1 and  U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 0.1 percent, grades U.S. No. 3  and U.S. No. 4 not more than 0.2 percent, and grades U.S. No. 5 and U.S.  No. 6 not more than 0.5 percent of nonparboiled rice. If the rice is:  (1) Not distinctly colored by the parboiling process, it shall be  considered ``Parboiled Light''; (2) distinctly but not materially  colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered ``Parboiled'';  (3) materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered  ``Parboiled Dark.'' The color levels for ``Parboiled Light,''  ``Parboiled,'' and ``Parboiled Dark'' rice shall be in accordance with  the interpretive line samples for parboiled rice.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' ``Heat-damaged  kernels,'' ``Kernels damaged by heat,'' and the ``Color requirements''  shown in Sec. 868.210 are not applicable to the special grade  ``Parboiled rough rice.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Smutty rough rice. Smutty rough rice shall be rough rice which  contains more than 3.0 percent of smutty kernels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Glutinous rough rice. Glutinous rough rice shall be special  varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. glutinosa) which contain more than 50  percent chalky kernels. Grade U.S. No. 1 shall contain not more than 1.0  percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 2.0 percent  of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 4.0 percent of  nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 6.0 percent of  nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent of  nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 6 not more than 15.0 percent of  nonchalky kernels.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels'' in Sec. 868.210 are  not applicable to the special grade ``Glutinous rough rice.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Aromatic rough rice. Aromatic rough rice shall be special  varieties of   rice (Oryza sativa L. scented) that have a distinctive and  characteristic aroma; e.g., basmati and jasmine rice.
