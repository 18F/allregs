                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Declaration on incidental arrival. A resident who enters the  United States merely as an incident of foreign travel and who will  continue his foreign travel before finally returning to the United  States from a continuous trip must declare, but need not clear through  CBP, any articles he has acquired or had repaired or altered while  abroad. The incidental character of the arrival must be made known to  the CBP officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of articles on incidental arrival. In order that a  resident may claim the $800 or $1,600 exemption upon his final arrival  in the United States   from a continuous trip, articles accompanying him at the time of an  incidental arrival may be exported directly from CBP custody or after  transportation in bond, or the articles may be left in CBP custody if  the resident upon his final return is to arrive at the CBP facility  where the articles are deposited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to advise of incidental character of arrival. If the  traveler fails to advise the CBP officer of the incidental character of  his arrival, or for other reason declares any articles for allowance of  the $800 or $1,600 exemption, such declaration will mark the beginning  of the respective period or periods during which a further exemption  cannot be granted.
