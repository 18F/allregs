                                Sec. 1.513-6  Certain hospital services not unrelated trade or business.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 513(e), the furnishing of a service  listed in section 501(e)(1)(A) by a hospital to one or more other  hospitals will not constitute unrelated trade or business if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The service is provided solely to hospitals that have facilities  to serve not more than 100 inpatients,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The service would, if performed by the recipient hospital,  constitute an activity consistent with that hospital's exempt purposes,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The service is provided at a fee not in excess of actual cost,  including straight line depreciation and a reasonable rate of return on  the capital goods used to provide the service. For purposes of this  section, a rate of return on capital goods will be considered reasonable  provided that it does not exceed, on an annual basis, the percentage  described below which is based on the average of the rates of interest  on special issues of public debt obligations issued to the Federal  Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for each of the months included in the  taxable year of the hospital duringwhich the captial goods are used in  providing the service. Determinations as to the cost of services and the  applicable rate of return should be made as prescribed by 42 U.S.C.  1395x(v)(1) (A) and (B) and the regulations thereunder (permitting a  health care facility to be reimbursed under the Medicare program for the  reasonable cost of (its) services, including, in the case of certain  proprietary facilities, a reasonable return on equity capital). For  taxable years beginning on or before May 14, 1986, the rate of return  shall be one and one-half times the average of the rates of interest on  public debt obligations described above which were in effect on or  before April 20, 1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(A)(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A large metropolitan hospital provides various services to  other hospitals. The hospital furnishes a purchasing service to  hosptials N and O, a data processing service to hospitals R and S, and a  food service to hospitals X and Y. All the hospitals are described in  section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii). All the hospitals have facilities to serve  not more than 100 inpatients except hospital N. The services are  furnished at cost to all hospitals except that hospital R is charged a  fee in excess of cost for its use of the data processing service. The  purchasing service constitutes unrelated trade or business because it is  not provided solely to hospitals having facilities to serve not more  than 100 inpatients.</p><p class="depth2">The data processing service constitutes unrelated trade or business  because it is provided at a fee in excess of cost. The food service  satisfies all three requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and  does not constitute unrelated trade or business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. Section 513(e) and this section apply to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1953.  [T.D. 8075, 51 FR 5322, Feb. 13, 1986; 51 FR 8490, Mar. 12, 1986]</p>
