The reporting week shall be the seven day period starting at midnight following the close of business on each Saturday and ending at midnight after close of business of the following Saturday. Before close of business of the first business day of the following week, the warehouse operator will provide following information to CCC:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bales made available for shipment (BMAS) during such week. BMAS is defined as any cotton bales that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have been delivered, or are scheduled and ready for delivery during such week; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were scheduled and ready for delivery in a previous week, but were not picked up by the shipper and remain available for immediate loading and another shipping date has not been established, or such bales are not subject to a restocking fee as provided in the warehouse operator's public tariff. Bales that have been available for delivery but not picked up may be counted as BMAS for no longer than the first two weeks that such bales have been made available for delivery but not yet picked up by the shipper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Active shipping orders, by week; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicable storage capacity that is the higher of CCC approved capacity or the maximum number of bales stored at any time during the applicable crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The warehouse operator may resolve any claim for noncompliance from any entity other than CCC with the cotton shipping standard in a court of competent jurisdiction or through mutually agreed upon arbitration procedures. In no case will CCC provide assistance or representation to parties involved in arbitration proceedings arising with respect to activities authorized under the Cotton Storage Agreement.
