                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following guidelines shall apply to the sanctioning of  disciplinary infractions or new criminal conduct committed by a prisoner  during any period of confinement that is credited to his current  sentence (whether before or after sentence is imposed), but prior to his  release on parole; and by a parole violator during any period of  confinement prior to or following the revocation of his parole (except  when such period of confinement has resulted from initial parole to a  detainer). These guidelines specify the customary time to be served for  such behavior which shall be added to the time required by the original  presumptive or effective date. Credit shall be given towards service of  these guidelines for any time spent in custody on a new offense that has  not been credited towards service of the original presumptive or  effective date. If a new concurrent or consecutive sentence is imposed  for such behavior, these guidelines shall also be applied at the initial  hearing on such term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Administrative rule infraction(s) (including alcohol abuse)  normally can be adequately sanctioned by postponing a presumptive or  effective date by 0-60 days per instance of misconduct, or by 0-8 months  in the case of use or simple possession of illicit drugs or refusal to  provide a urine sample. Escape or other new criminal conduct shall be  considered in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section  shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or  effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Escape or attempted escape--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Escape or attempted escape,  except as listed below--8-16 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If from non-secure custody with voluntary return in 6 days or  less--<=6 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If by fear or force applied to person(s), grade under (ii) but  not less than Category Five.</p><p class="depth0">Notes: (1) If other criminal conduct is committed during the escape  or during time spent in escape status, then time to be served for the  escape/attempted escape shall be added to that assessed for the other  new criminal conduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time in escape status shall not be credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Voluntary return is defined as returning voluntarily to the  facility or voluntarily turning one's self in to a law enforcement  authority as an escapee (not in connection with an arrest on other  charges).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-secure custody refers to custody with no significant  physical restraint [e.g., walkaway from a work detail outside the  security perimeter of an institution; failure to return to any  institution from a pass or unescorted furlough; or escape by stealth  from an institution with no physical perimeter barrier (usually a camp  or community corrections center)].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other new criminal behavior in a prison facility.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Severity rating in the new criminal</p><p class="depth0">behavior (from Sec.   2.20)                Guideline range ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Category One.............................  <<=8 months. Category Two.............................  <<=10 months. Category Three...........................  12-16 months. Category Four............................  20-26 months. Category Five............................  36-48 months. Category Six.............................  52-64 months. Category Seven...........................  64-92 months. Category Eight...........................  120+ months. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Note: Grade unlawful possession of a firearm or explosives in a  prison facility, other than a community corrections center, as Category  Six. Grade unlawful possession of a firearm in a community corrections  center as Category Four. Grade unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon  other than a firearm or explosives (e.g., a knife) in a prison facility  or community corrections center as Category Three.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> New criminal behavior in the community (e.g., while on pass,  furlough, work release, or on escape). In such cases, the guidelines  applicable to reparole violators under Sec.  2.21 shall be applied,  using the new offense severity (from Sec.  2.20) and recalculated  salient factor score (such score shall be recalculated as if the  prisoner had been on parole at the time of the new criminal behavior).  The time required pursuant to these guidelines shall be added to the  time required by the original presumptive or effective date.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Offenses committed in a prison or in a community corrections  center that are not limited to the confines of the prison or community  corrections center (e.g., mail fraud of a victim outside the prison) are  graded as new criminal behavior in the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The above are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances  warrant, a decision outside the guidelines (above or below) may be  rendered provided specific reasons are given. For example, a substantial  period of good conduct since the last disciplinary infraction in cases  not involving new criminal conduct may be treated as a mitigating  circumstance.
