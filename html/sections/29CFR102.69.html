                                Sec. 102.69  Election procedure; tally of ballots; objections;  on objections and challenges; exceptions to hearing officer reports;  regional director decisions on objections and challenges.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election procedure; tally; objections. Unless otherwise directed  by the Board, all elections shall be conducted under the supervision of  the regional director in whose Region the proceeding is pending. All  elections shall be by secret ballot. Whenever two or more labor  organizations are included as choices in an election, either participant  may, upon its prompt request to and approval thereof by the regional  director, whose decision shall be final, have its name removed from the  ballot, except that in a proceeding involving an employer-filed petition  or a petition for decertification, the labor organization certified,  currently recognized, or found to be seeking recognition may not have  its name removed from the ballot without giving timely notice in writing  to all parties and the regional director, disclaiming any representation  interest among the employees in the unit. A pre-election conference may  be held at which the parties may check the list of voters and attempt to   resolve any questions of eligibility or inclusions in the unit. When the  election is conducted manually, any party may be represented by  observers of its own selection, subject to such limitations as the  regional director may prescribe. Any party and Board agents may  challenge, for good cause, the eligibility of any person to participate  in the election. The ballots of such challenged persons shall be  impounded. Upon the conclusion of the election the ballots will be  counted and a tally of ballots prepared and immediately made available  to the parties. Within 7 days after the tally of ballots has been  prepared, any party may file with the regional director an original and  five copies of objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct  affecting the results of the election which shall contain a short  statement of the reasons therefor and a written offer of proof in the  form described in Sec. 102.66(c) insofar as applicable, except that the  regional director may extend the time for filing the written offer of  proof in support of the election objections upon request of a party  showing good cause. Such filing(s) must be timely whether or not the  challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the  election. The party filing the objections shall serve a copy of the  objections, including the short statement of reasons therefor, but not  the written offer of proof, on each of the other parties to the case,  and include a certificate of such service with the objections. A person  filing objections by facsimile pursuant to Sec. 102.114(f) shall also  file an original for the Agency's records, but failure to do so shall  not affect the validity of the filing if otherwise proper. In addition,  extra copies need not be filed if the filing is by facsimile or  electronically pursuant to Sec. 102.114(f) or (i). The regional  director will transmit a copy of the objections to each of the other  parties to the proceeding, but shall not transmit the offer of proof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification in the absence of objections, determinative  challenges and runoff elections. If no objections are filed within the  time set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, if the challenged  ballots are insufficient in number to affect the results of the  election, and if no runoff election is to be held pursuant to Sec.  102.70, the regional director shall forthwith issue to the parties a  certification of the results of the election, including certification of  representative where appropriate with the same force and effect as if  issued by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Decisions resolving objections and challenges without a  hearing. If timely objections are filed to the conduct of an election or  to conduct affecting the results of the election, and the regional  director determines that the evidence described in the accompanying  offer of proof would not constitute grounds for setting aside the  election if introduced at a hearing, and the regional director  determines that any determinative challenges do not raise substantial  and material factual issues, the regional director shall issue a  decision disposing of the objections and determinative challenges, and a  certification of the results of the election, including certification of  representative where appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notices of hearing on objections and challenges. If timely  objections are filed to the conduct of the election or to conduct  affecting the results of the election, and the regional director  determines that the evidence described in the accompanying offer of  proof could be grounds for setting aside the election if introduced at a  hearing, or if the challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect  the results of the election and raise substantial and material factual  issues, the regional director shall transmit to the parties and their  designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if  neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided) a notice of  hearing before a hearing officer at a place and time fixed therein. The  regional director shall set the hearing for a date 21 days after the  preparation of the tally of ballots or as soon as practicable  thereafter, unless the parties agree to an earlier date, except that the  regional director may consolidate the hearing concerning objections and  challenges with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an  administrative law judge. In any proceeding wherein the election has  been held pursuant to Sec. 102.62(a) or (c) and the representation case  has been consolidated   with an unfair labor practice proceeding for purposes of hearing, the  administrative law judge shall, after issuing a decision, sever the  representation case and transfer it to the regional director for further  processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Hearings; hearing officer reports; exceptions to regional  director. The hearing on objections and challenges shall continue from  day to day until completed unless the regional director concludes that  extraordinary circumstances warrant otherwise. Any hearing pursuant to  this section shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 102.64, 102.65, and 102.66, insofar as applicable. Any party  shall have the right to appear at the hearing in person, by counsel, or  by other representative, to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses,  and to introduce into the record evidence of the significant facts that  support the party's contentions and are relevant to the objections and  determinative challenges that are the subject of the hearing. The  hearing officer may rule on offers of proof. Post-hearing briefs shall  be filed only upon special permission of the hearing officer and within  the time and addressing the subjects permitted by the hearing officer.  Upon the close of such hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare and  cause to be served on the parties a report resolving questions of  credibility and containing findings of fact and recommendations as to  the disposition of the issues. Any party may, within 14 days from the  date of issuance of such report, file with the regional director an  original and one copy of exceptions to such report, with supporting  brief if desired. A copy of such exceptions, together with a copy of any  brief filed, shall immediately be served on the other parties and a  statement of service filed with the regional director. Within 7 days  from the last date on which exceptions and any supporting brief may be  filed, or such further time as the regional director may allow, a party  opposing the exceptions may file an answering brief with the regional  director. An original and one copy shall be submitted. A copy of such  answering brief shall immediately be served on the other parties and a  statement of service filed with the regional director. Extra copies of  electronically-filed papers need not be filed. The regional director  shall thereupon decide the matter upon the record or make other  disposition of the case. If no exceptions are filed to such report, the  regional director, upon the expiration of the period for filing such  exceptions, may decide the matter forthwith upon the record or may make  other disposition of the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regional director decisions and Board review. The decision of  the regional director may include a certification of the results of the  election, including certification of representative where appropriate,  and shall be final unless a request for review is granted. If a consent  election has been held pursuant to Sec. Sec. 102.62(a) or (c), the  decision of the regional director is not subject to Board review. If the  election has been conducted pursuant to Sec. 102.62(b), or by a  direction of election issued following any proceeding under Sec.  102.67, the parties shall have the right to Board review set forth in  Sec. 102.67, except that in any proceeding wherein a representation  case has been consolidated with an unfair labor practice proceeding for  purposes of hearing and the election was conducted pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 102.62(b) or 102.67, the provisions of Sec. 102.46 shall  govern with respect to the filing of exceptions or an answering brief to  the exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision, and a request  for review of the regional director's decision and direction of election  shall be due at the same time as the exceptions to the administrative  law judge's decision are due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Record in case with hearing. In a proceeding pursuant to  this section in which a hearing is held, the record in the case shall  consist of the notice of hearing, motions, rulings, orders, stenographic  report of the hearing, stipulations, exhibits, together with the  objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the  results of the election, offers of proof made at the post-election  hearing, any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties,  any report on such objections and/or on challenged ballots, exceptions,  the decision of the regional director, any requests for review, and the  record previously made as defined in Sec. 102.68. Materials other   than those set out above shall not be a part of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Record in case with no hearing. In a proceeding pursuant to  this section in which no hearing is held, the record shall consist of  the objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting  the results of the election, any decision on objections or on challenged  ballots and any request for review of such a decision, any documentary  evidence, excluding statements of witnesses, relied upon by the regional  director in his decision, any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted  by the parties, and any other motions, rulings or orders of the regional  director. Materials other than those set out above shall not be a part  of the record, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediately upon issuance of an order granting a request for  review by the Board, the regional director shall transmit to the Board  the record of the proceeding as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a proceeding pursuant to this section in which no hearing is  held, a party filing a request for review of a regional director's  decision on challenged ballots or on objections or on both, or any  opposition thereto, may support its submission to the Board by appending  thereto copies of any offer of proof, including copies of any affidavits  or other documentary evidence, it has timely submitted to the regional  director and which were not included in the decision. Documentary  evidence so appended shall thereupon become part of the record in the  proceeding. Failure to append that evidence to its submission to the  Board in the representation proceeding as provided above, shall preclude  a party from relying on such evidence in any subsequent unfair labor  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Revised tally of ballots. In any case under this section in  which the regional director or the Board, upon a ruling on challenged  ballots, has directed that such ballots be opened and counted and a  revised tally of ballots issued, and no objection to such revised tally  is filed by any party within 7 days after the revised tally of ballots  has been made available, the regional director shall forthwith issue to  the parties certification of the results of the election, including  certifications of representative where appropriate with the same force  and effect as if issued by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Format of filings with regional director. All documents filed  with the regional director under the provisions of this section shall be  filed double spaced, on 8\1/2\- by 11-inch paper, and shall be printed  or otherwise legibly duplicated. Extra copies of electronically-filed  papers need not be filed. Briefs in support of exceptions or answering  briefs shall not exceed 50 pages in length, exclusive of subject index  and table of cases and other authorities cited, unless permission to  exceed that limit is obtained from the regional director by motion,  setting forth the reasons therefor, filed not less than 5 days,  including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, prior to the date the brief  is due. Where any brief filed pursuant to this section exceeds 20 pages,  it shall contain a subject index with page references and an  alphabetical table of cases and other authorities cited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Extensions of time. Requests for extensions of time to file  exceptions, requests for review, supporting briefs, or answering briefs,  as permitted by this section, shall be filed with the Board or the  regional director, as the case may be. The party filing the request for  an extension of time shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties  and, if filed with the Board, on the regional director. A statement of  such service shall be filed with the document.  [79 FR 74486, Dec. 15, 2014]</p>
