Funds for the HPG program will be available for a limited period each fiscal year. Due to the requirements by law to allocate funds on a formula basis to all States and to have a competitive selection process for HPG project selection, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will announce opening and closing dates for receipt of HPG applications. After the closing date, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will review and evaluate the proposals, adjust State allocations as necessary to comply with the law and program demand, and redistribute remaining unused HPG resources for use under Section 504 (as required by statute).
