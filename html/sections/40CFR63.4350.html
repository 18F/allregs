Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4351(d)(5), you must conduct a performance test of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in Sec. Sec. 63.4360, 63.4361, and 63.4362, and establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4292, within 180 days of the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.4283.

balance for a solvent recovery system, whichever is later. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to Sec. Sec. 63.4360, 63.4361, and 63.4362; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to Sec. 63.4351(d)(5); calculations according to Sec. 63.4351 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period either the organic HAP overall control efficiency was equal to or greater than the applicable overall control efficiency limit in Table 1 to this subpart or the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration was no greater than 20 parts per million by weight (ppmw) on a dry basis; the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by Sec. 63.4364; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by Sec. 63.4293.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by Sec. 63.4292 until after you have completed the performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
