The chordal displacement at time T is defined as the straight line distance between (1) the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head center of gravity at time zero, and (2) the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head center of gravity at time T as illustrated by Figure 3. The peak resultant acceleration recorded at the location of the accelerometers mounted in the head form in accordance with Sec. 572.11(b) shall not exceed 26g. The pendulum shall not reverse direction until the head's center of gravity returns to the original zero time position relative to the pendulum arm.
