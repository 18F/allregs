                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a  direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a  ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour (i.e., a  combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations)  or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air  transportation that states a price for such air transportation, tour, or  tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49  U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price to be paid by  the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation,  tour, or tour component. Although charges included within the single  total price listed (e.g., government taxes) may be stated separately or  through links or ``pop ups'' on websites that display the total price,  such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed  prominently, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the  total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis  that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department considers any advertising by the entities listed  in paragraph (a) of this section of an each-way airfare that is  available only when purchased for round-trip travel to be an unfair and  deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless such airfare  is advertised as ``each way'' and in such a manner so that the  disclosure of the round-trip purchase requirement is clearly and  conspicuously noted in the advertisement and is stated prominently and  proximately to the each-way fare amount. The Department considers it to  be an unfair and deceptive practice to advertise each-way fares  contingent on a round-trip purchase requirement as ``one-way'' fares,  even if accompanied by prominent and proximate disclosure of the round  trip purchase requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When offering a ticket for purchase by a consumer, for passenger  air transportation or for a tour (i.e., a combination of air  transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component  (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, a  direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a  ticket agent, may not offer additional optional services in connection  with air transportation, a tour, or tour component whereby the optional  service is automatically added to the consumer's purchase if the  consumer takes no other action, i.e., if the consumer does not opt out.  The consumer must affirmatively ``opt in'' (i.e., agree) to such a  service and the fee for it before that fee is added to the total price  for the air transportation-related purchase. The Department considers  the use of ``opt-out'' provisions to be an unfair and deceptive practice  in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712.  [76 FR 23166, Apr. 25, 2011]</p>
