                            <p class="depth0">The Commission will not recognize any certified public accountant or  public accountant through December 31, 1975, who is not in fact  independent. Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, the  Commission will recognize only independent certified public accountants,  or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or  before December 31, 1970, who are in fact independent. For example, an  accountant will not be considered independent with respect to any person  or any of its parents or subsidiaries in whom he has, or had during the  period of report, any direct financial interest. The Commission will  determine the fact of independence by considering all the relevant  circumstances including evidence bearing on the relationships between  the accountant and that person or any affiliate thereof.
