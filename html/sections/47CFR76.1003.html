To the extent that a cable  operator, satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast  programming vendor expressly references and relies upon a document or  documents in asserting a defense or responding to a material allegation,  such document or documents shall be included as part of the answer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An answer to an exclusivity complaint shall provide the  defendant's reasons for refusing to sell the subject programming to the  complainant. In addition, the defendant may submit its programming  contracts covering the area specified in the complaint with its answer  to refute allegations concerning the existence of an impermissible  exclusive contract.

The defendant shall also provide  with its answer written documentary evidence   to support its justification of the magnitude of any price differential  between the complainant and such similarly situated distributor that is  not de minimis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An answer to a complaint alleging an unreasonable refusal to  sell programming shall state the defendant's reasons for refusing to  sell to the complainant, or for refusing to sell to the complainant on  the same terms and conditions as complainant's competitor, and shall  specify why the defendant's actions are not discriminatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reply. Within fifteen (15) days after service of an answer,  unless otherwise directed by the Commission, the complainant may file  and serve a reply which shall be responsive to matters contained in the  answer and shall not contain new matters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Time limit on filing of complaints. Any complaint filed pursuant  to this subsection must be filed within one year of the date on which  one of the following events occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The satellite cable programming vendor, satellite broadcast  programming vendor, or terrestrial cable programming vendor enters into  a contract with the complainant that the complainant alleges to violate  one or more of the rules contained in this subpart; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The satellite cable programming vendor, satellite broadcast  programming vendor, or terrestrial cable programming vendor offers to  sell programming to the complainant pursuant to terms that the  complainant alleges to violate one or more of the rules contained in  this subpart, and such offer to sell programming is unrelated to any  existing contract between the complainant and the satellite cable  programming vendor, satellite broadcast programming vendor, or  terrestrial cable programming vendor; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The complainant has notified a cable operator, or a satellite  cable programming vendor or a satellite broadcast programming vendor  that it intends to file a complaint with the Commission based on a  request to purchase or negotiate to purchase satellite cable  programming, satellite broadcast programming, or terrestrial cable  programming, or has made a request to amend an existing contract  pertaining to such programming pursuant to Sec.  76.1002(f) of this part  that has been denied or unacknowledged, allegedly in violation of one or  more of the rules contained in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Remedies for violations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Remedies authorized. Upon  completion of such adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission shall order  appropriate remedies, including, if necessary, the imposition of  damages, and/or the establishment of prices, terms, and conditions for  the sale of programming to the aggrieved multichannel video programming  distributor. Such order shall set forth a timetable for compliance, and  shall become effective upon release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional sanctions. The remedies provided in paragraph (h)(1)  of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of the sanctions  available under title V or any other provision of the Communications  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Imposition of damages. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bifurcation. In all cases in which  damages are requested, the Commission may bifurcate the program access  violation determination from any damage adjudication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Burden of proof. The burden of proof regarding damages rests  with the complainant, who must demonstrate with specificity the damages  arising from the program access violation. Requests for damages that  grossly overstate the amount of damages may result in a Commission  determination that the complainant failed to satisfy its burden of proof  to demonstrate with specificity the damages arising from the program  access violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Damages adjudication. (A) The Commission may, in its  discretion, end adjudication of damages with a written order determining  the sufficiency of the damages computation submitted in accordance with  paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section or the damages computation  methodology submitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this  section, modifying such computation or methodology, or requiring the  complainant to resubmit such computation or methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the Commission issues a written order approving or  modifying a damages computation submitted in accordance with paragraph  (d)(3)(i) of   this section, the defendant shall recompense the complainant as directed  therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the Commission issues a written order approving or  modifying a damages computation methodology submitted in accordance with  paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, the parties shall negotiate in  good faith to reach an agreement on the exact amount of damages pursuant  to the Commission-mandated methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within thirty days of the issuance of a paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D)  of this section damages methodology order, the parties shall submit  jointly to the Commission either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement detailing the parties' agreement as to the amount of  damages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the parties are continuing to negotiate in good  faith and a request that the parties be given an extension of time to  continue negotiations; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A statement detailing the bases for the continuing dispute and  the reasons why no agreement can be reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issues concerning the amount of damages may be designated by the  Chief, Media Bureau for hearing before, or, if the parties agree,  submitted for mediation to, a Commission Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Interest on the amount of damages awarded will accrue from  either the date indicated in the Commission's written order issued  pursuant to paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A)(1) of this section or the date  agreed upon by the parties as a result of their negotiations pursuant to  paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A)(2) of this section. Interest shall be computed  at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax  refunds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Alternative dispute resolution. Within 20 days of the close of  the pleading cycle, the parties to the program access dispute may  voluntarily engage in alternative dispute resolution, including  commercial arbitration. The Commission will suspend action on the  complaint if both parties agree to use alternative dispute resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Discovery. In addition to the general pleading and discovery  rules contained in Sec.  76.7, parties to a program access complaint may  serve requests for discovery directly on opposing parties, and file a  copy of the request with the Commission. The respondent shall have the  opportunity to object to any request for documents that are not in its  control or relevant to the dispute or protected from disclosure by the  attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or other  recognized protections from disclosure. Such request shall be heard, and  determination made, by the Commission. Until the objection is ruled  upon, the obligation to produce the disputed material is suspended. Any  party who fails to timely provide discovery requested by the opposing  party to which it has not raised an objection as described above, or who  fails to respond to a Commission order for discovery material, may be  deemed in default and an order may be entered in accordance with the  allegations contained in the complaint, or the complaint may be  dismissed with prejudice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Protective orders. In addition to the procedures contained in  Sec.  76.9 of this part related to the protection of confidential  material, the Commission may issue orders to protect the confidentiality  of proprietary information required to be produced for resolution of  program access complaints. A protective order constitutes both an order  of the Commission and an agreement between the party executing the  protective order declaration and the party submitting the protected  material. The Commission has full authority to fashion appropriate  sanctions for violations of its protective orders, including but not  limited to suspension or disbarment of attorneys from practice before  the Commission, forfeitures, cease and desist orders, and denial of  further access to confidential information in Commission proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Petitions for temporary standstill. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A program access  complainant seeking renewal of an existing programming contract may file  a petition along with its complaint requesting a temporary   standstill of the price, terms, and other conditions of the existing  programming contract pending resolution of the complaint. In addition to  the requirements of Sec.  76.7, the complainant shall have the burden of  proof to demonstrate the following in its petition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The complainant is likely to prevail on the merits of its  complaint;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The complainant will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Grant of a stay will not substantially harm other interested  parties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The public interest favors grant of a stay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The defendant cable operator, satellite cable programming vendor  or satellite broadcast programming vendor upon which a petition for  temporary standstill is served shall answer within ten (10) days of  service of the petition, unless otherwise directed by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Commission grants the temporary standstill, the  Commission's decision acting on the complaint will provide for remedies  that make the terms of the new agreement between the parties retroactive  to the expiration date of the previous programming contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Deadline for Media Bureau action on complaints alleging a denial  of programming. For complaints alleging a denial of programming, the  Chief, Media Bureau shall release a decision resolving the complaint  within six (6) months from the date the complaint is filed.
