The notice will include the facts surrounding the determination and the  action the Corporation proposes to take. The notice will also identify  the reviewing official in your case and provide other pertinent  information. You will be allowed to show good cause as to why  forfeiture, revocation, the denial of a benefit, or other action should  not be implemented. You will be given 10 calendar days to submit written  materials in opposition to the proposed action.</p>
