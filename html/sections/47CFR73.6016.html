                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Digital Class A TV stations must protect authorized TV broadcast  stations, applications for minor changes in authorized TV broadcast  stations filed on or before November 29, 1999, and applications for new  TV broadcast stations that had been cut-off without competing  applications or that were the winning bidder in a TV broadcast station  auction as of that date, or that were the proposed remaining applicant  in a group of mutually-exclusive applications for which a settlement  agreement was on file as of that date. This protection must be based on  meeting the requirements of Sec.  74.793 (b)-(d) and (f) of this  chapter. An application for DTV operation of an existing Class A TV  station or to change the facilities of a digital Class A TV station will  not be accepted if it fails to protect these TV broadcast stations and  applications pursuant to these requirements.
