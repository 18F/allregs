Such notification must be  made in writing and include a copy of all information relevant to the  permit application within 30 days of receipt of and at least 60 days  prior to public hearing by the State on the application for permit to  construct. Such notification must include an analysis of the anticipated  impacts on visibility in any Federal Class I area,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the State requires or receives advance notification (e.g.  early consultation with the source prior to submission of the  application or notification of intent to monitor under Sec. 51.166) of  a permit application of a source that may affect visibility the State  must notify all affected Federal Land Managers within 30 days of such  advance notification, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consideration of any analysis performed by the Federal Land  Manager, provided within 30 days of the notification and analysis  required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that such proposed new  major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact  on visibility in any Federal Class I area. Where the State finds that  such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the State  that an adverse impact will result in the Federal Class I area, the  State must, in the notice of public hearing, either explain its decision  or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The plan shall also provide for the review of any new major  stationary source or major modification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That may have an impact on any integral vista of a mandatory  Class I Federal area, if it is identified in accordance with Sec.  51.304 by the Federal Land Manager at least 12 months before submission  of a complete permit application, except where the Federal   Land Manager has provided notice and opportunity for public comment on  the integral vista in which case the review must include impacts on any  integral vista identified at least 6 months prior to submission of a  complete permit application, unless the State determines under Sec.  51.304(d) that the identification was not in accordance with the  identification criteria, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That proposes to locate in an area classified as nonattainment  under section 107(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) of the Clean Air Act that may  have an impact on visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of any major stationary source or major modification  under paragraph (b) of this section, shall be conducted in accordance  with paragraph (a) of this section, and Sec. 51.166(o), (p)(1) through  (2), and (q). In conducting such reviews the State must ensure that the  source's emissions will be consistent with making reasonable progress  toward the national visibility goal referred to in Sec. 51.300(a). The  State may take into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary  for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of  compliance, and the useful life of the source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State may require monitoring of visibility in any Federal  Class I area near the proposed new stationary source or major  modification for such purposes and by such means as the State deems  necessary and appropriate.
