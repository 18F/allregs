                            <p class="depth0">A certificate of conformity is no longer valid for a vehicle if the  vehicle is modified such that it is not in a configuration covered by  the certificate. This section applies if such modifications are done to  convert the vehicle to run on a different fuel type. Such vehicles may  be recertified as specified in this section if the original certificate  is no longer valid for that vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> if the modified vehicle is not  covered by a certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> if the modified  vehicle is not covered by a certificate of conformity. We may specify  alternate certification provisions consistent with the requirements of  this part. For example, you may certify the modified vehicle for a  partial useful life. For example, if the vehicle is modified halfway  through its original useful life period, you may generally certify the  vehicle based on completing the original useful life period; or if the  vehicle is modified after the original useful life period is past, you  may generally certify the vehicle based on testing that does not involve  further durability demonstration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicles (or engines) may be certified using the certification  procedures for new vehicles (or engines) as specified in this part or  using the certification procedures for aftermarket parts as specified in  40 CFR part 85, subpart V. Unless the original vehicle manufacturer  continues to be responsible for the vehicle as specified in paragraph  (d) of this section, you must remove the original manufacturer's  emission control information label if you recertify the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The original vehicle manufacturer is not responsible for  operation of modified vehicles in configurations resulting from  modifications performed by others. In cases where the modification  allows a vehicle to be operated in either its original configuration or  a modified configuration, the original vehicle manufacturer remains  responsible for operation of the modified vehicle in its original  configuration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Entities producing conversion kits may obtain certificates of  conformity for the converted vehicles. Such entities are vehicle  manufacturers for purposes of this part.  [73 FR 59255, Oct. 8, 2008]</p>
