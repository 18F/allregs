                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section describes the extent of Federal funding available under the State's grant, as well as limitations and special procedures applicable to each.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amounts of Assistance. The total Federal contribution of funds is based on the estimated aggregate grant amount to be made under 42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5172, 5173, 5174, 5177, and 5183 of the Stafford Act for the major disaster (less associated administrative costs), and shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard percentages. Not to exceed 15 percent for the first $2,000,000,000 or less of such amounts; not to exceed 10 percent of the portion of such amounts over $2,000,000,000 and not more than $10,000,000,000; and not to exceed 7.5 percent of the portion of such amounts over $10,000,000,000 and not more than $35,333,000,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Twenty (20) percent. A State with an approved Enhanced State Mitigation Plan, in effect before the disaster declaration, which meets the requirements outlined in Sec. 201.5 of this subchapter shall be eligible for assistance under the HMGP not to exceed 20 percent of such amounts, for amounts not more than $35.333 billion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The estimates of Federal assistance under this paragraph (b) shall be

based on the Regional Administrator's estimate of all eligible costs, actual grants, and appropriate mission assignments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost sharing. All mitigation measures approved under the State's grant will be subject to the cost sharing provisions established in the FEMA-State Agreement. FEMA may contribute up to 75 percent of the cost of measures approved for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for major disasters declared on or after June 10, 1993. FEMA may contribute up to 50 percent of the cost of measures approved for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for major disasters declared before June 10, 1993. The nonFederal share may exceed the Federal share. FEMA will not contribute to costs above the Federally approved estimate.
