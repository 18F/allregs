                            <p class="depth0">For a definition of the term ``withholding agent'' see Sec. 1.1441- 7(a). Any other terms that are defined in section 7701 and that are not  defined in Sec. Sec. 301.7701-1 to 301.7701-15, inclusive, shall, when  used in this chapter, have the meanings assigned to them in section  7701.  (Secs. 1441(c)(4) (80 Stat. 1553; 26 U.S.C. 1441(c)(4)), 3401(a)(6) (80  Stat. 1554; 26 U.S.C. 3401(a)(6)), and 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C.  7805), Internal Revenue Code of 1954)  [T.D. 7977, 49 FR 36836, Sept. 20, 1984]     Sec. 301.7701-17T  Collective-bargaining plans and agreements (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: How did the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA of 1984) change the  laws with respect to plans that are maintained pursuant to collective  bargaining agreements?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Many of the requirements and rules applicable to deferred  compensation and welfare benefit plans are different for plans  maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Prior to the  TRA of 1984, the Internal Revenue Code provided no clear definition of  an employee representative or whether there is a collective bargaining  agreement between such employee representative and one or more  employers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 526(c) of the TRA of 1984 added a new condition under a  new section 7701(a)(46) that must be satisfied in order for a plan to be  considered to be a plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining  agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers for  purposes of the Code after March 31, 1984. If more than one-half of the  membership of an organization is comprised of owners, officers, and  executives of employers covered by the plan, then such organization is  not an employee representative for purposes of determining whether a  plan is to be treated as maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining  agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.  Whether an individual is an owner, officer or executive is to be  determined separately with respect to each employer. Additionally,  section 7701(a)(46) provides that the Internal Revenue Service shall  make the determination for purposes of the Code as to whether there is a  collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one  or more employers.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: If an organization does not fail to be an employee  representative under the 50 percent or less test of section 7701(a)(46),  is a plan maintained pursuant to an agreement between such organization  and one or more employers necessarily treated, under the Code, as a plan  maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between an  employee representative and one or more employers?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) No.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific Code provisions generally require other conditions than  that in section 7701(a)(46) to be satisfied in order for a plan to be  considered to be collectively-bargained. For example, in order for a  plan to be described in section 413(a), the Secretary of Labor must find  that the plan is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining  agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(5)</em>, and (3) the percentage  condition in section 7701(a)(46) is satisfied, the Internal Revenue  Service has the authority, pursuant to section 7701(a)(46), to determine  whether there is a collective bargaining agreement under the Code.

[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15241, Apr. 27, 1992; 58 FR 17516, Apr. 5, 1993; as  amended by T.D. 8733, 62 FR 53386, Oct. 14, 1997]    Sec. 301.7701(b)-1  Resident alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> which  treats income from interest-bearing obligations of residents as income  from sources within the United States.) The regulations do not apply and  Sec. Sec. 1.871-2 and 1.871-5 of this chapter continue to apply for  purposes of the bona fide residence test of section 911. See Sec.  1.911-2(c) of this chapter. For purposes of determining whether an  individual is a resident of the United States for estate and gift tax  purposes, see Sec. 20.0-1(b)(1) and (2) and Sec. 25.2501-1(b) of this  chapter, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lawful permanent resident--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Green card test. An alien is a  resident alien with respect to a calendar year if the individual is a  lawful permanent resident at any time during the calendar year. A lawful  permanent resident is an individual who has been lawfully granted the  privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant  in accordance with the immigration laws. Resident status is deemed to  continue unless it is rescinded or administratively or judicially  determined to have been abandoned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rescission of resident status. Resident status is considered to  be rescinded if a final administrative or judicial order of exclusion or  deportation is issued regarding the alien individual. For purposes of  this paragraph, the term ``final judicial order'' means an order that is  no longer subject to appeal to a higher court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of  resident status. An administrative or judicial determination of  abandonment of resident status may be initiated by the alien individual,  the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), or a consular officer.  If the alien initiates this determination, resident status is considered  to be abandoned when the individual's application for abandonment (INS  Form I-407) or a letter stating the alien's intent to abandon his or her  resident status, with the Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I- 151 or Form I-551) enclosed, is filed with the INS or a consular  officer. If INS replaces any of the form numbers referred to in this  paragraph or Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(f), refer to the comparable INS  replacement form number. For purposes of this paragraph, an   alien individual shall be considered to have filed a letter stating the  intent to abandon resident status with the INS or a consular office if  such letter is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested (or a  foreign country's equivalent thereof). A copy of the letter, along with  proof that the letter was mailed and received, should be retained by the  alien individual. If the INS or a consular officer initiates this  determination, resident status will be considered to be abandoned upon  the issuance of a final administrative order of abandonment. If an  individual is granted an appeal to a federal court of competent  jurisdiction, a final judicial order is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Substantial presence test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An alien individual  is a resident alien if the individual meets the substantial presence  test. An individual satisfies this test if he or she has been present in  the United States on at least 183 days during a three year period that  includes the current year. For purposes of this test, each day of  presence in the current year is counted as a full day. Each day of  presence in the first preceding year is counted as one-third of a day  and each day of presence in the second preceding year is counted as one- sixth of a day. For purposes of this paragraph, any fractional days  resulting from the above calculations will not be rounded to the nearest  whole number. (See Sec. 301.7701(b)-9(b)(2) for transitional rules for  calendar years 1985 and 1986.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of presence--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Physical presence. For purposes  of the substantial presence test, an individual shall be treated as  present in the United States on any day that he or she is physically  present in the United States at any time during the day. (But see Sec.  301.7701(b)-3 relating to days of presence that may be excluded.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> United States. For purposes of section 7701(b) and the  regulations thereunder, the term United States when used in a  geographical sense includes the states and the District of Columbia. It  also includes the territorial waters of the United States and the seabed  and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the  territorial waters of the United States and over which the United States  has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect  to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. It does not  include the possessions and territories of the United States or the air  space over the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Current year. The term current year means any calendar year for  which an alien individual is determining his or her resident status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Thirty-one day minimum. If an individual is not physically  present for more than 30 days during the current year, the substantial  presence test will not be applied for that year even if the three-year  total is 183 or more days. For purposes of the substantial presence  test, it is irrelevant that an individual was not present for more than  30 days in the first or second year preceding the current year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application of section 7701(b) to the possessions and  territories--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application to aliens for purposes of mirror systems.  Section 7701(b) provides the basis for determining whether an alien  individual is a resident of a United States possession or territory that  administers income tax laws that are identical (except for the  substitution of the name of the possession or territory for the term  ``United States'' where appropriate) to those in force in the United  States, for purposes of applying such laws with respect to income tax  liability incurred to such possession or territory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-application for bona fide resident determination. Section  7701(b) does not provide the basis for determining whether an individual  (including an alien individual) is a bona fide resident of a United  States possession or territory for Federal income tax purposes. For the  applicable rules for making this determination, see section 937(a) and  Sec. 1.937-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B, an alien individual, is present in the United States  for 122 days in the current year. He was present in the United States  for 122 days in the first preceding calendar year and for 122 days in  the second preceding calendar year. In determining his status for the  current year, B counts all 122 days in the United States in the current  year plus \1/3\ of the 122 days in the United States in the first  preceding calendar year (40\2/3\ days)   and \1/6\ of the 122 days in the United States during the second  preceding calendar year (20\1/3\ days). The total of 122+40\2/3\+20\1/3\  equals 183 days. B meets the substantial presence test and is a resident  alien for the current year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C, an alien individual, is present in the United States  for 25 days during the current year. She was present in the United  States for 365 days during the first preceding year and 365 days during  the second preceding year. The substantial presence test does not apply  because C is present in the United States for fewer than 31 days during  the current year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. D, an alien individual, is present in the United States  for 170 days during the current year. He was present in the United  States for 30 days during the first preceding year and 30 days during  the second preceding year. In determining his status for the current  year, D counts all 170 days in the United States in the current year  plus \1/3\ of the 30 days in the United States in the first preceding  calendar year (10 days) and \1/6\ of the 30 days in the United States  during the second preceding calendar year (5 days). The total of  170+10+5 equals 185 days. D meets the substantial presence test and is a  resident alien for the current year notwithstanding the fact that he was  present in the United States for fewer than 31 days in each of the two  preceding years.  [T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15242, Apr. 27, 1992; 57 FR 28612, June 26, 1992; 57  FR 37190, Aug. 18, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9194, 70 FR 18947, Apr. 11,  2005; T.D. 9391, 73 FR 19377, Apr. 9, 2008]    Sec. 301.7701(b)-2  Closer connection exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An alien individual who meets the substantial  presence test may nevertheless be considered a nonresident alien for the  current year if the following conditions are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual is present in the United States for fewer than  183 days in the current year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The individual maintains a tax home in a foreign country during  the current year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the  individual has a closer connection during the current year to a single  foreign country in which he or she maintains a tax home than to the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and the  regulations thereunder, the term ``foreign country'' when used in a  geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of the  United Nations or a government other than that of the United States. It  includes the territorial waters of the foreign country (determined in  accordance with the laws of the United States), and the seabed and  subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial  waters of the foreign country and over which the foreign country has  exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to  the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. It also includes  the possessions and territories of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tax home--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. For purposes of section 7701 (b) and  the regulations under that section, the term ``tax home'' has the same  meaning that it has for purposes of section 162(a)(2) (relating to  travel expenses while away from home). Thus, an individual's tax home is  considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if  more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no  regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the  business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any  trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the  individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a  real and substantial sense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Duration and nature of tax home. The tax home maintained by the  alien individual must be in existence for the entire current year. The  tax home must be located in the same foreign country for which the  individual is claiming to have the closer connection described in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Closer connection to a foreign country--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For  purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section, an  alien individual will be considered to have a closer connection to a  foreign country than the United States if the individual or the  Commissioner establishes that the individual has maintained more  significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United  States. In determining whether an individual has maintained more  significant contacts with a foreign country than the United States,   the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not  limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The location of the individual's permanent home;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The location of the individual's family;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The location of personal belongings, such as automobiles,  furniture, clothing and jewelry owned by the individual and his or her  family;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The location of social, political, cultural or religious  organizations with which the individual has a current relationship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The location where the individual conducts his or her routine  personal banking activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The location where the individual conducts business activities  (other than those that constitute the individual's tax home);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual holds  a driver's license;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual  votes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The country of residence designated by the individual on forms  and documents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The types of official forms and documents filed by the  individual, such as Form 1078 (Certificate of Alien Claiming Residence  in the United States), Form W-8 (Certificate of Foreign Status) or Form  W-9 (Payer's Request for Taxpayer ldentification Number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permanent home. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section, it is immaterial whether a permanent home is a house, an  apartment, or a furnished room.

In computing days of presence in the United States,  an alien is considered to be present if the individual is physically  present in the United States at any time during the day (see Sec.  301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(i)). However, for purposes of section 7701(b) and  the regulations under that section, the following days shall be excluded  and will not count as days of presence in the United States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any day that an individual is present in the United States as an  exempt individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any day that an individual is prevented from leaving the United  States because of a medical condition that arose while the individual  was present in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any day that an individual is in transit between two points  outside the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any day on which a regular commuter residing in Canada or Mexico  commutes to and from employment in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exempt individuals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An exempt individual is an  individual who is either a--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign government-related individual as defined in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Teacher or trainee as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Student as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Professional athlete as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign government-related individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The term  ``international organization'' means any public international  organization that has been designated by the President by Executive  Order as being entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and  immunities provided for in the International Organizations Act (22  U.S.C. 288). An individual described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section will be a full-time employee of an international organization if  that individual's employment with the organization is consistent with an  employment schedule of a person with a standard full-time work schedule  with the organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Full-time diplomatic or consular status. An individual is  considered to have full-time diplomatic or consular status if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual has been accredited by a foreign government  recognized de jure or de facto by the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual intends to engage primarily in official  activities for that foreign government while in the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The individual has been recognized by the President, or by the  Secretary of State, or by a consular officer acting on behalf of the  Secretary of State, as being entitled to such status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Teacher or trainee. A teacher or trainee includes any individual  (and that individual's immediate family), other than a student, who is  admitted temporarily to the United States as a nonimmigrant under  section 101(a)(15) (J) (relating to the admission of teachers and  trainees into the United States) or section 101(a)(15)(Q) (relating to  the admission of participants in   international cultural exchange programs) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (J), (Q)) and who substantially  complies with the requirements of being admitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Student. A student is any individual (and that individual's  immediate family) who is admitted temporarily to the United States as a  nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F) or (M) (relating to the  admission of students into the United States) or as a student under  section 101(a)(15)(J) (relating to the admission of teachers and  trainees into the United States) or section 101(a)(15)(Q) (relating to  the admission of participants in international cultural exchange  programs) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)  (F), (J), (M), (Q)) who substantially complies with the requirements of  being admitted. For rules concerning taxation of certain nonresident  students or trainees, see section 871(c) and Sec. 1.871-9(a) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Professional athlete. A professional athlete is an individual  who is temporarily present in the United States to compete in a  charitable sports event described in section 274(l)(1)(B). For purposes  of computing the days of presence in the United States, only days on  which the athlete actually competes in a charitable sports event  described in section 274(l)(1)(B) shall be excluded. Thus, days on which  the individual is present to practice for the event, to perform  promotional or other activities related to the event, or to travel  between events shall be included for purposes of the substantial  presence test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Substantial compliance. An individual described in paragraph (b)  (3) or (4) of this section will be deemed to comply substantially with  the visa requirements relevant to residence for tax purposes if the  individual has not engaged in activities that are prohibited by the  Immigration and Nationality Act and the regulations thereunder and could  result in the loss of F, J or M visa status. An individual will not be  deemed to comply substantially with the visa requirements relevant to  residence for tax purposes merely by showing that the individual's visa  has not been revoked. An independent determination of substantial  compliance may be made by the Internal Revenue Service for any  individual claiming to be an exempt individual under paragraph (b) (3)  or (4) of this section. For example, if an individual with an F visa  (student visa) is found to have accepted unauthorized employment or to  have maintained a course of study that is not considered by the Internal  Revenue Service to be full-time, the individual will not be considered  to comply substantially with the individual's visa requirements  regardless of whether the individual's visa has been revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Limitation on teacher or trainee and student exemptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Teacher or trainee limitation in general.

If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A teacher or trainee receives compensation in the current year  and all of that compensation is described in section 872(b)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That individual was present in the United States as a teacher or  trainee in any prior year within the last 6 years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> During each prior year (within the 6 year period) in which the  individual was present as a teacher or trainee, the individual received  compensation all of which was described in section 872(b)(3);  Then that individual shall include days of presence as a teacher or  trainee in the current year only if the individual has been exempt as a  teacher, trainee, or student for any part of four of the six preceding  calendar years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitation on student exemption. An individual will not be  able to exclude days of presence as a student if the individual has been  exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of more than five  calendar years, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the  district director that the individual does not intend to reside  permanently in the United States and has substantially complied with the  requirements of the student visa providing for the individual's  temporary   presence in the United States. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(7),  the facts and circumstances to be considered in determining if an  individual has demonstrated an intent to reside permanently in the  United States include (but are not limited to)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the individual has maintained a closer connection with a  foreign country as described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-2; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether the individual has taken affirmative steps within the  meaning of paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2 to adjust the  individual's status from nonimmigrant to lawful permanent resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transition rule. The rules in this paragraph (b)(7) relating to  stated periods of exempt status apply only for those stated periods that  occur after 1984. Thus, for example, an alien who is present as a  student during the calendar years 1982-1990 will not be subject to the  five year rule for students until 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraphs (b)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B is temporarily present in the United States during the  current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J)  of the Immigration and Nationality Act. B does not receive compensation  described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. B has been treated  as an exempt student for the past three years. Although this is the  first year that B is seeking to be exempt as a teacher, he will not be  considered an exempt individual for the year because he has been exempt  as a student for at least two of the past six years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C is temporarily present in the United States during the  current year as a teacher and receives compensation described in section  872(b)(3) in the current year. C has been treated as an exempt teacher  for the past two years but C's compensation for those years was not  described in section 872(b)(3). C will not be considered an exempt  individual for the current year because she has been exempt as a teacher  for at least two of the past six years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that all  of C's compensation for the two preceding years was described in section  872(b)(3). C will be considered to be an exempt individual for the  current year because she has not been exempt as a student, teacher or  trainee for four of the six preceding calendar years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. D is temporarily present in the United States during the  current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J)  of the Immigration and Nationality Act. D does not receive compensation  described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. D entered the United  States in December of the second preceding year and intends to remain in  the United States until June of the current year. D will not be  considered an exempt individual for the current year because he has been  exempt as a teacher for at least two of the past six years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Immediate family. The immediate family of an exempt individual  includes the individual's spouse and unmarried children (whether by  blood or adoption) but only if the spouse's or unmarried children's visa  status are derived from and dependent on the visa classification of the  exempt individual. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term  unmarried children means those children who are under 21 years of age,  who reside regularly in the household of the exempt individual, and who  are not members of some other household. The immediate family of an  exempt individual does not include the attendants, servants, and  personal employees of that individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Medical condition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An individual will not be  considered present on any day that the individual intends to leave and  is unable to leave the United States because of a medical condition or  medical problem that arose while the individual was present in the  United States. A day of presence will not be excluded if the individual,  who was initially prevented from leaving, is subsequently able to leave  the United States and then remains in the United States beyond a  reasonable period for making arrangements to leave the United States. A  day will also not be excluded if the medical condition arose during a  prior stay in the United States (whether or not days of presence during  the prior stay were excluded) and the alien returns to the United States  for treatment of the medical condition or medical problem that arose  during the prior stay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intent to leave the United States. For purposes of paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, whether an individual intends to leave the  United States on a particular day will be determined based on all the  facts and circumstances. Thus, if at the time an individual's medical  condition or medical problem arose,   the individual was present in the United States for a definite purpose  which by its nature could be accomplished within the United States  during a period of time that would not cause the individual to be a  resident under the substantial presence test, the individual may be able  to establish that he or she intended to leave the United States.  However, if the individual's purpose is of such a nature that an  extended period of time would be required for its accomplishment  (sufficient to cause the individual to be a resident under the  substanial presence test), the individual would not be able to establish  the requisite intent to leave the United States. If the individual is  present in the United States for no particular purpose or a purpose by  its nature that does not require a specific period of time to  accomplish, the determination of whether the individual has the  requisite intent to leave the United States will depend on all the  surrounding facts and circumstances. In the case of an individual  adjudicated mentally incompetent, proof of intent to leave the United  States may be determined by analyzing the incompetent's pattern of  behavior prior to the adjudication of incompetence. Generally, an  individual will be presumed to have intended to leave during a period of  illness if the individual leaves the United States within a reasonable  period of time (time to make arrangements to leave) after becoming  physically able to leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pre-existing medical condition. A medical condition or problem  will not be considered to arise while the individual is present in the  United States, if the condition or problem existed prior to the  individual's arrival in the United States, and the individual was aware  of the condition or problem, regardless of whether the individual  required treatment for the condition or problem when the individual  entered the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B is in a serious automobile accident in the United  States on March 25. B intended to leave the United States on March 31  (as evidenced by an airline ticket), but was unable to leave on that  date as a result of the injuries suffered in the accident. B recovered  from the injuries and was able to leave and did leave the United States  on May 31. B's presence in the United States during the period from  April 1 through May 31 will not be counted as days of presence in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B's  return flight (as evidenced by an airline ticket) was scheduled for May  31. Because B did not intend to leave the United States until May 31, B  may not exclude any days of presence in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Days in transit. An alien individual may exclude days of  presence in the United States if the individual is in transit between  two foreign points, and is physically present in the United States for  fewer than 24 hours. For purposes of this paragraph, an individual will  be considered to be in transit if the individual pursues activities that  are substantially related to completing his or her travel to a foreign  point of destination. For example, an alien who travels between airports  in the United States in order to change planes en route to the  individual's destination will be considered to be in transit. However,  if the individual attends a business meeting while he or she is present  in the United States, whether or not that meeting is within the confines  of the airport, the individual will not be considered to be in transit.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``foreign point'' means any  areas that are not included within the definition of the term ``United  States'' provided in Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Regular commuters from Mexico or Canada--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An  alien individual will not be considered to be present in the United  States on days that the individual commutes to the United States from  the individual's residence in Mexico or Canada if the individual  regularly commutes from Mexico or Canada. An alien individual will be  considered to commute regularly if the individual commutes to the  individual's location of employment or self-employment in the United  States from his or her residence in Mexico or Canada on more than 75% of  the workdays during the working period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term commutes means to travel to employment  or self-   employment and to return to one's residence within a 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term workdays means days on which the individual works in  the United States or Canada or Mexico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term working period means the period beginning with the  first day in the current year on which the individual is physically  present in the United States for purposes of engaging in employment or  self-employment and ending on the last day in the current year on which  the individual is physically present in the United States for purposes  of engaging in that employment or self-employment. If the nature of the  employment or self-employment is such that it requires the individual to  be present in the United States only on a seasonal or cyclical basis,  the working period will begin with the first day of the season or cycle  on which the individual is present in the United States for purposes of  engaging in that employment or self-employment and end on the last day  of the season or cycle on which the individual is present in the United  States for the purpose of engaging in that employment or self- employment. Thus, there may be more than one working period in a  calendar year and a working period may begin in one calendar year and  end in the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of  this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B lives in Mexico and is employed by Corporation X in its  office in Mexico. B was temporarily assigned to X's office in the United  States. B's employment in the United States office began on February 1,  1988, and continued through June 1, 1988. On June 2, B resumed his  employment in Mexico. On 59 days in the period beginning on February 1,  1988, and ending on June 1, 1988, B travelled each morning from his  residence in Mexico to X Corporation's United States office for the  purpose of engaging in his employment with X Corporation. B returned to  his residence in Mexico on each of those evenings. On seven days in the  period from February 1, 1988, through June 1, 1988, B worked in X's  Mexico office. B is not considered to have been present in the United  States on any of the days that he travelled to X's United States office  for the purpose of engaging in employment with Corporation X because he  commuted to his place of employment within the United States on more  than 75% of the workdays during the working period (59 workdays in the  United States/66 workdays in the working period=89.4%).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C, who lives in Canada, contracted with a resort located  in the United States to provide snow-skiing instructions for the  resort's customers for two skiing seasons, the first beginning on  November 15, 1987, and ending on March 15, 1988, and the second  beginning on November 15, 1988, and ending on March 15, 1989. On 90 days  in each of the two skiing seasons, C travelled in the morning from  Canada to the resort to provide skiing instructions pursuant to the  contract. C returned to Canada on each of those evenings. On 20 days  during each of the two skiing seasons, C worked in Canada.

Beginning on  February 15, 1988, and ending on March 25, 1988, D commuted to work in  his Canadian office on 30 days. Beginning on March 28, 1988, and ending  on May 27, 1988, D commuted to work in his United States office on 45  days. Subsequent to May 27, D did not commute to the United States on  any other days in 1988. D is considered to have been present in the  United States on each day that he travelled to his office in the United  States because D did not commute to the United States office on more  than 75% of the workdays during the working period beginning on January  4, 1988, and ending on May 27, 1988 (75 workdays in the United States/ 105 workdays in the working period=71.4%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determination of excluded days applies beyond year of  determination.

An alien individual who was not a  United States resident during the preceding calendar year and who is a  United States resident for the current year will begin to be a resident  for tax purposes on the alien's residency starting date. The residency  starting date for an alien who meets the substantial presence test is  the first day during the calendar year on which the individual is  present in the United States. The residency starting date for an alien  who meets the lawful permanent resident test (green card test),  described in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 301.7701(b)-1, is the first day  during the calendar year in which the individual is physically present  in the United States as a lawful permanent resident. The residency  starting date for an alien who satisfies both the substantial presence  test and the green card test will be the earlier of the first day the  individual is physically present in the United States as a lawful  permanent resident of the United States or the first day during the year  that the individual is present for purposes of the substantial presence  test. (See Sec. 301.7701(b)-9(b)(1) for the transitional rule relating  to the residency starting date of an alien individual who was a lawful  permanent resident in 1984. See also Sec. 301.7701(b)-3 for days that  may be excluded.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Last year of residency--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An alien individual  who is a United States resident during the current year but who is not a  United States resident at any time during the following calendar year  will cease to be a resident for tax purposes on the individual's  residency termination date. Generally, the residency termination date  will be the last day of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  the residency termination date for an alien individual who meets the  substantial presence test is the last day during the calendar year that  the individual is physically present in the United States if the  individual establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, the  individual's tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained  a closer connection (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(b)-2(d)) to  that foreign country than to the United States. Similarly, the residency  termination date for an alien who meets the green card test is the first  day during the calendar year that the alien is no longer a lawful  permanent resident if the individual establishes that, for the remainder  of the calendar year, his or her tax home was in a foreign country and  he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country than to  the United States. The residency termination date for an alien who  satisfies both the substantial presence test and the green card test for  the current year, will be the later of the first day the individual is  no longer a lawful permanent resident of the United States or the last  day the individual was physically present in the United States if the  alien establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, his or  her tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer  connection to that foreign country than to the United States. It is  immaterial whether the individual's tax home was in the United States,  or that the individual had a closer connection to the United States than  to the foreign country, prior to the date of his or her departure from  the United States or the date on which the individual was no longer a  lawful permanent resident, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules relating to residency starting date and residency  termination date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> De minimis presence. An alien individual may be  present in the United States for up to 10 days without triggering the  residency starting date (for purposes of the substantial presence test)  or extending the residency termination date (for purposes of the  substantial presence test) if the individual is able to establish that,  during that period, the individual's tax home was in a foreign country  and he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country  than to the United States. Days from more than one period of presence  may be disregarded for purposes of determining an individual's residency  starting date or termination date so long as the total is not more than  10 days. However, an individual may not disregard any days that occur in  a period of consecutive days of presence, if   all the days that occur during that period cannot be excluded.

The alien individual may not make this  election until such time as he has satisfied the substantial presence  test for the year following the election year. If an alien   individual has not satisfied the substantial presence test for the year  following the election year as of the due date (not including  extensions) of the tax return for the election year, the alien  individual may request an extension of time for filing the return until  a reasonable period after he or she has satisfied such test, provided  that the individual pays with his or her extension application the  amount of tax he or she expects to owe for the election year computed as  if he or she were a nonresident alien throughout the election year.

B is able to establish a  closer connection to country X for the period January 6-10. On March 1,  1985, B moves to the United States and resides here until August 20,  1985, when he returns to country X. On December 12, 1985, B comes to the  United States for pleasure and stays here until December 16, 1985 when  he returns to country X. B is able to establish a closer connection to  country X for the period December 12-16. B is not a United States  resident for tax purposes during the following year and can establish a  closer connection to country X for the remainder of calendar year 1985.  B is a resident of the United States under the substantial presence test  because B is present in the United States for 183 days (5 days in  January plus 173 days for the period March 1-August 20 plus 5 days in  December). B's residency starting date is March 1, 1985, and his  residency termination date is August 20, 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B  remains in the United States until December 17, 1985, and is able to  establish a closer connection to country X for the period December 18  through 31.

C, a citizen of foreign country Y, is an alien who has  never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. C comes to  the United States for the first time on February 10, 1985, and attends a  business conference until February 24, 1985, when she returns to country  Y. On April 20, 1985, C enters the United States as a lawful permanent  resident. On November 10, 1985, C ceases to be a lawful permanent  resident but stays on in the United States until November 20, 1985 when  she returns to country Y. On December 8, 1985, C comes to the United  States and stays here until December 17, 1985 when she returns to  country Y. She can establish a closer connection to country Y for that  period. C is not a resident of the United States during the following  calendar year and can establish a closer connection to country Y for the  remainder of calendar year 1985. C qualifies as a United States resident  under both the green card test and the substantial presence test. C's  residency starting date under the green card test is April 20, 1985.  Under the substantial presence test, C's residency starting date is  February 10, 1985, because she is present for more than ten days in  February and cannot take advantage of the de minimis presence rule.  Therefore, C's residency starting date is February 10, 1985. C's  residency termination date under the green card test is November 10,  1985. Her residency termination date under the substantial presence test  is November 20, because B can disregard ten days of presence in  December. Thus, her residency termination date is November 20, 1985, the  later of her residency termination date under the substantial presence  test or the green card test.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

C may take advantage of only ten days of de minimis  presence and may exclude days from a continuous period of presence only  if she can exclude all the days that occur during that period. Thus, C  may choose either of the following periods of residency: residency  starting date February 5, 1985, and residency termination date November  20, 1985, or residency starting date April 20, 1985, and residency  termination date December 17, 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5.

D returns to country Z on December 1 and does not come back to  the United States until December 17, 1985. He remains in the United  States for the rest of the year. During 1986, D is a resident of the  United States under the substantial presence test. D may elect to be  treated as a resident of the United States for 1985 because he was  present in the United States in 1985 for a 31 consecutive day period of  presence (November 1 through December 1, 1985) and for at least 75  percent of the days following (and including) the first day of D's 31  consecutive day period of presence (46 total days of presence in the  United States/61 days in the period from November 1 through December  31=75.4%).

From November 1, 1985 through  December 31, 1985, F is present in the United States for 38 days.  Although F satisfies two 31 consecutive day periods of presence,  (January 1 through January 31 and October 1 through November 1), she  satisfies the continuous presence requirement only with regard to the  later period of presence (69 total days of presence/92 days in the  period from October 1 through December 31=75%).

B is also a resident of the United  States under the Internal Revenue Code. B is considered to be a resident  of country X under the convention. The convention does not specifically  deal with characterization of foreign corporations as controlled foreign  corporations or the taxability of United States shareholders on  inclusions of subpart F income, but it provides, in an ``Other Income''  article similar to Article 21 of the 1981 draft of the United States  Model Income Tax Convention (U.S. Model), that items of income of a  resident of country X that are not specifically dealt with in the  convention shall be taxable only in country X. B owns 80% of the one  class of stock of foreign corporation R. The remaining 20% is owned by  C, a United States citizen who is unrelated to B. In 1985, corporation  R's only income is interest that is foreign personal holding company  income under Sec. 1.954A-2 of this chapter. Because the United States-X  income tax convention does not deal with characterization of foreign  corporations as controlled foreign corporations, United States internal  income tax law applies. Therefore, B and C are United States  shareholders within the meaning of Sec. 1.951-1(g) of this chapter,  corporation R is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of  Sec. 1.957-1 of this chapter, and corporation R's income is included in  C's income as subpart F income under Sec. 1.951-1 of this chapter. B  may avoid current taxation on his share of the subpart F inclusion by  filing as a nonresident (i.e., by following the procedure in Sec.  301.7701(b)-7(b)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B  also earns United States source dividend income. The United States-X  income tax convention provides that the rate of United States tax on  United States source dividends paid to residents of country X shall not  exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. B's United  States tax liability with respect to the dividends would be smaller if  he were treated as a resident alien, subject to tax on a net basis  (i.e., after the allowance of deductions) than if he were treated as a  nonresident alien. If, however, B chooses to file as a nonresident in  order to claim treaty benefits with respect to his share of R's subpart  F income, his overall United States tax liability, including the portion  attributable to the dividends, must be determined as if he were a  nonresident alien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C, a married alien individual with three children, is a  resident of foreign country Y, under Y's internal law. Country Y is a  party to an income tax convention with the United States. C is also a  resident of the United States under the Internal Revenue Code. C is  considered to be a resident of country Y under the convention. The  convention specifically covers, among other items of income, personal  services income, dividends and interest. C is sent by her country Y  employer to work in the United States from January 1, 1985 until  December 31, 1985. During 1985, C also earns United States source  dividends and interest and incurs mortgage interest expenses on her  personal residence. The United States-Y treaty provides that  remuneration for personal services performed in the United States by a  country Y resident is exempt from United States tax if, among other  things, the individual performing such services is present in the United  States for a period that is not in excess of 183 days. The treaty  provides that the rate of United States tax on United States source  dividends paid to residents of Y shall not exceed 15 percent of the  gross amount of the dividends and it exempts residents of Y from United  States tax on United States source interest. In filing her 1985 tax  return, C may choose to file either as a resident alien without claiming  any treaty benefits or as a nonresident alien if she desires to claim  any treaty benefit. C files as a nonresident (i.e. by following the  procedure described in Sec. 301.7701(b)-7(b)). Because C does not  satisfy the requirements of the United States-Y treaty with regard to  exempting personal services income from United States tax, C will be  taxed on her personal services income at graduated rates under section 1  of the Code pursuant to section 871(b) of the Code. She will not be  entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses or to claim more than  one personal exemption because she is taxed as a nonresident alien under  the Code by virtue of her decision to claim treaty benefits, and section  873 of the Code denies nonresidents the deduction for personal residence  mortgage interest expense and generally limits them to only one personal  exemption. C will be subject to a tax of 15 percent of the gross amount  of her dividend income under section 871(a) of the Code as modified by  the treaty, and she will be exempt from tax on her interest income. C is  not entitled to file a joint return with her spouse even if he is a  resident alien under the Code for 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that C  does not choose to claim treaty benefits with respect to any items of  income covered by the treaty (i.e., she files as a resident). Therefore,  she is taxed as a resident under the Code and pays tax at graduated  rates on her personal services income, dividends, and interest. In  addition, she is entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses and  to take personal exemptions for her spouse and three children. C will be  entitled to file a joint return with her spouse if he is a resident  alien for 1985 or, if he is a nonresident alien, C and her spouse   may elect to file a joint return pursuant to section 6013.

This section provides rules for applying section  7701(i), which defines taxable mortgage pools. The purpose of section  7701(i) is to prevent income generated by a pool of real estate  mortgages from escaping Federal income taxation when the pool is used to  issue multiple class mortgage-backed securities. The regulations in this  section and in Sec. Sec. 301.7701(i)-2 through 301.7701(i)-4 are to be  applied in accordance with this purpose. The taxable mortgage pool  provisions apply to entities or portions of entities that qualify for  REMIC status but do not elect to be taxed as REMICs as well as to  certain entities or portions of entities that do not qualify for REMIC  status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A taxable mortgage pool is any entity or portion  of an entity (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-2) that satisfies the  requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) and this section as of any testing  day (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). An entity or portion of  an entity satisfies the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) and this  section if substantially all of its assets are debt obligations, more  than 50 percent of those debt obligations are real estate mortgages, the  entity is the obligor under debt obligations with two or more  maturities, and payments on the debt obligations under which the entity  is obligor bear a relationship to payments on the debt obligations that  the entity holds as assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(B))</em>, unless the context  clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Asset composition tests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of amount of assets.  An entity must use the Federal income tax basis of an asset for purposes  of determining whether substantially all of its assets consist of debt  obligations (or interests therein) and whether more than 50 percent of  those debt obligations (or interests) consist of real estate mortgages  (or interests therein). For purposes of this paragraph, an entity  determines the basis of an asset with the assumption that the entity is  not a taxable mortgage pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantially all--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Whether substantially all of  the assets of an entity consist of debt obligations (or interests  therein) is based on all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section, if less than 80 percent of the assets of an entity consist of  debt obligations (or interests therein), then less than substantially  all of the assets of the entity consist of debt obligations (or  interests therein).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equity interests in pass-through arrangements. The equity  interest of an entity in a partnership, S corporation, trust, REIT, or  other pass-through arrangement is deemed to have the same composition as  the entity's share of the assets of the pass-through arrangement. For  example, if an entity's stock interest in a REIT has an adjusted basis  of $20,000, and the assets of the REIT consist of equal portions of real   estate mortgages and other real estate assets, then the entity is  treated as holding $10,000 of real estate mortgages and $10,000 of other  real estate assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(ii)</em> of this section) is not treated as a separate asset of an  entity for purposes of the asset composition tests set forth in section  7701(i)(2)(A)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, but instead is treated as part of the asset to which  it relates. Furthermore, any collateral supporting a credit enhancement  contract is not treated as an asset of an entity solely because it  supports the guarantee represented by that contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Credit enhancement contract defined. For purposes of this  section, a credit enhancement contract is any arrangement whereby a  person agrees to guarantee full or partial payment of the principal or  interest payable on a debt obligation (or interest therein) or on a pool  of such obligations (or interests), or full or partial payment on one or  more classes of debt obligations under which an entity is the obligor,  in the event of defaults or delinquencies on debt obligations,  unanticipated losses or expenses incurred by the entity, or lower than  expected returns on investments. Types of credit enhancement contracts  may include, but are not limited to, pool insurance contracts,  certificate guarantee insurance contracts, letters of credit,  guarantees, or agreements whereby an entity, a mortgage servicer, or  other third party agrees to make advances (regardless of whether, under  the terms of the agreement, the payor is obligated, or merely permitted,  to make those advances). An agreement by a debt servicer to advance to  an entity out of its own funds an amount to make up for delinquent  payments on debt obligations is a credit enhancement contract. An  agreement by a debt servicer to pay taxes and hazard insurance premiums  on property securing a debt obligation, or other expenses incurred to  protect an entity's security interests in the collateral in the event  that the debtor fails to pay such taxes, insurance premiums, or other  expenses, is a credit enhancement contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certain assets not treated as debt obligations--(i) In general.  For purposes of section 7701</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)(A)</em>, real estate mortgages that are  seriously impaired are not treated as debt obligations. Whether a  mortgage is seriously impaired is based on all the facts and  circumstances including, but not limited to: the number of days  delinquent, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage (based  upon the operating income from the property), and the debtor's financial  position and stake in the property. However, except as provided in  paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, no single factor in and of itself  is determinative of whether a loan is seriously impaired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Unless an entity is receiving or  anticipates receiving payments with respect to a mortgage, a single  family residential real estate mortgage is seriously impaired if  payments on the mortgage are more than 89 days delinquent, and a multi- family residential or commercial real estate mortgage is seriously  impaired if payments on the mortgage are more than 59 days delinquent.  Whether an entity anticipates receiving payments with respect to a  mortgage is based on all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payments with respect to a mortgage defined. For purposes of  paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, payments with respect to a  mortgage mean any payments on the mortgage as defined in paragraph  (f)(2)(i) of this section if those payments are substantial and  relatively certain as to amount and any payments on the mortgage as  defined in paragraph (f)(2) (ii) or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Entity treated as not anticipating payments. With respect to any  testing day (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)), an entity is  treated as not having anticipated receiving payments on the mortgage as  defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if 180 days after the  testing day, and despite making reasonable efforts to resolve the  mortgage, the entity is not receiving such payments and has not entered  into any agreement to receive such payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Real estate mortgages or interests therein defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(i), the   term real estate mortgages (or interests therein) includes all--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obligations (including participations or certificates of  beneficial ownership therein) that are principally secured by an  interest in real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Regular and residual interests in a REMIC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stripped bonds and stripped coupons (as defined in section  1286(e) (2) and (3)) if the bonds (as defined in section 1286(e)(1))  from which such stripped bonds or stripped coupons arose would have  qualified as real estate mortgages or interests therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interests in real property and real property defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general.

For purposes of this section, the  definition of real property includes manufactured housing, provided the  properties qualify as single family residences under section 25(e)(10)  and without regard to the treatment of the properties under state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The 80 percent test. An obligation is principally secured by an  interest in real property if the fair market value of the interest in  real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) securing  the obligation was at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue  price of the obligation at the time the obligation was originated (that  is, the issue date). For purposes of this test, the fair market value of  the real property interest is first reduced by the amount of any lien on  the real property interest that is senior to the obligation being  tested, and is reduced further by a proportionate amount of any lien  that is in parity with the obligation being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Alternative test. An obligation is principally secured by an  interest in real property if substantially all of the proceeds of the  obligation were used to acquire, improve, or protect an interest in real  property that, at the origination date, is the only security for the  obligation. For purposes of this test, loan guarantees made by Federal,  state, local governments or agencies, or other third party credit  enhancement, are not viewed as additional security for a loan. An  obligation is not considered to be secured by property other than real  property solely because the obligor is personally liable on the  obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligations secured by real estate mortgages (or interests  therein), or by combinations of real estate mortgages (or interests  therein) and other assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An obligation secured only by  real estate mortgages (or interests therein), as defined in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, is treated as an obligation secured by an  interest in real property to the extent of the value of the real estate  mortgages (or interests therein). An obligation secured by both real  estate mortgages (or interests therein) and other assets is treated as  an obligation secured by an interest in real property to the extent of  both the value of the real estate mortgages (or interests therein) and  the value of so much of the other assets that constitute real property.  Thus, under this paragraph, a collateralized mortgage obligation may be  an obligation principally secured by an interest in real property. This  section is applicable only to obligations issued after December 31,  1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (d)(3)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example. At the time it is originated, an obligation has an adjusted  issue price of $300,000 and is secured by a $70,000 loan principally  secured by an interest in a single family home, a fifty percent co- ownership interest in a $400,000 parcel of land, and $80,000 of stock.  Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the obligation is treated  as secured by interests in real property and under paragraph  (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the obligation is treated as principally  secured by interests in real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Two or more maturities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section  7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), debt obligations have two or more maturities if they  have different stated maturities or if the holders of the obligations  possess different rights concerning the acceleration of or delay in the  maturities of the obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally. Debt  obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally do not have, by  that reason alone, two or more maturities. Credit risk is the risk that  payments of principal or interest will be reduced or delayed because of  a default on an asset that supports the debt obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation M transfers a pool of real estate  mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class A bonds and a certificate  representing the residual beneficial ownership of the pool. All Class A  bonds have a stated maturity of March 1, 2002, but if cash flows from  the real estate mortgages and investments are sufficient, the trustee  may select one or more bonds at random and redeem them earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class A bonds do not have different maturities. Each  outstanding Class A bond has an equal chance of being redeemed because  the selection process is random. The holders of the Class A bonds,  therefore, have identical rights concerning the maturities of their  obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation N transfers a pool of real estate  mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D bonds, and  a certificate representing the residual beneficial ownership of the  pool. The Class D bonds are subordinate to the Class C bonds so that  cash flow shortfalls due to defaults or delinquencies on the real estate  mortgages are borne first by the Class D bond holders. The terms of the  bonds are otherwise identical in all relevant aspects except that the  Class D bonds carry a higher coupon rate because of the subordination  feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class C bonds and the Class D bonds share credit risk  unequally because of the subordination feature. However, neither this  difference, nor the difference in interest rates, causes the bonds to  have different maturities. The result is the same if, in addition to the  other terms described in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, the Class C  bonds are accelerated as a result of the issuer becoming unable to make  payments on the Class C bonds as they become due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Relationship test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section  7701(i)(2)(A)(iii), payments on debt obligations under which an entity  is the obligor (liability obligations) bear a relationship to payments  (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) on debt obligations an  entity holds as assets (asset obligations) if under the terms of the  liability obligations (or underlying arrangement) the timing and amount  of payments on the liability obligations are in large part determined by  the timing and amount of payments or projected payments on the asset  obligations. For purposes of the relationship test, any payment  arrangement, including a swap or other hedge, that achieves a  substantially similar result is treated as satisfying the test. For  example, any arrangement where the timing and amount of payments on  liability obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets  (or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment  experience similar to that of the asset obligations is treated as  satisfying the relationship test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(A)(iii)</em> and this section, payments on asset obligations  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A payment of principal or interest on an asset obligation,  including a prepayment of principal, a payment under a credit  enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this  section) and a payment from a settlement at a discount (other than a  substantial discount);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A payment from a settlement at a substantial discount, but only  if the settlement is arranged, whether in writing or otherwise, prior to  the issuance of the liability obligations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A payment from the foreclosure on or sale of an asset  obligation, but only if the foreclosure or sale is arranged, whether in  writing or otherwise, prior to the issuance of the liability  obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor for entities formed to liquidate assets. Payments on  liability obligations of an entity do not bear a relationship to  payments on asset obligations of the entity if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The entity's organizational documents manifest clearly that the  entity is formed for the primary purpose of liquidating its assets and  distributing proceeds of liquidation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The entity's activities are all reasonably necessary to and  consistent with the accomplishment of liquidating assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The entity plans to satisfy at least 50 percent of the total  issue price of each of its liability obligations having a different  maturity with proceeds from liquidation and not with scheduled payments  on its asset obligations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The terms of the entity's liability obligations (or underlying  arrangement) provide that within three years of the time it first  acquires assets to be liquidated the entity either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Liquidates; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Begins to pass through without delay all payments it receives on  its asset obligations (less reasonable allowances for expenses) as  principal payments on its liability obligations in proportion to the  adjusted issue prices of the liability obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Anti-avoidance rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  determining whether an entity meets the definition of a taxable mortgage  pool, the Commissioner can disregard or make other adjustments to a  transaction (or series of transactions) if the transaction (or series)  is entered into with a view to achieving the same economic effect as  that of an arrangement subject to section 7701(i) while avoiding the  application of that section. The Commissioner's authority includes  treating equity interests issued by a non-REMIC as debt if the entity  issues equity interests that correspond to maturity classes of debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain investment trusts. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of  this section, an ownership interest in an entity that is classified as a  trust under Sec. 301.7701-4(c) will not be treated as a debt obligation  of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (g):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)-1(f))</em>.  Certificate 1 represents the residual beneficial ownership of the FNMA  Certificates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On July 5, 1997, with a view to avoiding the application of  section 7701(i), Partnership P transfers Certificate 1 to Trust 2 in  exchange for 100 Class B bonds and Certificate 2. The Class B bonds,  under which Trust 2 is the obligor, have a stated principal amount of  $5,000,000, bear a relationship to the FNMA Certificates (within the  meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f)), and have a different maturity than  the Class A bonds (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)).  Certificate 2 represents the residual beneficial ownership of  Certificate 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining whether Trust 1 is classified as a  taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can disregard the separate  existence of Trust 2 and treat Trust 1 and Trust 2 as a single trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation Q files a consolidated return with its  two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Corporation R and Corporation S.  Corporation R is in the business of building and selling single family  homes. Corporation S is in the business of financing sales of those  homes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On August 10, 1998, Corporation S transfers a pool of its real  estate mortgages to Trust 3, taking back Certificate 3 which represents  beneficial ownership of the pool. On September 25, 1998, with a view to  avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation R issues bonds  that have different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)- 1(e)) and that bear a relationship (within the meaning of Sec.  301.7701(i)-1(f)) to the real estate mortgages in Trust 3. The holders  of the bonds have an interest in a credit enhancement contract that is  written by Corporation S and collateralized with Certificate 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining whether Trust 3 is classified as a  taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat Trust 3 as the obligor  of the bonds issued by Corporation R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X, in addition to its other assets, owns  $110,000,000 in Treasury securities. From time to time, Corporation X  acquires pools of real estate mortgages, which it immediately uses to  issue multiple-class debt obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On October 1, 1996, Corporation X transfers $20,000,000 in  Treasury securities to Trust 4 in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D  bonds, Class E bonds, and Certificate 4. Trust 4 is the obligor of the  bonds. The different classes of bonds have the same stated   maturity date, but if cash flows from the Trust 4 assets exceed the  amounts needed to make interest payments, the trustee uses the excess to  retire the classes of bonds in alphabetical order. Certificate 4  represents the residual beneficial ownership of the Treasury securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i),  Corporation X reserves the right to replace any Trust 4 asset with real  estate mortgages or guaranteed mortgage pass-through certificates. In  the event the right is exercised, cash flows on the real estate  mortgages and guaranteed pass-through certificates will be used in the  same manner as cash flows on the Treasury securities. Corporation X  exercises this right of replacement on February 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of determining whether Trust 4 is classified as a  taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat February 1, 1997, as a  testing day (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). The  result is the same if Corporation X has an obligation, rather than a  right, to replace the Trust 4 assets with real estate mortgages and  guaranteed pass-through certificates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation Y, in addition to its other assets, owns  $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property. On November 1,  1995, Corporation Y begins negotiating a $2,000,000 loan to individual  A. As security for the loan, A offers a first deed of trust on land  worth $1,700,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i),  Corporation Y induces A to place the land in a partnership in which A  will have a 95 percent interest and agrees to accept the partnership  interest as security for the $2,000,000 loan. Thereafter, the loan to A,  together with the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal  property, are transferred to Trust 5 and used to issue bonds that have  different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and  that bear a relationship (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f))  to the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property and the  loan to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining whether Trust 5 is a taxable  mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the loan to A as an obligation  secured by an interest in real property rather than as an obligation  secured by an interest in a partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation Z, in addition to its other assets, owns  $3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping centers.  Partnership L, in addition to its other assets, owns $20,000,000 in  notes that are principally secured by interests in single family homes  and $3,500,000 in notes that are principally secured by interests in  personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 1, 1995, Partnership L asks Corporation Z for two  separate loans, one in the amount of $9,375,000 and another in the  amount of $625,000. Partnership L offers to collateralize the $9,375,000  loan with $10,312,500 of notes secured by interests in single family  homes and the $625,000 loan with $750,000 of notes secured by interests  in personal property. Corporation Z has made similar loans to  Partnership L in the past.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i),  Corporation Z induces Partnership L to accept a single $10,000,000 loan  and to post as collateral $7,500,000 of the notes secured by interests  in single family homes and all $3,500,000 of the notes secured by  interests in personal property. Ordinarily, Corporation Z would not make  a loan on these terms. Thereafter, the loan to Partnership L, together  with the $3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping  centers, are transferred to Trust 6 and used to issue bonds that have  different maturities (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and  that bear a relationship (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(f))  to the loans secured by interests in retail shopping centers and the  loan to Partnership L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of determining whether Trust 6 is a taxable  mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the $10,000,000 loan to  Partnership L as consisting of a $9,375,000 obligation secured by  interests in real property and a $625,000 obligation secured by  interests in personal property. Under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(ii)(A),  the notes secured by single family homes are treated as $7,500,000 of  interests in real property. Under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(i)(A),  $7,500,000 of interests in real property are sufficient to treat a  $9,375,000 obligation as principally secured by an interest in real  property ($7,500,000 equals 80 percent of $9,375,000).  [T.D. 8610, 60 FR 40088, Aug. 7, 1995; 60 FR 49754, Sept. 27, 1995]    Sec. 301.7701(i)-2  Special rules for portions of entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Portion defined. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section and Sec. 301.7701(i)-1, a portion of an entity includes all  assets that support one or more of the same issues of debt obligations.  For this purpose, an asset supports a debt obligation if, under the  terms of the debt obligation (or underlying arrangement), the timing and  amount of payments on the debt obligation are in large part determined,  either directly or indirectly, by the timing and amount of payments or  projected payments on the asset or a group of assets that includes the  asset. Indirect payment arrangements include, for example, a swap or  other hedge, or arrangements where the timing and amount of payments on  the   debt obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets (or an  index or other type of model) that has an expected payment experience  similar to that of the assets. For purposes of this paragraph, the term  payments includes all proceeds and receipts from an asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain assets and rights to assets disregarded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit  enhancement assets. An asset that qualifies as a credit enhancement  contract (as defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)) is not included  in a portion as a separate asset, but is treated as part of the assets  in the portion to which it relates under Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(i).  An asset that does not qualify as a credit enhancement contract (as  defined in Sec. 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)), but that nevertheless serves  the same function as a credit enhancement contract, is not included in a  portion as a separate asset or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assets unlikely to service obligations. A portion does not  include assets that are unlikely to produce any significant cash flows  for the holders of the debt obligations. This paragraph applies even if  the holders of the debt obligations are legally entitled to cash flows  from the assets. Thus, for example, even if the sale of a building would  cause a series of debt obligations to be redeemed, the building is not  included in a portion if it is not likely to be sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recourse. An asset is not included in a portion solely because  the holders of the debt obligations have recourse to the holder of that  asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Portion as obligor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section  7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), a portion of an entity is treated as the obligor of  all debt obligations supported by the assets in that portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation Z owns $1,000,000,000 in assets including  an office complex and $90,000,000 of real estate mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On November 30, 1998, Corporation Z issues eight classes of  bonds, Class A through Class H. Each class is secured by a separate  letter of credit and by a lien on the office complex. One group of the  real estate mortgages supports Class A through Class D, another group  supports Class E through Class G, and a third group supports Class H. It  is anticipated that the cash flows from each group of mortgages will  service its related bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each of the following constitutes a separate portion of  Corporation Z: the group of mortgages supporting Class A through Class  D; the group of mortgages supporting Class E through Class G; and the  group of mortgages supporting Class H. No other asset is included in any  of the three portions notwithstanding the lien of the bonds on the  office complex and the fact that Corporation Z is the issuer of the  bonds. The letters of credit are treated as incidents of the mortgages  to which they relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), each portion  described above is treated as the obligor of the bonds of that portion,  notwithstanding the fact that Corporation Z is the legal obligor with  respect to the bonds.
