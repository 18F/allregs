                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the general design and the safety features, MSHA considers that a lamp of permissible type should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to performance, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time of burning and candlepower. Permissible electric cap lamps shall burn for at least 10 consecutive hours on one charge of the battery and shall give during that period a mean candlepower of light beam of not less than 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bulb life. The average life of the bulbs shall be not less than 200 hours, and at least 92 percent of the bulbs shall have a life of 150 hours. The life of a bulb is the number of hours its main filament will burn in the cap lamp or its equivalent.</p><p class="depth2">The life of a bulb having main filaments in parallel is considered ended when the first filament ceases to burn; the life of a bulb having independent main filament is considered ended when the last filament ceases to burn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bulb uniformity. (1) The bulbs submitted shall meet the following minimum requirements for variation in current consumption and candlepower:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bulbs submitted shall meet the following minimum requirements for variation in current consumption and candlepower:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The current consumption of at least 94 percent of the bulbs shall not exceed the average current by more than 6 percent. The candlepower (s. cp.) of at least 90 percent of the bulbs shall not fall short of the average candlepower by more than 30 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Corrosion of contacts. Battery terminals and leads therefrom, as well as the battery gas vents, shall be designed to minimize corrosion of the electrical contacts.
