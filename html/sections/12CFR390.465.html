                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Core Capital. (1) The following elements,\1\ less the amount of any deductions pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, comprise a State savings association' s core capital:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Stock issues where the dividend is reset periodically based on current market conditions and the State savings association's current credit rating, including but not limited to, auction rate, money market or remarketable preferred stock, are assigned to supplementary capital, regardless of cumulative or noncumulative characteristics.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus; \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Stock issued by subsidiaries that may not be counted by the parent State savings association on the Thrift Financial Report or Consolidated Reports of Condition or Income (``Call Report''), as applicable, likewise shall not be considered in calculating capital. For example, preferred stock issued by a State savings association or a subsidiary that is, in effect, collateralized by assets of the State savings association or one of its subsidiaries shall not be included in capital. Similarly, common stock with mandatorily redeemable provisions is not includable in core capital.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minority interests in the equity accounts of the subsidiaries that are fully consolidated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual State savings associations (excluding any treasury shares held by the State savings association) meeting the criteria of regulations and memoranda of the FDIC to the extent that such accounts or deposits have no fixed maturity date, cannot be withdrawn at the option of the accountholder, and do not earn interest that carries over to subsequent periods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deductions from core capital. (i) Intangible assets, as defined in Sec. 390.461, are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 390.471.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Servicing assets that are not includable in core capital pursuant to Sec. 390.471 are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Credit-enhancing interest-only strips that are not includable in core capital under Sec. 390.471 are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Investments, both equity and debt, in subsidiaries that are not includable subsidiaries (including those subsidiaries where the State savings association has a minority ownership interest) are deducted from assets and, thus core capital except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(v) and (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If a State savings association has any investments (both debt and equity) in one or more subsidiaries engaged in any activity that would not fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries may engage, it must deduct such investments from assets and, thus, core capital in accordance with this paragraph (a)(2)(v). The State savings association must first deduct from assets and, thus, core capital the amount by which any investments in such subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such investments held by the State savings association as of April 12, 1989. Next the State savings association must deduct from assets and, thus, core capital, the State savings association's investments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which the State savings association's capital is being determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If a State savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, the FDIC may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount of core capital that would be required would be higher if the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the parent State savings association than the amount that would be

required if the parent State savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent State savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent State savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in Sec. 390.461.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Deferred tax assets that are not includable in core capital pursuant to Sec. 390.471 are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Supplementary Capital. Supplementary capital counts towards a State savings association's total capital up to a maximum of 100% of the State savings association's core capital. The following elements comprise a State savings association's supplementary capital:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Permanent Capital Instruments. (i) Cumulative perpetual preferred stock and other perpetual preferred stock \3\ issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Preferred stock issued by subsidiaries that may not be counted by the parent State savings association on the Thrift Financial Report or Consolidated Reports of Condition or Income (``Call Report''), as applicable, likewise may not be considered in calculating capital. Preferred stock issued by a State savings association or a subsidiary that is, in effect, collateralized by assets of the State savings association or one of its subsidiaries may not be included in capital.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits (excluding any treasury shares held by the State savings association) meeting the criteria of 12 CFR 390.307 to the extent that such instruments are not included in core capital under paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Perpetual subordinated debt issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (capital notes) issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maturing Capital Instruments. (i) Subordinated debt issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Intermediate-term preferred stock issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC and any related surplus:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (commitment notes) issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the FDIC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that was issued before July 23, 1985 or issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Office of Thrift Supervision and approved in writing by the FSLIC for inclusion as regulatory capital before or after issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition rules for maturing capital instruments--A State savings association may include maturing capital instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989, in supplementary capital in accordance with the treatment set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the maturing capital instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included as supplementary capital is reduced by 20% of the original amount of that instrument (net of redemptions).\4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Capital instruments may be redeemed prior to maturity and without the prior approval of the FDIC, as long as the instruments are redeemed with the proceeds of, or replaced by, a like amount of a similar or higher quality capital instrument. However, the FDIC must be notified in writing at least 30 days in advance of such redemption.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only the aggregate amount of maturing capital instruments that mature in any one year during the seven years immediately prior to an instrument's maturity that does not exceed 20% of an institution's capital will qualify as supplementary capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Once a State savings association selects either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section for the issuance of a maturing capital instrument, it must continue to elect that option for all subsequent issuances of maturing capital instruments for as long as there is a balance outstanding of such post-November 7, 1989, issuances. Only when such issuances have all been repaid and the State savings association has no balance of such issuances outstanding

may the State savings association elect the other option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allowance for loan and lease losses. Allowance for loan and lease losses established under FDIC regulations and memoranda to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets.\5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ The amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that may be included in capital is based on a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The gross sum of risk-weighted assets used in this calculation includes all risk-weighted assets, with the exception of assets required to be deducted under Sec. 390.466 in establishing risk-weighted assets. ``Excess reserves for loan and lease losses'' is defined as assets required to be deducted from capital under Sec. 390.465(a)(2). A State savings association may deduct excess reserves for loan and lease losses from the gross sum of risk-weighted assets (i.e., risk-weighted assets including allowance for loan and lease losses) in computing the denominator of the risk-based capital standard. Thus, a State savings association will exclude the same amount of excess allowance for loan and lease losses from both the numerator and the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unrealized gains on equity securities. Up to 45 percent of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values may be included in supplementary capital. Unrealized gains are unrealized holding gains, net of unrealized holding losses, before income taxes, calculated as the amount, if any, by which fair value exceeds historical cost. The FDIC may disallow such inclusion in the calculation of supplementary capital if the FDIC determines that the equity securities are not prudently valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Total capital. (1) A State savings association's total capital equals the sum of its core capital and supplementary capital (to the extent that such supplementary capital does not exceed 100% of its core capital).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following assets, in addition to assets required to be deducted elsewhere in calculating core capital, are deducted from assets for purposes of determining total capital:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All equity investments.</p>
