                                Sec.  1.57-4  Limitation on amounts treated as items of tax preference
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (and Sec.  1.57-1) is to be limited as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation. The sum of the items of tax preference, for purposes  of section 56(a)(1) and Sec.  1.56A-1(a), is limited to an amount  determined under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loss year. If the taxpayer has no taxable income for the taxable  year without regard to the net operating loss deduction, the amount of  the limitation is equal to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In cases where the taxpayer does not have a net operating loss  for the taxable year, the amount of the recomputed income (as defined in  paragraph (c) of this section) or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where the taxpayer has a net operating loss for the  taxable year, the amount of the net operating loss (expressed as a  positive amount) increased by the recomputed income or decreased by the  recomputed loss for the taxable year (as defined in paragraph (c) of  this section,  plus the amount of the taxpayer's stock option item of tax preference  (as described in Sec.  1.57-1(f)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> in computing the amount of such net  operating loss which may be carried to succeeding taxable years, the  amount of the limitation is equal to the amount, if any, by which the  sum of the items of tax preference (computed with regard to subparagraph  (1)(i) of this paragraph) exceeds the lesser of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount by which such loss is reduced because of a  disallowance of the capital gains deduction in such taxable year, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The capital gains deduction.  The amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be  increased by the amount, if any, that such reduction is attributable to  that portion of such a net operating loss described in section  56(b)(1)(B) and Sec.  1.56A-2(a)(2) (relating to excess tax  preferences).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recomputed income or loss. For purposes of this section, the  phrase ``recomputed income or loss'' means the taxable income or net  operating loss for the taxable year computed without regard to the  amounts described in Sec.  1.57-1 except paragraph (i)(2) of that  section (relating to corporate capital gains) and without regard to the  net operating loss deduction. For this purpose, the reference to the  amounts described in Sec.  1.57-1 is a reference to that portion of the  deduction allowable in computing taxable income under the appropriate  section equal to the amount which is determined in each paragraph of  Sec.  1.57-1. For example, the amount described in Sec.  1.57-1(h)  (relating to excess of percentage depletion over basis) is that portion  of the deduction allowable for depletion under section 611 which is  equal to the amount determined under Sec.  1.57-1(h). For purposes of  this paragraph, the amount described in Sec.  1.57-1(i)(1) (relating to  capital gains) is to be considered as the amount of the deduction  allowable for the taxable year under section 1202.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, pro rata. The balance of the reduction, if  any, is considered to be from the remaining items of tax preference, pro  rata. For purposes of this subparagraph, deductions not attributable to  the taxpayer's trade or business which do not relate to items of tax  preference are considered as being applied in reducing gross income not  derived from such trade or business before such deductions which do  relate to items of tax preferences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples in each of which the deduction for the personal  exemption is disregarded and the taxpayer is an individual who is a  calendar year taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The taxpayer has the following items of income and  deduction for 1970:  Gross income (all business income)..........................    $120,000 Deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Nonbusiness deductions....................................      30,000</p><p class="depth2">Items of tax preference (excess accelerated depreciation        80,000</p><p class="depth2">on real property held in taxpayer's business)............</p><p class="depth2">Other business deductions.................................      50,000</p><p class="depth2">Based on the above figures, the taxpayer has a net operating loss of  $10,000 (business deductions of $130,000 less business income of  $120,000, the nonbusiness deductions having been disallowed by reason of  section 172(d)(4)). The limitation on the amount treated as items of tax  preference is computed as follows:  Tax preferences..............................................    $80,000</p><p class="depth2">============ Net operating loss................................    $10,000 Recomputed income or loss:</p><p class="depth2">Gross income.........................   $120,000</p><p class="depth2">Deductions other than tax preference      80,000</p><p class="depth2">items...............................</p><p class="depth2">------------ Recomputed income.................................     40,000</p><p class="depth2">------------ Sum of net operating loss and recomputed income...     50,000 Stock options preference..........................          0</p><p class="depth2">------------ Limitation........................................     50,000</p><p class="depth2">Thus, the minimum tax computed under section 56(a) would be 10 percent  of $20,000 (items of tax preference of $50,000 less the minimum tax  exemption of $30,000), $1,000 of which would be deferred tax liability  pursuant to section 56(b).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the  other business deductions are $130,000, resulting in a net operating  loss of $90,000. The limitation on the amount treated as items of tax  preference is computed as follows:  Tax preferences..............................................    $80,000</p><p class="depth2">============ Net operating loss................................    $90,000 Recomputed income or loss:</p><p class="depth2">Gross income.........................   $120,000</p><p class="depth2">Deductions other than tax preference     160,000</p><p class="depth2">items...............................</p><p class="depth2">------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(40,000)</em> Disallowance of nonbusiness deductions      30,000</p><p class="depth2">under sec. 172(d).....................</p><p class="depth2">----------- Recomputed loss...................................     10,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Net operating loss less recomputed loss...........     80,000 Stock options preference..........................          0</p><p class="depth2">----------- Limitation...................................................     80,000</p><p class="depth2">Thus, the minimum tax computed under section 56(a) would be 10 percent  of $50,000 (items of tax preference of $80,000 less the minimum tax  exemption of $30,000), all of which will be deferred tax liability  pursuant to section 56(b).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The taxpayer has the following items of income and  deduction for 1970:  Gross income (all from business): Ordinary.....................................................    $50,000</p><p class="depth2">Net section 1201 gains.....................................    120,000 Deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Items of tax preference:</p><p class="depth2">Excess amortization of certified pollution        $45,000</p><p class="depth2">control facilities...........................</p><p class="depth2">Capital gains deduction.......................     60,000    105,000</p><p class="depth2">-----------</p><p class="depth2">Other business deductions............  .........  .........     75,000</p><p class="depth2">In addition, the taxpayer has a $55,000 item of tax preference resulting  from qualified stock options. Based on the above figures, the taxpayer  has no taxable income and no net operating loss as the capital gains  deduction is disallowed in determining the net operating loss pursuant  to section 172(d). The limitation on the amount treated as items of tax  preference is computed as follows:    Tax preferences..............................................   $160,000</p><p class="depth2">============ Net operating loss................................          0 Recomputed income or loss:</p><p class="depth2">Gross income.........................   $170,000</p><p class="depth2">Deductions other than tax preference      75,000</p><p class="depth2">items...............................</p><p class="depth2">------------ Recomputed income.................................    $95,000</p><p class="depth2">Plus: Stock options preference..................     55,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Limitation...................................................    150,000</p><p class="depth2">Thus, the minimum tax computed under section 56 would be 10 percent of  $120,000 (items of tax preference of $150,000 less the minimum tax  exemption of $30,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that the  taxpayer has a net operating loss carryover from 1969 of $80,000. The  taxpayer has $160,000 of tax preferences which are limited to $150,000  pursuant to Sec.  1.57-4(b)(1). In order to determine the amount of the  1969 net operating loss which remains as a carryover to 1971, the 1970  taxable income is redetermined in accordance with section 172(b)(2) and  the regulations thereunder, as follows:  Gross income--1970..............................    $170,000 Deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Capital gains deduction disallowed business       $120,000     120,000</p><p class="depth2">deductions...................................</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------</p><p class="depth2">Taxable income for section 172(b)(2)....................      50,000</p><p class="depth2">Thus, the 1969 net operating loss which remains as a carryover to 1971  is $30,000. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the limitation  on the amount treated as items of tax preference is computed as follows:  Items of tax preference computed with regard to Sec.   1.57-    $150,000</p><p class="depth2">4(b)(1) (per example (3))..................................

In 1973, the taxpayer has a net  operating loss of $60,000 (no portion of which is attributable to excess  tax preferences pursuant to Sec.  1.56A-2) which is carried back to 1970  resulting in no taxable income in 1970. In order to determine the amount  of the 1973 net operating loss which remains as a carryover to 1971, the  1970 taxable income is redetermined, in accordance with section  172(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder, as follows:  Gross income.................................................    $90,000 Deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Capital gains deduction disallowed..............</p><p class="depth2">Medical expenses ($4,100 actually paid but           $1,400</p><p class="depth2">allowable only to the extent in excess of 3</p><p class="depth2">percent of adjusted gross income of $90,000)...</p><p class="depth2">Other itemized deductions.......................     40,000</p><p class="depth2">------------</p><p class="depth2">.........    $41,400</p><p class="depth2">Taxable income for section 172(b)(2)..........  .........     48,600</p><p class="depth2">The limitation on the amount treated as items of tax preference is  computed as follows:  Items of tax preference:</p><p class="depth2">Capital gains.................................  ..........     $20,000</p><p class="depth2">Stock options.................................  ..........      35,000</p><p class="depth2">-----------</p><p class="depth2">..........      55,000 Less:</p><p class="depth2">Lesser of capital gains deduction ($20,000) or amount of      (20,000)</p><p class="depth2">reduction in carryover due to its disallowance ($20,600).</p><p class="depth2">-------------</p><p class="depth2">Limitation..............................................      35,000</p><p class="depth2">Thus, the minimum tax for 1970 under section 56 would be 10 percent of  $5,000 (items of tax preference of $35,000 less the minimum tax  exemption of $30,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example (5) except that the  1973 net operating loss was $45,000.
