The requirements of this paragraph shall be  applicable to one unit at the Navajo Generating Station beginning  November 19, 1997, to two units beginning November 19, 1998, and to all  units beginning on August 19, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Schedule of compliance. The owner or operator shall take the  following actions by the dates specified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By June 1, 1992, award binding contracts to an architectural and  engineering firm to design and procure the control system needed for  compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By January 1, 1995, initiate on-site construction or  installation of a control system for the first unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> By May 1, 1997, initiate start-up testing of the control  system for the first unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> By May 1, 1998, initiate start-up testing of the control system  for the second unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> By February 1, 1999, initiate start-up testing of the control  system for the third unit.  The interim deadlines will be extended if the owner or operators can  demonstrate to the Administrator that compliance with the deadlines in  paragraph (d)(6) of this section will not be affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Reporting on compliance schedule. Within 30 days after the  specified date for each deadline in the schedule of compliance  (paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify  the Administrator in writing whether the deadline was met. If it was not  met the notice shall include an explanation why it was not met and the  steps which shall be taken to ensure future deadlines will be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Exclusion for equipment failure during initial operation. For  each unit, in determining compliance for the first year that such unit  is required to meet the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, periods during which one of the following conditions are met  shall be excluded:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equipment or systems do not meet designer's or manufacturer's  performance expectations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Field installation including engineering or construction  precludes equipment or systems from performing as designed.  The periods to be excluded shall be determined by the Administrator  based on the periodic reports of compliance with the emission limitation  in paragraph (d)(2) of this section which shall identify the times  proposed for exclusion and provide the reasons for the exclusion,  including the reasons for the control system outage. The report also  shall describe the actions taken to avoid the outage, to minimize its  duration, and to reduce SO2 emissions at the plant to the  extent practicable   while the control system was not fully operational. Whenever the time to  be excluded exceeds a cumulative total of 30 days for any control system  for any affected unit, the owner or operators shall submit a report  within 15 days addressing the history of and prognosis for the  performance of the control system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Exclusion for catastrophic failure. In addition to the  exclusion of periods allowed in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, any  periods of emissions from an affected unit for which the Administrator  finds that the control equipment or system for such unit is out of  service because of catastrophic failure of the control system which  occurred for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operators and  could not have been prevented by good engineering practices will be  excluded from the compliance determination. Events which are the  consequence of lack of appropriate maintenance or of intentional or  negligent conduct or omissions of the owner or operators or the control  system design, construction, or operating contractors do not constitute  catastrophic failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Equipment operation. The owner or operator shall optimally  operate all equipment or systems needed to comply with the requirements  of this paragraph consistent with good engineering practices to keep  emissions at or below the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of  this section, and following outages of any control equipment or systems  the control equipment or system will be returned to full operation as  expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Maintenance scheduling. On March 16 of each year starting in  1993, the owner or operator shall prepare and submit to the  Administrator a long-term maintenance plan for the Navajo Generating  Station which accommodates the maintenance requirements for the other  generating facilities on the Navajo Generating Station grid covering the  period from March 16 to March 15 of the next year and showing at least 6  unit-weeks of maintenance for the Navajo Generating Station during the  November 1 to March 15 period, except as provided in paragraph (d)(13)  of this section. This plan shall be developed consistent with the  criteria established by the Western States Coordinating Council of the  North American Electric Reliability Council to ensure an adequate  reserve margin of electric generating capacity. At the time that a plan  is transmitted to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall notify  the Administrator in writing if less than the full scheduled unit-weeks  of maintenance were conducted for the period covered by the previous  plan and shall furnish a written report stating how that year qualified  for one of the exceptions identified in paragraph (d)(13) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Exceptions for maintenance scheduling. The owner or operator  shall conduct a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance in accordance with the  plan required in paragraph (d)(12) of this section unless the owner or  operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a  full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance during the November 1 to March 15  period should not be required because of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There is no need for 6 unit-weeks of scheduled periodic  maintenance in the year covered by the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reserve margin on any electrical system served by the  Navajo Generating Station would fall to an inadequate level, as defined  by the criteria referred to in paragraph (d)(12) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost of compliance with this requirement would be  excessive. The cost of compliance would be excessive when the economic  savings to the owner or operator of moving maintenance out of the  November 1 to March 15 period exceeds $50,000 per unit-day of  maintenance moved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A major forced outage at a unit occurs outside of the November  1 to March 15 period, and necessary periodic maintenance occurs during  the period of forced outage.  If the Administrator determines that a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance  during the November 1 to March 15 period should not be required, the  owner or operator shall nevertheless conduct that amount of scheduled  maintenance that is not precluded by the Administrator. Generally, the  owner or operator shall make best efforts to conduct as much scheduled  maintenance as   practicable during the November 1 to March 15 period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Approval.

The owner/operator shall test, at a minimum, for the  ammonia injection system at molar ratios of 0.75, 1.0, and 1.20. If data  collected at the highest molar ratio indicates decreasing lb/ton  emissions, the owner/operator shall continue to test the ammonia  injection system by increasing the molar ratio by increments of 0.10  until either the lb/ton emission data indicates no significant decrease  from the previous increment, or adverse effects are observed (e.g.,  ammonia slip emissions above 10 ppm, presence of a secondary particulate  plume, impaired product, impaired kiln operations).</p><p class="depth0">e.

As part of the Optimization Protocol, the owner/operator shall  submit to EPA a schedule for optimizing each the ammonia injection  system parameters identified in Item 10 of this appendix. The schedule  shall indicate the total duration of the Optimization period, and must  optimize each identified parameter for the following minimum amounts of  time:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum</p><p class="depth0">optimization</p><p class="depth0">Parameter                             period</p><p class="depth0">(operating</p><p class="depth0">days) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fuel usage between riser duct burner and calciner                     15</p><p class="depth0">burners................................................

Within 60 days following the termination of the Optimization  Period(s), the owner/operator shall submit to EPA for review an  Optimization Report demonstrating conformance with the Optimization  Protocol for the ammonia injection system and establishing the optimized  operating parameters   for the facility processes and the ammonia injection system determined  under the Optimization Protocol, including optimized injection rates for  all reagents. The owner/operator may take into account energy,  environmental, and economic impacts and other costs in proposing the  optimized state of the ammonia injection system, including the injection  rates of reagents, and the operating parameters for the facility  processes. The owner/operator may also include in the Optimization  Report a discussion of any problems encountered during the Optimization  Period, and how that problem may impact the potential emission  reductions (e.g. the quantity of reagent slip at varying injection rates  and/or the possible observance of a detached plume above the Stack).</p><p class="depth0">13. Optimization Targets: Except as otherwise provided in this Item  and in Item 14 of this appendix, the ammonia injection system shall be  deemed to be optimized if the Optimization Report demonstrates that the  ammonia injection system during periods of normal operation has achieved  emission reductions consistent with its maximum design stoichiometric  rate identified in the Design Report.</p><p class="depth0">14. Notwithstanding the provisions of Item 13 of this appendix, the  ammonia injection system may be deemed to be optimized at a lower rate  of emission reductions than that identified in Item 13 of this appendix  if the Optimization Report demonstrates that, during periods of normal  operation, a lower rate of emission reductions cannot be sustained after  all parameters and injection rates are optimized during the Optimization  Period without creating a meaningful risk of impairing product quality,  impairing Kiln system reliability, impairing compliance with a maximum  ammonia slip emissions limit of 10 ppm or other permitted levels, or  forming a detached plume.</p><p class="depth0">15. During the Optimization Period, the owner/operator, to the  extent practicable and applicable, shall operate the ammonia injection  system in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice  consistent with 40 CFR 60.11(d). The owner/operator will adjust its  optimization of the ammonia injection system as may be necessary to  avoid, mitigate or abate an identifiable non-compliance with an emission  limitation or standard for pollutants other than NOx. In the event the  owner/operator determines, prior to the expiration of the Optimization  Period, that its ability to optimize the ammonia injection system will  be affected by potential impairments to product quality, kiln system  reliability or increased emissions of other pollutants, then the owner/ operator shall promptly advise EPA of this determination, and include  these considerations as part of its recommendation in its Optimization  Report.</p><p class="depth0">V. Demonstration Period</p><p class="depth0">16. The Demonstration Period shall commence within 7 days after the  owner/operator's receipt of final comments from EPA on the Optimization  Report. During the Demonstration Period, the owner/operator shall  operate the ammonia injection system for a period of 270 Operating Days  consistent with the optimized operations of the Facility and the ammonia  injection system as contained in the Optimization Report. This 270  Operating Day Demonstration Period may be shortened or lengthened as  provided for in Items 17 and 18 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">17. If Kiln Operation is disrupted by excessive unplanned outages,  or excessive Startups and Shutdowns during the Demonstration Period, or  if the Kiln temporarily ceases operation for business or technical  reasons, the owner/operator may advise EPA that it is necessary to  temporarily extend the Demonstration Period. Data gathered during  periods of disruption may not be used to determine an emission  limitation.</p><p class="depth0">18. If evidence arises during the Demonstration Period that product  quality, kiln system reliability, or emission compliance with an  emission limitation or standard is impaired by reason of longer term  operation of the ammonia injection system in a manner consistent with  the parameters identified in the Optimization Report, then the owner/ operator may, upon notice to EPA, temporarily modify the manner of  operation of the facility process or the ammonia injection system to  mitigate the effects and, if necessary, notify EPA that the owner/ operator will suspend or extend the Demonstration Period for further  technical evaluation of the effects of a process optimization or  permanently modify the manner of operation of the ammonia injection  system to mitigate the effects.</p><p class="depth0">19. During the Demonstration Period, the owner/operator shall  collect the same data as required in Item 8 of this appendix. The  Demonstration Report shall include the data collected as required in  this Item.</p><p class="depth0">20. Within 60 Days following completion of the Demonstration Period  for the ammonia injection system, the owner/operator shall submit a  Demonstration Report to EPA, based upon and including all of the data  collected during the Demonstration Period including data from Startup,  Shutdown and Malfunction events, that identifies a proposed 30-kiln  operating day emission limit for NOX. The 30-kiln operating  day emission limit for NOX shall be based upon an analysis of  CEMS data and clinker production data collected during the Demonstration  Period, while the process and ammonia injection system parameters were  optimized in determining the proposed final Emission Limit(s) achievable  for the Facility. Total pounds of   an affected pollutant emitted during an individual Operating Day will be  calculated from collected CEMS data for that Day. Hours or Days when  there is no Kiln Operation may be excluded from the analyses. However,  the owner/operator shall provide an explanation in the Demonstration  Report(s) for any data excluded from the analyses. In any event, the  owner/operator shall include all data required to be collected during  the Demonstration Period in the Final Demonstration Report(s).</p><p class="depth0">21. The owner/operator shall propose a 30-kiln operating day  emission limit for NOx in the Demonstration Report(s) as provided in  Item 20 of this appendix. This 30-kiln operating day emission limit  shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:  X = [micro] + 1.65[sigma]  Where:  X = 30-Day Rolling Average Emission Limit (lb/Ton of clinker); [micro] = arithmetic mean of all of the 30-Day rolling averages; [sigma] = standard deviation of all of the 30-Day rolling averages, as</p><p class="depth0">calculated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03SE14.004</p><p class="depth0">Where:  N = The total number of rolling 30-kiln operating day emission rates;  xi = Each rolling 30-kiln operating day emission rate; x = The mean value of all of the rolling 30-kiln operating day emission</p><p class="depth0">rates.</p><p class="depth0">22. Supporting data required to be submitted under this appendix may  contain information relative to kiln operation and production that the  owner/operator may consider to be proprietary. In such a situation, the  owner/operator may submit the information to EPA as CBI, subject to the  provisions of 40 CFR part 2.
