                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Except for purposes of determining whether goods originate in Israel or are the growth, product, or manufacture of Israel, and except as otherwise provided for by statute, the provisions of this section will control the determination of the country of origin of imported textile and apparel products for purposes of the Customs laws and the administration of quantitative restrictions. The provisions of this section will apply to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following terms will have the meanings indicated when used in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Country of origin. The term country of origin means the country, territory, or insular possession in which a good originates or of which a good is the growth, product, or manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fabric-making process. A fabric-making process is any manufacturing operation that begins with polymers, fibers, filaments (including strips), yarns, twine, cordage, rope, or fabric strips and results in a textile fabric.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Knit to shape. The term knit to shape applies to any good of which 50 percent or more of the exterior surface area is formed by major parts that have been knitted or crocheted directly to the shape used in the good, with no consideration being given to patch pockets, appliques, or the like. Minor cutting, trimming, or sewing of those major parts will not affect the determination of whether a good is ``knit to shape.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Major parts. The term major parts means integral components of a good but does not include collars, cuffs, waistbands, plackets, pockets, linings, paddings, trim, accessories, or similar parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Textile or apparel product. A textile or apparel product is any good classifiable in Chapters 50 through 63, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and any good classifiable under one of the following HTSUS headings or subheadings:
3005.903921.12.153921.13.153921.90.25504202.12.40-804202.22.40-804202.32.40-954202.92.04-084202.92.15-304202.92.60-906405.20.606406.10.776406.10.906406.99.156501650265046505.906601.10-997019.19.157019.19.287019.40-598708.2188049113.90.409404.909612.10.9010</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Wholly assembled. The term ``wholly assembled'' when used with reference to a good means that all components, of which there must be at least two, preexisted in essentially the same condition as found in the finished good and were combined to form the finished good in a single country, territory, or insular possession. Minor attachments and minor embellishments

(for example, appliques, beads, spangles, embroidery, buttons) not appreciably affecting the identity of the good, and minor subassemblies (for example, collars, cuffs, plackets, pockets), will not affect the status of a good as ``wholly assembled'' in a single country, territory, or insular possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General rules. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the country of origin of a textile or apparel product will be determined by sequential application of paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section and, in each case where appropriate to the specific context, by application of the additional requirements or conditions of Sec. Sec. 102.12 through 102.19 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The country of origin of a textile or apparel product is the single country, territory, or insular possession in which the good was wholly obtained or produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the country of origin of a textile or apparel product cannot be determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the country of origin of the good is the single country, territory, or insular possession in which each foreign material incorporated in that good underwent an applicable change in tariff classification, and/or met any other requirement, specified for the good in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the country of origin of a textile or apparel product cannot be determined under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the good was knit to shape, the country of origin of the good is the single country, territory, or insular possession in which the good was knit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except for fabrics of chapter 59 and goods of heading 5609, 5807, 5811, 6213, 6214, 6301 through 6306, and 6308, and subheadings 6209.20.5040, 6307.10, 6307.90, and 9404.90, if the good was not knit to shape and the good was wholly assembled in a single country, territory, or insular possession, the country of origin of the good is the country, territory, or insular possession in which the good was wholly assembled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the country of origin of a textile or apparel product cannot be determined under paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the country of origin of the good is the single country, territory, or insular possession in which the most important assembly or manufacturing process occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the country of origin of a textile or apparel product cannot be determined under paragraph (c) (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section, the country of origin of the good is the last country, territory, or insular possession in which an important assembly or manufacturing process occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of sets. Where a good classifiable in the HTSUS as a set includes one or more components that are textile or apparel products and a single country of origin for all of the components of the set cannot be determined under paragraph (c) of this section, the country of origin of each component of the set that is a textile or apparel product will be determined separately under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Specific rules by tariff classification. (1) The following rules will apply for purposes of determining the country of origin of a textile or apparel product under paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
