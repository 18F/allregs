                            <p class="depth0">For power reactor licensees who, before the effective date of this rule, either submitted a decommissioning plan for approval or possess an approved decommissioning plan, the plan is considered to be the PSDAR submittal required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the provisions of this section apply accordingly. For power reactor licensees whose decommissioning plan approval activities have been relegated to notice of opportunity for a hearing under subpart G of 10 CFR part 2, the public meeting convened and 90-day delay of major decommissioning activities required in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(5) of this section shall not apply, and any orders arising from proceedings under subpart G of 10 CFR part 2 shall continue and remain in effect absent any orders from the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For power reactor licensees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> When a licensee has determined to permanently cease operations the licensee shall, within 30 days, submit a written certification to the NRC, consistent with the requirements of Sec. 50.4(b)(8);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a licensee has determined to permanently cease operations the licensee shall, within 30 days, submit a written certification to the NRC, consistent with the requirements of Sec. 50.4(b)(8);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Once fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel, the licensee shall submit a written certification to the NRC that meets the requirements of Sec. 50.4(b)(9) and;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For licensees whose licenses have been permanently modified to allow possession but not operation of the facility, before the effective date of this rule, the certifications required in paragraphs (a)(1) (i)-(ii) of this section shall be deemed to have been submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel, or when a final legally effective order to permanently cease operations has come into effect, the 10 CFR part 50 license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel into the reactor vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decommissioning will be completed within 60 years of permanent cessation of operations. Completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years will be approved by the Commission only when necessary to protect public health and safety. Factors that will be considered by the Commission in evaluating an alternative that provides for completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years of permanent cessation of operations include unavailability of

waste disposal capacity and other site-specific factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out decommissioning, including presence of other nuclear facilities at the site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> Prior to or within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations, the licensee shall submit a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC, and a copy to the affected State(s). The PSDAR must contain a description of the planned decommissioning activities along with a schedule for their accomplishment, a discussion that provides the reasons for concluding that the environmental impacts associated with site-specific decommissioning activities will be bounded by appropriate previously issued environmental impact statements, and a site-specific DCE, including the projected cost of managing irradiated fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to or within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations, the licensee shall submit a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC, and a copy to the affected State(s).

For licensees that have submitted the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) and commencing 90 days after the NRC has received the PSDAR, an additional 20 percent may be used. A site-specific decommissioning cost estimate must be submitted to the NRC prior to the licensee using any funding in excess of these amounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations, if not already submitted, the licensee shall submit a site-specific decommissioning cost estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For decommissioning activities that delay completion of decommissioning by including a period of storage or surveillance, the licensee shall provide a means of adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels over the storage or surveillance period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> After submitting its site-specific DCE required by paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, and until the licensee has completed its final radiation survey

and demonstrated that residual radioactivity has been reduced to a level that permits termination of its license, the licensee must annually submit to the NRC, by March 31, a financial assurance status report. The report must include the following information, current through the end of the previous calendar year:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount spent on decommissioning, both cumulative and over the previous calendar year, the remaining balance of any decommissioning funds, and the amount provided by other financial assurance methods being relied upon;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An estimate of the costs to complete decommissioning, reflecting any difference between actual and estimated costs for work performed during the year, and the decommissioning criteria upon which the estimate is based;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any modifications occurring to a licensee's current method of providing financial assurance since the last submitted report; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any material changes to trust agreements or financial assurance contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the sum of the balance of any remaining decommissioning funds, plus earnings on such funds calculated at not greater than a 2 percent real rate of return, together with the amount provided by other financial assurance methods being relied upon, does not cover the estimated cost to complete the decommissioning, the financial assurance status report must include additional financial assurance to cover the estimated cost of completion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> After submitting its site-specific DCE required by paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the licensee must annually submit to the NRC, by March 31, a report on the status of its funding for managing irradiated fuel. The report must include the following information, current through the end of the previous calendar year:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of funds accumulated to cover the cost of managing the irradiated fuel;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The projected cost of managing irradiated fuel until title to the fuel and possession of the fuel is transferred to the Secretary of Energy; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the funds accumulated do not cover the projected cost, a plan to obtain additional funds to cover the cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> All power reactor licensees must submit an application for termination of license.
