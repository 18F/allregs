                            <p class="depth0">Each service company must keep its accounts and records so as to be  able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all  transactions with associate companies. The statements may be required to  show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved in the  transactions and the amounts included in each account prescribed in this  part with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associate  companies must be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions  of the same nature. Nothing contained in this part, however, must be  construed as restraining the service company from subdividing accounts  for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associate  companies.</p>
