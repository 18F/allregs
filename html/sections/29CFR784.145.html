                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If the operations of separate processors are integrated in producing  canned seafood products all employees of such processors who perform any  part of the described continuous series of operations to accomplish this  result would be ``employed in the canning of'' such products. Moreover,  preliminary operations performed in a separately owned processing  establishment which are directed toward the particular requirements of a  cannery pursuant to some definite arrangement between the operators of  the two establishments would generally appear to be integrated with the  cannery operations within the meaning of the above principles, so that  the employees engaged in the preliminary operations in the separate  establishment would be employed in ``canning'' within the meaning of  section 13(b)(4) of the Act. Whether or not integration exists in a  specific case of this general nature will depend, of course, upon all  the relevant facts and circumstances in such case.    Sec. 784.146  ``Subsequent operations.''</p><p class="depth0">Canning, within the meaning of the exemption, includes operations  performed after hermetic sealing of the cans or other containers, such  as labeling of them and placing of them in cases or boxes, which are  required to place the canned product in the form in which it will be  sold or shipped by the canner. This is so whether or not such operations  immediately follow the actual canning operations as a part of an  uninterrupted process. Storing and shipping operations performed by the  employees of the cannery in connection with its canned products, during  weeks in which canning operations are going on, to make room for the  canned products coming off the line or to make storage room, come within  the exemption. The fact that such activities relate in part to products  canned during the previous weeks or seasons would not affect the  application of the exemption, provided canning operations such as  hermetic sealing and sterilizing, or labeling, are currently being  carried on.</p>
