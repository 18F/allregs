                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy, consistent with DoD Directive 1322.08E,  ``Voluntary Education Programs for Military Personnel'' (available at  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/132208p.pdf), that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Members of the Military Services serving on active duty and  members of the Selected Reserve (SELRES) will be afforded the  opportunity to complete their high school education through a state- funded or Service component sponsored program; earn an equivalency  diploma, improve their academic skills or level of literacy, enroll in  career and technical education schools, receive college credit for  military training and experience in accordance with the American Council  on Education (ACE) Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in  the Armed Services (available at http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/ Military-Guide-Online.aspx), take tests to earn college credit, and  enroll in postsecondary education programs that lead to industry- recognized credentials, and undergraduate and graduate degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service members' costs to participate in the DoD Voluntary  Education Program as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2007, will be reduced  through financial support, including TA that is administered uniformly  across the Military Services. On an annual basis and no later than the  end of the second quarter of the fiscal year, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R;)), in coordination with the  Military Departments, will review the uniform semester-hour (or  equivalent) TA caps and annual TA ceilings to determine possible changes  for the upcoming fiscal year. If there are any changes in the uniform  semester-hour (or equivalent) caps and annual TA ceilings, a memorandum  will be released from the USD(P&R;), in coordination with the Military  Departments, and a corresponding notice will be published in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Professional education counseling will be readily available and  easy to access so that Service members can make informed decisions  concerning available educational opportunities and benefits. Education  counseling will be provided by qualified professional (Education  Services Series 1740 or an individual with equivalent qualifications) in  sufficient numbers to operate   voluntary education programs as determined by individual Service  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 13607:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Educational institutions receiving funding from federal military  educational benefits programs, such as the DoD TA Program, will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide meaningful information to students on the financial cost  and attendance at an educational institution so military students can  make informed decisions on where to attend school as stated in section 3  of Appendix A.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive recruiting practices  that target Service members as defined by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act and as stated in section 3 of  Appendix A.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide academic and student support services specific to the  institutions' programs to all enrolled Service members, spouses and  adult family members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DoD will implement a centralized online complaint system for  Service members, spouses, and adult family members that will register,  track, and respond to student complaints. DoD or the assigned Military  Service will work with educational institutions to resolve any filed  complaints. Educational institutions having recurring, substantive  complaints or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints may  face a range of penalties from a directed Third Party Education  Assessment to revocation of the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU  and removal from participation in the DoD TA Program. As appropriate,  DoD will refer student complaints to other government agencies/ regulators including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission  (FTC), Department of Justice (DOJ), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  (CFPB), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Education  (ED).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Educational institutions accredited by a national or regional  accrediting agency recognized by ED will be encouraged to provide degree  programs on DoD installations and the Military Services will facilitate  their operations on the DoD installations referred to in Sec. 68.6(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To the extent that space is otherwise available, eligible adult  family members of Service members, DoD civilian employees and their  eligible adult family members, and military retirees may enroll in  postsecondary education programs offered on a DoD installation at no  cost to the individual Service TA programs.</p>
