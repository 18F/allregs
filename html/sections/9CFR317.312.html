                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The general principles followed in arriving at the reference  amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)),  as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age  or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating  occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts  are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption  surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child  under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed  per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1  through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based  on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such  Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially  formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years  of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large  sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic  characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on  consumption data under actual conditions of use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating  occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating  occasion were considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other  sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration.
