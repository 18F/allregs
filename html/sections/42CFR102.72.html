When the Secretary determines that  there is sufficient documentation in the Request Package to conduct an  evaluation of a requester's eligibility, he will begin the review to  determine whether the requester is eligible. If the Secretary determines  that the requester is not eligible, the Secretary will inform the  requester (or his or her representative) in writing of the disapproval  and the options available to the requester, including reconsideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Benefits determinations. If the Secretary determines that the  requester is eligible for benefits, he will, after receiving  documentation from the requester for a benefits determination, either  calculate the amount and types of benefits, as described in subpart I of  this part, or request additional documentation in order to calculate the  benefits that can be paid (e.g., an Explanation of Benefits from the  requester's insurance company if none was provided).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional documentation required. At any time after a Request  Form has been filed, the Secretary may direct a requester to supplement  or amend the Request Package by providing additional information or  documentation.</p>
