                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ethylene dichloride purification. The concentration of vinyl chloride in each exhaust gas stream from any equipment used in ethylene dichloride purification is not to exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), except as provided in Sec. 61.65(a). This requirement does not preclude combining of exhaust gas streams provided the combined steam is ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm, or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. This requirement does not apply to equipment that has been opened, is out of operation, and met the requirement in Sec. 61.65(b)(6)(i) before being opened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oxychlorination reactor. Except as provided in Sec. 61.65(a), emissions of vinyl chloride to the atmosphere from each oxychlorination reactor are not to exceed 0.2 g/kg (0.4 lb/ton) (average for 3-hour period) of the 100 percent ethylene dichloride product from the oxychlorination process.
