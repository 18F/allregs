                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manner of revoking election. A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section 615(e) or section 617(a) by filing with the internal revenue officer with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed, within the periods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the election previously made by him with respect to the deduction of mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and states with whom the document making the election was filed. A taxpayer revoking such an election shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation of election, for all taxable years affected by the revocation of election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) for provisions relating to the tolling of the statute of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent the deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of election under section 617(a). In applying the revocation of an election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the

taxpayer's taxable income, and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on other taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time for revoking election--(1) Election under section 615(e). An election under section 615(e) may be revoked at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period described in paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 15.1-1. Such an election may not be revoked after the expiration of the 3-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election under section 615(e). An election under section 615(e) may be revoked at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period described in paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 15.1-1. Such an election may not be revoked after the expiration of the 3-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Election under section 617(a). An election under section 617(a) may be revoked before the expiration of the last day of the third month following the month in which the final regulations issued under the authority of section 617 are published in the Federal Register. After the expiration of this period, a taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may not revoke that election unless he obtains the consent of the Secretary or his delegate in the manner to be set forth in the final regulations under section 617.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional information to be furnished by a transferor of mineral property. If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has transferred any mineral property with respect to which he deducted exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, to another person in a transaction as a result of which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, the statement submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall state that such property has been so transferred and shall identify the transferee, the property transferred, and the date of the transfer.</p>
