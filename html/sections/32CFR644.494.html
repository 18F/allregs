Improvements may be abandoned, destroyed or donated to  a public body, upon a finding in writing by the DE (but in no event  shall such finding be made by the official directly accountable for the  property) that the property has no commercial value or that the  estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the  estimated proceeds from its sale, or that abandonment or destruction is  required by military necessity, or by considerations of health, safety  or security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Finding of Fact. The finding will be prepared as a separate  document headed: Finding of Fact for ______ The finding will be  sufficiently complete within itself to justify the decision to donate,  abandon, or destroy the property proposed, without outside reference. It  will be drafted to provide, where the finding is made by the District  Engineer, for approval by the Division Engineer. Finding of fact  concerning property which had an original cost in excess of $500,000  requires the approval of DAEN-REM. A copy of each such finding, so  approved, will be forwarded by the DE to the regional office of GSA.</p>
