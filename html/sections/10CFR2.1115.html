                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After due consideration of the oral presentation and the written facts and data submitted by the parties and relied on at the oral argument, the presiding officer shall promptly by written order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designate any disputed issues of fact, together with any remaining issues of law, for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dispose of any issues of law or fact not designated for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing.
With regard to each issue designated for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing, the presiding officer shall identify the specific facts that are in genuine and substantial dispute, the reason why the decision of the Commission is likely to depend on the resolution of that dispute, and the reason why an adjudicatory hearing is likely to resolve the dispute. With regard to issues not designated for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing, the presiding officer shall include a brief statement of the reasons for the disposition. If the presiding officer finds that there are no disputed issues of fact or law requiring resolution in an adjudicatory hearing, the presiding officer shall also dismiss the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No issue of law or fact shall be designated for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing unless the presiding officer determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a genuine and substantial dispute of fact which can only be resolved with sufficient accuracy by the introduction of evidence in an adjudicatory hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decision of the Commission is likely to depend in whole or in part on the resolution of that dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In making a determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the presiding officer shall not consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any issue relating to the design, construction, or operation of any civilian nuclear power reactor already licensed to operate at the site, or any civilian nuclear power reactor for which a construction permit has been granted at the site, unless the presiding officer determines that any such issue substantially affects the design, construction, or operation of the facility or activity for which a license application, authorization, or amendment to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity is being considered; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any siting or design issue fully considered and decided by the Commission in connection with the issuance of a construction permit or operating license for a civilian nuclear power reactor at that site, unless (i) such issue results from any revision of siting or design criteria by the Commission following such decision; and (ii) the presiding officer determines that such issue substantially affects the design, construction, or operation of the facility or activity for which a license application, authorization, or amendment to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity is being considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply only with respect to licenses, authorizations, or amendments to licenses or authorizations applied for under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, before December 31, 2005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless the presiding officer disposes of all issues and dismisses the proceeding, appeals from the presiding officer's order disposing of issues and designating one or more issues for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing are interlocutory and must await the end of the proceeding.
