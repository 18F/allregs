                                Sec. 127.43  Petition of party for surplus proceeds had merchandise
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing of petition. Under section 491(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1491(d)), any party who can satisfactorily establish title to or a substantial interest in unclaimed and abandoned merchandise, the title to which has vested in the United States, may file a petition for the amount that would have been payable to the party had the merchandise been sold and a proper claim made under section 493, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1493).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When and with whom filed. The petition may be filed with the port director at whose direction the title to the merchandise was vested in the United States. If the party received notice under Sec. 127.41(b), the petition must be filed within 30 calendar days after the day on which title vested in the United States. If the party can satisfactorily establish that such notice was not received, the party must file the petition within 30 calendar days of learning of the vesting but not later than 90 calendar days from the vesting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence required. The petition must show the party's title to or interest in the merchandise, and be supported, as appropriate, with the original bill of lading, bill of sale, contract, mortgage, or other satisfactory documentary evidence, or a certified copy of the foregoing. Also, if applicable, the petition must be supported by satisfactoryproof that the petitioner did not receive notice that title to the merchandise would vest in the United States and was in such circumstances as prevented the receipt of notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of claim. If the claim of the owner, consignee, or other party having title to or a substantial interest in the merchandise, is properly established as provided in this section, the party may be paid out of the Treasury of the United States the amount that it is believed the party would have received under 19 U.S.C. 1493 had the merchandise been sold and a proper claim for the surplus of the proceeds of sale been made under that provision (see Sec. 127.36 of this part). In determining the amount that may have been payable under 19 U.S.C. 1493, given that the merchandise was not in fact sold at public auction under 19 U.S.C. 1491(a), the appraisement of the merchandise, as provided in Sec. 127.41(c), will be taken into consideration. By virtue of the authority delegated to the port director in this matter, any payment made as provided under this paragraph in connection with the filing of a petition under paragraph (b) of this section will be final and conclusive on all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Doubtful claim. Any doubtful claim for payment along with all pertinent documents and information available to the port director will be forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Administration, for instructions. The decision of the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Administration, with respect to any petition filed under this section will be final and conclusive on all parties.
