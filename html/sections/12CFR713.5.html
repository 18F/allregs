circumstances warrant.

This requirement does not apply to optional insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any proposal to reduce your required bond coverage must be approved in writing by the NCUA Board at least twenty days in advance of the proposed effective date of the reduction.
