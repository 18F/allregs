                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The tax imposed by section 4251 on amounts paid for  general telephone service does not apply to amounts paid for any such  service furnished on or after January 1, 1963, to the extent that the  amounts paid are for use of any telephone or radio telephone line or  channel (including equipment, instruments, and other apparatus furnished  exclusively for use in connection with the line or channel) in the  conduct of a trade or business when such line or channel is furnished  between specified locations in different States or between specified  locations in different counties, municipalities, or   similar political subdivisions of a State. The term ``trade or  business'' as used in this section includes activities of organizations  which are conducted with no purpose of gain or profit. A line or channel  is considered to be furnished between specified locations only when the  line or channel connects preselected points without the use of switching  functions performed by a communications company exchange. Where an  amount is paid which includes a charge for such a line or channel and  also a charge for the service provided by means of switching functions  performed by a communications company exchange, the exemption is  applicable only to that portion of the amount so paid as is attributable  to such a line or channel. The preselected points must be located in  different States or in different counties or municipalities of the same  State. If the preselected points are located in a State in which the  political subdivisions are not denominated as counties or  municipalities, then the preselected points must be in different  political subdivisions of such State which correspond to counties or  municipalities. For purposes of this paragraph the term ``municipality''  means the largest political subdivision of a State below the level of  county or similar subdivision. For the exemption to apply, the charge  for the service must be billed in writing to the person paying for the  service and such person must certify in writing that the service is for  use in the conduct of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption inapplicable. This particular exemption is not  applicable in the case of taxes imposed on amounts paid for other  services by section 4251, even though such services are utilized in the  conduct of a trade or business.</p>
