                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Merger valuation. Before selecting a bank merger partner and  voting on a proposal to merge, a credit union's board of directors must  determine, as part of its due diligence, the merger value of the credit  union. In making its determination of the merger value of the credit  union, the credit union must either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a well-publicized merger auction and obtain purchase  quotations from at least three banks, two or more of which must be stock  banks; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retain a qualified appraisal entity to analyze and estimate the  merger value of the credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advance notice. A credit union that does not conduct a public  auction as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must comply  with the following notice requirements before voting on a proposal to  merge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than 30 days before a board of directors votes on a  proposal to merge, it must publish a notice in a general circulation  newspaper, or in multiple newspapers if necessary, serving all areas  where the credit union has an office, branch, or service center. It must  also post the notice in a clear and conspicuous fashion in the lobby of  the credit union's home office and branch offices and on the credit  union's Web site, if it has one. If the notice is not on the home page  of the Web site, the home page must have a clear and conspicuous link,  visible on a standard monitor without scrolling, to the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The public notice must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of the credit union;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and type of institution into which the credit union's  board is considering a proposal to merge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A brief statement of why the board is considering the merger  and the major positive and negative effects of the proposed merger;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that directs members to submit any comments on the  proposal to the credit union's board of directors by regular mail,  electronic mail, or facsimile;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The date on which the board plans to vote on the proposal and  the date by which members must submit their comments for consideration;  which submission date may not be more than 5 days before the board vote;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The street address, electronic mail address, and facsimile  number of the credit union where members may submit comments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A statement that, in the event the board approves the proposal  to merge, the proposal will be submitted to the membership of the credit  union for a vote following a notice period that is no shorter than 90  days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The board of directors must approve publication of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Member comments. A credit union must collect and review any  member comments about the merger received during the merger process. The  credit union must retain the comments until the merger is consummated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval of proposal to merge. The merger proposal may only be  approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of board members who have  determined:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A merger with a bank is in the best interests of the members,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The merger partner selected by the directors is the best choice  for the members, taking into account the merger value of the credit  union and the amount that the selected merger partner is willing to pay  the credit union's members to effect the merger.</p>
