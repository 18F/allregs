                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the maximum mortgage limitations set forth in 24 CFR  200.15, a mortgage within the limits set forth in this section shall be  eligible for insurance under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Value limit. The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation  of not in excess of eighty-five percent (85%) for a   profit motivated borrower (ninety percent (90%) for a private nonprofit  borrower) of the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the project,  including major movable equipment to be used in its operation and any  repairs and improvements. The Commissioner's estimate of value shall  result from consideration of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Estimated market value of the Project by capitalization,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimated market value of the Project by direct sales  comparison, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Total estimated replacement cost of the Project.</p><p class="depth3">In the event the mortgage is secured by a leasehold estate rather  than a fee simple estate, the value of the property described in the  mortgage shall be the value of the leasehold estate (as determined by  the Commissioner) which shall in all cases be less than the value of the  property in fee simple.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debt service limit. The insured mortgage shall involve a  principal obligation not in excess of the amount that could be amortized  by eighty-five percent (85%) for a profit motivated borrower (ninety  percent (90%) for a private nonprofit borrower) of the net projected  project income available for payment of debt service. Net projected  Project income available for debt service shall be determined by  reducing the Commissioner's estimated gross income for the Project by a  vacancy and collection loss factor and by the cost of all estimated  operating expenses, including deposits to the reserve for replacements  and taxes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Project to be refinanced--additional limit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to  meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if  the Project is to be refinanced by the insured mortgage, the maximum  mortgage amount must not exceed the cost to refinance the existing  indebtedness. For the purposes of this requirement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Project shall not have changed ownership subsequent to the  date of application, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Project shall have been sold to a purchaser who has an  identity of interest with the seller (as defined by the Commissioner).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost to refinance the existing indebtedness will consist of  the following items, the eligibility and amounts of which must be  determined by the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount required to pay off the existing indebtedness;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the initial deposit for the reserve fund for  replacements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable and customary legal, organization, title, and  recording expenses, including mortgagee fees under Sec. 200.41;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The estimated repair costs, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Architect's and engineer's fees, municipal inspection fees, and  any other required professional or inspection fees; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The amount of any long-term debt service reserve account  required by the Commissioner pursuant to Sec. 232.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> of this  section) is paid by the purchaser separately from the purchase price.  The eligibility and amounts of these items must be determined in  accordance with standards established by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchase price is indicated in the purchase agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount for the initial deposit to the reserve fund for  replacements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable and customary legal, organizational, title, and  recording expenses, including mortgagee fees under Sec. 200.41;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The estimated repair cost, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Architect's and engineer's fees, municipal inspection fees, and  any other required professional or inspection fees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The amount of any long-term debt service reserve account  required by the Commissioner pursuant to Sec. 232.11.
