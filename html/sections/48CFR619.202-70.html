                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The Mentor-Protege Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist small businesses with business development, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The program is also designed to improve the performance of DOS contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between small businesses and prime contractors, and increase the overall number of small businesses that receive DOS contract and subcontract awards. The program is limited to non-commercial item acquisitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions of small business (SB), HUBZone small business concern (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) are the same as found in FAR 2.101.</p><p class="depth2">Mentor means a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the Protege.</p><p class="depth2">Protege means a small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business that is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a mentor-Protege program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-affiliation. For purposes of the Small Business Act, a Protege firm is not considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely because the Protege firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General policy. (1) Eligible business prime contractors not included on the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'' that are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible Protege.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible business prime contractors not included on the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'' that are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible Protege.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A firm's status as a Protege under a DOS contract shall not have an effect on the firm's ability to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Incentives for prime contractor participation. (1) Under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E)), DOS is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated acquisitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E)), DOS is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract.

The Mentor-Protege Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Operations Director, OSDBU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Measurement of program success. The success of the DOS Mentor-Protege Program will be measured by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts awarded to Protege firms under DOS contracts from the date the Protege enters the program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to the Protege under other Federal agencies and commercial contracts; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The developmental assistance provided by the mentor firm and the resulting increase in the technical, managerial, financial or other capabilities of the Protege firm, as reported by the Protege.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Eligibility of mentor firms.
