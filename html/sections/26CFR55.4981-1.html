                                Sec. 55.4981-1  Imposition of excise tax on certain real estate   year; taxable years ending on or before January 1, 1987.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 4981 as in effect before amendment by the Tax Reform Act of  1986 imposes an excise tax on a real estate investment trust if the  deduction for dividends paid for the taxable year does not equal at  least 75 percent of its real estate investment trust taxable income  (computed as provided in section 4981 as in effect before amendment by  the Tax Reform Act of 1986) for the taxable year. For purposes of  section 4981 as in effect before amendment by the Tax Reform Act of  1986, the deduction for dividends paid is computed without regard to  capital gains dividends (as defined in section 857(b)(3)(C)) and without  regard to any dividends actually paid after the close of the taxable  year. Thus, dividends considered as paid during the taxable year under  section 858 are disregarded. Deficiency dividends (as defined in section  860(f) paid with respect to the taxable year are also disregarded. The  return referred to in the last sentence of section 4981 as in effect  before amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in the income tax return.  Section 4981 as in effect before amendment by the Tax Reform Act of  1986, applies only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1979  and ending before January 1, 1987, for which the taxpayer is taxable  under Part II of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of subtitle A as a real  estate investment trust.  [T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11282, Feb. 6, 1981; 46 FR 15263, Mar. 5, 1981; T.D.  7936, 49 FR 2109, Jan. 18, 1984; T.D. 8180, 53 FR 6147, Mar. 1, 1988]</p>
