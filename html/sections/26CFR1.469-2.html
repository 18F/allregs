For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), a disposition of an interest in property is deemed to occur on the date that the interest in property becomes subject to an oral or written agreement that either requires the owner or gives the owner an option to transfer the interest in property for consideration that is fixed or otherwise determinable on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Substantially appreciated property. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is substantially appreciated if the fair market value of the interest in property exceeds 120 percent of the adjusted basis of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Investment property. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is treated as an interest in property used in an activity other than a passive activity and as an interest in property held for investment for any period during which the interest is held through a C corporation or similar entity. An entity is similar to a C corporation for this purpose if the owners of interests in the entity derive only portfolio income (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T) from the interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Coordination with Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii). If Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) applies to the disposition of an interest in property, this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) applies only to that portion of the gain from the disposition of the interest in property that is characterized as gain from a passive activity after the application of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Coordination with section 163(d). Gain that is treated as not from a passive activity under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) is treated as income described in section 469(e)(1)(A) and Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i) if and only if the gain is from the disposition of an interest in property that was held for investment for more than 50 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held that interest in property in activities other than passive activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A acquires a building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a trade or business activity in which A materially participates until March 31, 2004. On April 1, 2004, A leases the building to B. On December 31, 2005, A sells the building. At the time of the sale, A's interest in the building is substantially appreciated (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). Assuming A's lease of the building to B constitutes a rental activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)), the building is used in a passive activity for 21 months (April 1, 2004, through December 31, 2005). Thus, the building was not used in a passive activity for the entire 24-month period ending on the date of the sale. In addition, the 21-month period during which the building was used in a passive activity is less than 20 percent of A's holding period for the building (13 years). Therefore, the gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, is a stockholder of corporation X. X is a C corporation until December 31, 1993, and is an S corporation thereafter. X acquires a building on January 1, 1993, and sells the building on March 1, 1994. At the time of the sale, A's interest in the building held through X is substantially appreciated (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). The building is leased to various tenants at all times during the period in which it is held by X. Assume that the lease of the building would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)) with respect to a person that holds the building directly or through an S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section provides that an interest in property is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as used in an activity other than a passive activity and as held for investment for any period during which the interest is held through a C corporation. Thus, for purposes of determining the character of A's gain from the sale of the building, A's interest in the building is treated as an interest in property held for investment for the period from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993, and as an interest in property used in a passive activity for the period from January 1, 1994, to February 28, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A's interest in the building was not used in a passive activity for the entire 24-month period ending on the date of the sale.

In addition, the 2-month period during which A's interest in the building was used in a passive activity is less than 20 percent of the period during which A held an interest in the building (14 months). Therefore, the gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, gain that is treated as nonpassive under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) is treated as portfolio income (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) if the gain is from the disposition of an interest in property that was held for investment for more than 50 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in activities other than passive activities. In this case, A's interest in the building was treated as held for investment for the entire period during which it was used in activities other than passive activities (i.e., the 12-month period from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993). Accordingly, A's gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as portfolio income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxable acquisitions. If a taxpayer acquires an interest in property in a transaction other than a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45)), the ownership and use of the interest in property before the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2) to any subsequent disposition of the interest in property by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Property held for sale to customers--(A) Sale incidental to another activity--(1) Applicability--(i) In general. This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sale incidental to another activity--(1) Applicability--(i) In general. This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability--(i) In general. This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the time of the disposition, the taxpayer holds the interest in property in an activity that, for purposes of section 1221(1), involves holding the property or similar property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (a dealing activity);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One or more other activities of the taxpayer do not involve holding similar property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (nondealing activities) and the interest in property was used in the nondealing activity or activities for more than 80 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The interest in property was not acquired and held by the taxpayer for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Principal purpose. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A), a taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired and held an interest in property for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer does not exceed the lesser of 24 months or 20 percent of the recovery period (within the meaning of section 168) applicable to the property; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The interest in property was simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for more than 25 percent of the period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of the preceding sentence, an interest in property is not considered to be offered for sale to customers solely because a lessee of the property has been granted an option to purchase the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dealing activity not taken into account. If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property, holding the interest in the dealing activity is treated, for purposes of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in the last nondealing activity of the taxpayer in which the interest in property was used prior to its disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use in a nondealing activity incidental to sale. If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property that is held in a dealing activity of the taxpayer at the time of disposition, the use of the interest in property in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for any period during which the interest in property is also offered for sale to customers is treated, for purposes of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in property in the dealing activity of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1,

1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. In January 1996, the taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under Sec. 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activity.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until they are sold. The units are first held for sale on January 1, 1996, and the last unit is sold on December 31, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This paragraph (c)(2)(v) provides that holding an interest in property in a dealing activity (the marketing of the property) is treated for purposes of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2) as the use of the interest in a nondealing activity if the marketing of the property is incidental to the nondealing use. Under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(2) of this section, the interests in property are treated as used in the last nondealing activity in which they were used prior to their disposition. In addition, paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1) of this section provides rules for determining whether the marketing of the property is incidental to the use of an interest in property in a nondealing activity. Under these rules, the marketing of the property is treated as incidental to the use in a nondealing activity if the interest in property was used in nondealing activities for more than 80 percent of the taxpayer's holding period in the property (the holding period requirement) and the taxpayer did not acquire and hold the interest in property for the principal purpose of selling it to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (a dealing purpose).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In this case, the apartments were used in a rental activity for the entire period during which they were held by the taxpayer. Thus, the apartments were used in a nondealing activity for more than 80 percent of the taxpayer's holding period in the property, and the marketing of the property satisfies the holding period requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have a dealing purpose unless the interest in property was used in nondealing activities for more than 24 months or 20 percent of the property's recovery period (whichever is less). The same presumption applies if the interest in property was offered for sale to customers during more than 25 percent of the period in which the interest was held in nondealing activities. In this case, the taxpayer used each apartment in a nondealing activity (the rental activity) for a period of 36 to 48 months (i.e., from January 1, 1993, to the date of sale in the period from January through December 1996). Thus, the apartments were used in nondealing activities for more than 24 months, and the first of the rebuttable presumptions described above does not apply. In addition, the apartments were offered for sale to customers for up to 12 months (depending on the month in which the apartment was sold) during the period in which the apartments were used in a nondealing activity. The percentage obtained by dividing the period during which an apartment was held for sale to customers by the period during which the apartment was used in nondealing activities ranges from zero in the case of apartments sold on January 1, 1996, to 25 percent (i.e., 12 months/48 months) in the case of apartments sold on December 31, 1996. Thus, no apartment was offered for sale to customers during more than 25 percent of the period in which it was used in nondealing activities, and the second rebuttable presumption does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Because neither of the rebuttable presumptions in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1)((ii) of this section applies in this case, the taxpayer will not be treated as having a dealing purpose unless other facts and circumstances establish that the taxpayer acquired and held the apartments for the principal purpose of selling the apartments to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Assume that none of the facts and circumstances suggest that the taxpayer had such a purpose. If that is the case, the taxpayer does not have a dealing purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The marketing of the property satisfies the holding period requirement, and the taxpayer does not have a dealing purpose. Thus, holding the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) as the use of the apartments in a nondealing activity. In this case, the rental activity is the only nondealing activity in which the apartments were used prior to their disposition. Thus, the apartments are treated under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(2) of this section as interests in property that were used only in the rental activity for the entire period during which the taxpayer held the interests. Accordingly, the rules in Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) and paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply, and all gain from the sale of the apartments is treated as passive activity gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. The taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units on July 1, 1993. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under Sec. 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activities.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until

they are sold. The first unit is sold on January 1, 1994, and the last unit is sold on December 31, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, all of the apartments were simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for more than 25 percent of the period during which the apartments were used in nondealing activities. Thus, the taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired the apartments (including apartments that are used in the rental activity for at least 24 months) for the principal purpose of selling them to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Assume that the facts and circumstances do not rebut this presumption. If that is the case, the taxpayer has a dealing purpose, and paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of the apartments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section provides that if paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property that is held in a dealing activity of the taxpayer at the time of the disposition, the use of the interest in property in any nondealing activity of the taxpayer for any period during which the interest is also offered for sale to customers is treated as incidental to the use of the interest in the dealing activity. Accordingly, for purposes of applying the rules of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2) to the disposition of the apartments, the rental of the apartments after July 1, 1993, is treated as the use of the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. In January 1996, the taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under Sec. 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activities.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until they are sold. The units are first held for sale on January 1, 1996, and the last unit is sold in 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The treatment of apartments sold in 1996 is the same as in Example 1. The apartments sold in 1997, however, were simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity for more than 25 percent of the period during which the apartments were used in nondealing activities. (For example, an apartment that is sold on January 31, 1997, has been offered for sale for 13 months or 26.1 percent of the 49-month period during which it was used in nondealing activities.) Thus, the taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired the apartments sold in 1997 for the principal purpose of selling them to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business. Assume that the facts and circumstances do not rebut this presumption. In that case, the marketing of the apartments sold in 1997 does not satisfy the principal purpose requirement, and paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of those apartments. Accordingly, for purposes of applying the rules of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2) to the disposition of the apartments sold in 1997, the rental of the apartments after January 1, 1996, is treated, under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section, as the use of the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)-(c)(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)-(c)(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)</em> Gross income from certain oil or gas properties--(i) In general.

In 1993, P drills a well on its tract, and A's distributive share of P's losses from drilling the well are treated under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4) as not from a passive activity. In the course of selecting the drilling site and drilling the well, P develops information indicating that the reservior in which the well was drilled underlies R's tract as well as P's. Under these facts, P's and R's tracts are treated as one property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), even if A's interests in the mineral deposits in the tracts are treated as separate properties under section 614(a). Accordingly, in 1994 and subsequent years, A's distributive share of both P's and R's income and expenses from their respective tracts is taken into account in computing A's net passive income from the property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B is a general partner in partnership S. S owns an oil and gas working interest in a single tract of land. In 1993, S drills a well, and B's distributive share of S's losses from drilling the well is treated under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4) as not from a passive activity. In the course of drilling the well, S discovers two oil-bearing formations, one underlying the other. On December 1, 1993, S completes the well in the underlying formation. On January 1, 1994, B converts B's entire general partnership interest in S into a limited partnership interest. In 1994, S completes in, and commences production from, the shallow formation. Under these facts, the two mineral deposits in S's tract are treated as one property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), even if they are treated as separate properties under section 614(a). Accordingly, B's distributive share of S's income and expenses from both the underlying formation and from recompletion in and production from the shallow formation is taken into account in computing B's net passive income from the property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)(iv)</em> Example 3--(c)(7)(iii) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(iv)</em> Example 3--(c)(7)(iii) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example 3--(c)(7)(iii) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(7)(iv)</em> Gross income of an individual from a covenant by such individual not to compete;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(iv)</em> Gross income of an individual from a covenant by such individual not to compete;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gross income of an individual from a covenant by such individual not to compete;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Gross income that is treated as not from a passive activity under any provision of the regulations under section 469, including but not limited to Sec. 1.469-1T(h)(6) (relating to income from intercompany transactions of members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return) and Sec. 1.469-2T(f) and paragraph (f) of this section (relating to recharacterized passive income);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Gross income attributable to the reimbursement of a loss from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft (as such terms are used in section 165(c)(3)) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The reimbursement is included in gross income under Sec. 1.165-1(d)(2)(iii) (relating to reimbursements of losses that the taxpayer deducted in a prior taxable year); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The deduction for the loss was not a passive activity deduction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(7)(vii)</em> Gross income or gain allocable to business or rental use of a dwelling unit for any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to such business or rental use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(vii)</em> Gross income or gain allocable to business or rental use of a dwelling unit for any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to such business or rental use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Gross income or gain allocable to business or rental use of a dwelling unit for any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to such business or rental use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)-(d)(2)(viii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)-(d)(2)(viii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> An item of loss or deduction that is carried to the taxable year under section 172(a), section 613A(d), section 1212(a)(1) (in the case of corporations), or section 1212(b) (in the case of taxpayers other than corporations);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> An item of loss or deduction that would have been allowed for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, but for section 704(d), 1366, or 465;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> A deduction for a loss from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft (as such terms are used in section 165(c)(3)) if losses that are similar in cause and severity do not recur regularly in the conduct of the activity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> A deduction or loss allocable to business or rental use of a dwelling unit for any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to such business or rental use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)-(d)(5)(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)-(d)(5)(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(5)(iii)</em> Other applicable rules--(A) Applicability of rules in Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2).

In 1993, P acquires an interest in undeveloped land and arranges for the financing and construction of an office building on the land. Construction is completed in February 1995, and substantially all of the building is either rented or held out for rent and in a state of readiness for rental beginning on March 1, 1995.

P did not hold the building (or any other buildings) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of P's trade or business (see paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section). A's distributive share of P's taxable losses from the rental of the building is $50,000 for 1995 and $30,000 for 1996. All of A's losses from the rental of the building are disallowed under 1.469-1(a)(1)(i) (relating to the disallowance of the passive activity loss for the taxable year). A's distributive share of P's gain from the sale of the building is $150,000. A has no other gross income or deductions from the activity of renting the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The real estate development activity that A holds through P in 1993, 1994, and 1995 involves the performance of services (e.g., construction) for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building.

Under paragraph (f)(9)(iv) of this section, A's net rental activity income from the building for 1997 is $70,000 ($150,000 distributive share of gain from the disposition of the building minus $80,000 of reasonably allocable passive activity deductions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar year taxpayer subject to section 469, acquires a building on February 1, 1994, when the building is 25 percent leased.

X's activities do not otherwise involve the performance of construction or other services for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building, and X does not hold the building (or any other building) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of X's trade or business.

The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that at the time X acquires the building it is 60 percent leased. Under paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, lease-up is not considered a service performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of property if more than 50 percent of the property is leased on the date the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property. Therefore, additional lease-up performed by X is not taken into account under this paragraph (f)(5). Since X's activities do not otherwise involve the performance of services for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building, none of X's gross rental activity income from the building will be treated as income that is not from a passive activity under this paragraph (f)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(6)</em> Property rented to a nonpassive activity.

This section contains rules for determining the amount of the taxpayer's passive activity loss for the taxable year for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder. The rules contained in this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide general guidance for identifying items of income and deduction that are taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specify particular items of income and deduction that are not taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the manner in which provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations, other than section 469 and the regulations thereunder, are applied for purposes of determining the

extent to which items of deduction are taken into account for a taxable year in computing the amount of the passive activity loss for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of passive activity loss--(1) In general. In the case of a taxpayer other than a closely held corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), the passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year exceed the passive activity gross income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of a taxpayer other than a closely held corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), the passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year exceed the passive activity gross income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cross references. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of ``passive activity gross income,'' paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of ``passive activity deduction,'' and Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(4) for the computation of the passive activity loss of a closely held corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Passive activity gross income--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for a taxable year includes an item of gross income if and only if such income is from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for a taxable year includes an item of gross income if and only if such income is from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of gain from disposition of an interest in an activity or an interest in property used in an activity--(i) In general--(A) Treatment of gain. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition (a ``disposition'') of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation is treated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--(A) Treatment of gain. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition (a ``disposition'') of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation is treated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gain is treated as gross income from such activity for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as passive activity gross income for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the activity is not a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dispositions of partnership interests and S corporation stock. A partnership interest or S corporation stock is not property used in an activity for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules treating the gain recognized upon the disposition of a partnership interest or S corporation stock as gain from the disposition of interests in the activities in which the partnership or S corporation has an interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interest in property. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2) to a disposition of property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any material portion of the property that was used, at any time before the disposition, in any activity at a time when the remainder of the property was not used in such activity shall be treated as a separate interest in property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of the property must be allocated among the separate interests in a reasonable manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(i):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owns an interest in a trade or business activity in which A has never materially participated. In 1987, A sells equipment that was used exclusively in the activity and realizes a gain on the sale. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(2) of this section, the gain is passive activity gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B owns an interest in a trade or business activity in which B materially participates for 1987. In 1987, B sells a building used in the activity in an installment sale and realizes a gain on the sale. B does not materially participate in the activity for 1988 or any subsequent year. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(3) of this section, none of B's gain from the sale (including gain taken into account after 1987) is passive activity gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C enters into a contract to acquire property used by the seller in a rental activity. Before acquiring the property pursuant to the contract, C sells all rights under the contract and realizes a gain on the sale. Since C's rights under the contract are not property used in a rental activity, the gain is not income from a rental activity. The result would be the same if C owned an option to acquire the property and sold the option.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. D sells a ten-floor office building. D owned the building for three years preceding the sale and at all times during that period used seven floors of the building in a trade or business activity and three floors in a rental activity. The fair market value per square foot is substantially the same throughout the building, and D did not

maintain a separate adjusted basis for any part of the building. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(1) of this section, the seven floors used in the trade or business activity and the three floors used in the rental activity are treated as separate interests in property. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(2) of this section, the amount realized and the adjusted basis of the building must be allocated between the separate interests in a reasonable manner. Under these facts, an allocation based on the square footage of the parts of the building used in each activity would be reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that two of the seven floors used in the trade or business activity were used in the rental activity until five months before the sale. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(1) of this section, the five floors used exclusively in the trade or business activity and the two floors used first in the rental activity and then in the trade or business activity are treated as separate interests in property. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for rules for allocating amount realized and adjusted basis upon a disposition of an interest in property used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disposition of property used in more than one activity in 12-month period preceding disposition. In the case of a disposition of an interest in property that is used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition, the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of such interest must be allocated among such activities on a basis that reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property during such 12-month period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), an allocation of the amount realized and adjusted basis solely to the activity in which an iterest in property is predominantly used during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property if the fair market value of such interest does not exceed the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $10,000; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 10 percent of the sum of the fair market value of such interest and the fair market value of all other property used in such activity immediately before the disposition.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The facts are the same as in Example 5 of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(2) of this section, D allocates the amount realized and adjusted basis of the building 30 percent to the three floors used exclusively in the rental activity, 50 percent to the five floors used exclusively in the trade or business activity, and 20 percent to the two floors used first in the rental activity and then in the trade or business activity. Under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the amount realized and adjusted basis allocated to the two floors that were used in both activities during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition must also be allocated between such activities. Under these facts, an allocation of \7/12\ of such amounts to the rental activity and \5/12\ of such amounts to the trade or business activity would reasonably reflect the use of the two floors during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B is a limited partner in a partnership that sells a tractor-trailer. During the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, the tractor-trailer was used in several activities, and the partnership allocates the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of the tractor-trailer among the activities based on the number of days during the 12-month period that the partnership used the tractor-trailer in each activity. Under these facts, the partnership's allocation reasonably reflects the use of the tractor-trailer during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C sells a personal computer for $8,000. During the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, 70 percent of C's use of the computer was in a passive activity. Immediately before the sale, the fair market value of all property used in the passive activity (including the personal computer) was $200,000. Under these facts, the computer was predominatly used in the passive activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, and the value of the computer, as measured by its sale price ($8,000), does not exceed the lesser of (a) $10,000, and (b) 10 percent of the value of all property used in the activity immediately before the sale ($20,000). C allocates the amount realized and the adjusted basis solely to the passive activity. Under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), C's allocation reasonably reflects the use of the computer during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly used in nonpassive activity. [Reserved]. See Sec. 1.469-4(c)(2)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxable acquisitions. [Reserved].

See Sec. 1.469-2(c)(v) for rules relating to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Items of portfolio income specifically excluded--(i) In general.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, an individual engaged in the trade or business of farming, disposes of farmland in an installment sale. A is not engaged in a trade or business of selling farmland. Therefore, A's interest income from the installment note is not gross income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. P, a partnership, operates a rental apartment building for low-income tenants in City Y. Under Y's laws relating to the operation of low-income housing, P is required to maintain a reserve fund to pay for the maintenance and repair of the building. P invests the reserve fund in short-term interest-bearing deposits. Because P's interest income from the investment of the reserve fund is not interest income described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, such income is not treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Accordingly, P's interest income from the deposits is portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in an activity involving the conduct of a trade or business of dealing in securities. On February 1, the partnership acquires certain securities for investment (within the meaning of section 163(d)). On February 2, before recognizing any income with respect to the securities, the partnership determines that it would be advisable to hold the securities primarily for sale to customers and subsequently sells them to customers in the ordinary course of its business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, income or gain from any security (including any security acquired pursuant to an investment of working capital) held by a dealer for investment at any time before such income or gain is recognized is not treated for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section as derived by the dealer in the ordinary course of its trade or business of dealing in securities. Accordingly, B's distributive share of the partnership's interest, dividends, or gains from the securities acquired by the partnership for investment on February 1 is portfolio income of B, notwithstanding that such securities were held by

the partnership, subsequent to February 1, primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business of dealing in securities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. C is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in an activity of trading or dealing in royalty interests in mineral properties. The partnership derives royalty income from royalty interests held in the activity. If the activity is a trade or business activity, C's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income from such royalty interests is treated under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section as derived in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D, a calendar year individual, is a partner in a calendar year partnership that is engaged in an activity of developing and marketing a design for a system that reduces air pollution in office buildings. D has a 10 percent distributive share of all items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit. In 1987, the partnership acquired the rights to the design for $100,000. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, the partnership incurs expenditures with respect to the development and marketing of the design, and derives gross royalties from licensing the design, in the amounts set forth in the table below. The expenditures incurred in 1987 and 1988 are currently deductible expenses. The expenditures incurred in 1989 are capitalized and may be deducted only in subsequent taxable years.

The expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership in 1987 with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($8,000) do not exceed 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($20,000). In addition, the sum of such expenditures incurred in 1987 and all prior taxable years ($8,000) does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures made by the partnership in all such taxable years with respect to the design ($100,000). Accordingly, for 1987, the partnership is not treated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design. Therefore, unless all of the facts and circumstances indicate that the partnership performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income for 1987 is portfolio income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As of the end of 1988, the sum of the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership during such taxable year and all prior taxable years with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($20,000) does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures made by the partnership in all such years with respect to the design ($100,000). However, the amount of such expenditures incurred by the partnership in 1988 ($12,000) exceeds 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($20,000). Accordingly, for 1988, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii)(a) of this section, the partnership is treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, and D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income for 1988 is considered for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is not portfolio income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership in 1989 with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($15,000) do not exceed 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($60,000). However, the sum of such expenditures incurred by the partnership in 1989 and all prior taxable years ($35,000) exceeds 25 percent of the partnership's aggregate capital expenditures made in all such years with respect to the design ($115,000). Accordingly, for 1989, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii)(b) of this section, the partnership is treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, and D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income in 1989 is considered for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is not portfolio income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The result for 1990 is the same as for 1989, notwithstanding that the partnership incurs no expenditures in 1990 with respect to the development or marketing of the design.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that, for 1987, D's distributive share of the partnership's development and marketing costs is 15 percent, while D's distributive share of the partnership's gross royalties is 10 percent. Although D's distributive share of the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership during 1987

with respect to the development and marketing of the design ($1,200) is more than 50 percent of D's distributive share of the partnership's gross royalties from licensing the design ($2,000), D is not treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design for 1987 under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii)(a) of this section. This is because, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(3) of this section, the determination of whether the royalties are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business is made by applying paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to the partnership, and not to D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Items of personal service income specifically excluded--(i) In general.

The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1987, A, a calendar year individual, acquires a partnership interest in R, a calendar year partnership. R's only activity is a trade or business activity in which A materially participates for 1987. R incurs a loss in 1987. A's distributive share of R's 1987 loss is $1,000. However, A's basis in the partnership interest at the end of 1987 (without regard to A's distributive share of partnership loss) is $600; accordingly, section 704(d) disallows any deduction in 1987 for $400 of A's distributive share of R's loss. The remainder of A's distributive share of R's loss would be allowed as a deduction for 1987 if taxable income for all taxable years were determined without regard to sections 469, 613A(d), and 1211. See paragraph (d)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A does not materially participate in R's activity for 1988. In 1988, R again incurs a loss, and A's distributive share of the loss is again $1,000. At the end of 1988, A's basis in the partnership interest (without regard to A's distributive share of partnership loss) is $2,000; accordingly, in 1988 section 704(d) does not limit A's deduction for either A's $1,000 distributive share of R's 1988 loss or the $400 loss carried over from 1987 under the second sentence of section 704(d). These losses would be allowed as a deduction for 1988 if taxable income for all taxable years were determined without regard to sections 469, 613A(d) and 1211. See paragraph (d)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under these facts, only $400 of A's distributive share of R's deductions from the activity are disallowed under section 704(d) in 1987. A's remaining deductions from the activity are treated as deductions that arise in connection with the activity for 1987 under paragraph (d)(8) of this section. Because A materially participates in the activity for 1987, the activity is not a passive activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(1)) of A for such year. Accordingly, the deductions that are not disallowed in 1987 are not passive activity deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A does not materially participate in R's activity for 1988. Accordingly, the activity is a passive activity of A for such year. No portion of A's distributive share of R's deductions from the activity is disallowed under section 704(d) in 1988. Accordingly, A's distributive share of R's deductions for 1988 and the $400 of deductions carried over from 1987 are both treated under paragraph (d)(8) of this section as deductions that arise in 1988.

This gain would have been treated as gain that is not from a passive activity under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and would have exceeded 10 percent of the total amount of B's gain that is allocated to the dealership activity under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, B's gain from the sale ($14,000) is treated as gain that is not from a passive activity to the extent that such gain does not exceed the amount of gain subject to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section that B would have been allocated with respect to the interest sold to D if R had sold all of the property used in the dealership activity immediately prior to B's sale ($13,000).

Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, a ratable portion of A's gross income from activities X and Z (A's significant participation passive activities with net passive income for the taxable year) is treated as gross income that is not from a passive activity. The ratable portion is determined by dividing (a) the amount by which A's passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities exceeds A's passive activity deductions from significant participation passive activities for the taxable year ($700) by (b) such excess taking into account only A's significant participation passive activities having net passive income for the taxable year ($1,000).

The unadjusted basis of the improvements ($100,000) equals 25 percent of the unadjusted basis of all property ($400,000) used in the rental activity.

The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example: (i) A, a calendar year individual, acquires on January 1, 1988, a limited partnership interest in P, a calendar year partnership. Under the partnership agreement, A has a one percent share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of P. A acquires the partnership interest for $90,000, using $50,000 of unborrowed funds and $40,000 of proceeds of a loan bearing interest at an annual rate of 10 percent. A pays $4,000 of interest on the loan in 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P's sole activity is a trade or business of lending money. A does not materially participate in the activity for 1988. During 1988, the average outstanding balance of P's interest-bearing assets (including loans to customers, temporary deposits with other lending institutions, and government and corporate securities) is $20 million. P incurs numerous interest-bearing liabilities in connection with its lending activity, including liabilities for deposits taken from customers, unsecured short-term and long-term loans from other lending institutions, and a mortgage loan secured by the building, owned by P, in which P conducts its business. For 1988, the average outstanding balance of all of these liabilities (other than the mortgage loan) is $11 million. None of these liabilities was incurred by P principally for the purpose of increasing the percentage described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The interest income derived by P for 1988 from its interest-bearing assets is $2.2 million. The interest expense paid by P for 1988 with respect to the liabilities incurred in connection with its lending activity (other than the mortgage loan) is $990,000. P's other expenses for 1988 that are reasonably allocable to P's gross interest income (including expenses for advertising, loan processing and servicing, and insurance, and depreciation on P's building) total $250,000. P's interest expense for 1988 on the mortgage loan secured by the building used in P's lending activity is $50,000. All of the interest expense paid or incurred by P for 1988 is allocated under Sec. 1.63-8T to expeditures in connection with P's lending activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, P's activity is an equity-financed lending activity for 1988, since, for 1988, the activity involves a trade or business of lending money and the average outstanding balance

of the liabilities incurred in the activity ($11 million) does not exceed 80 percent of the average outstanding balance of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity ($20 million). Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, an amount of A's gross income from the activity equal to the lesser of (a) A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988, or (b) A's net passive income from the activity for 1988, is treated as income that is not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988 is determined by multiplying A's net interest income from the activity for 1988 by the fraction obtained by dividing $9 million (the excess of the average interest-bearing assets for 1988 over the average interest-bearing liabilities for 1988) by $20 million (the average interest-bearing assets for 1988). Under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, A's net interest income from the activity for 1988 is $19,000 (A's distributive share of $2.2 million of gross interest income less A's distributive share of $300,000 of expenses described in paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, including interest expense on the mortgage loan). A's distributive share of P's other interest expense ($990,000) is not taken into account in computing A's net interest income for 1988. Accordingly, A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988 is $8,550 ($19,000x$9 million/$20 million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section, A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 is determined by taking into account A's distributive share of P's gross income and deductions from the activity for 1988, as well as any interest expense incurred by A individually that is taken into account under Sec. 1.163-8T in determining A's income or loss from the activity for 1988. Assuming that for 1988 all $4,000 of interest expense on the loan that A used to finance the acquisition of A's interest in P is allocated under Sec. 1.163-8T to expenditures of A in connection with the lending activity for 1988, A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 is $5,100, computed as set forth in the following table:
Gross income:</p><p class="depth0">Interest income..........................................     $22,000Deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Distributive share of P's expenses from the activity.....     (12,900)</p><p class="depth0">Interest expense on A's acquisition debt.................      (4,000)</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Net passive income.......................................       5,100</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 ($5,100) is less than A's equity-financed income from the activity for 1988 ($8,550). Accordingly, under this paragraph (f)(4), $5,100 of A's gross income from the activity for 1988 is treated as not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Net income from certain property rented incidental to development activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(7):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 5 in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, except that, in 1988, D's 10 percent partnership interest is sold to F for $13,000, all of which is attributable to the design licensed by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 1988, the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership with respect to the development or marketing of the design satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii)(a) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section does not apply to F's distributive share of the partnership's gross income from licensing the design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 1989, the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership with respect to the development or marketing of the design do not satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(ii)(a) of this section. Moreover, F's distributive share of such expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership for 1988 and 1989 ($27,000x.10 = $2,700) does not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of F's interest in the design at the time F acquired the partnership interest ($13,000). Accordingly, neither of the exceptions provided in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section applies for 1989 and, under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, an amount of F's gross royalty income from the design equal to F's net royalty income from the design is treated as not from a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Limitation on recharacterized income.
