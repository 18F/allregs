                                Sec. 502.26  How does OTS calculate the semi-annual assessment for savings and loan holding companies?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OTS calculates the semi-annual assessment savings and loan holding companies as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OTS will assess a base assessment amount of $3,500 on responsible savings and loan holding companies. The base assessment amount reflects OTS's estimate of the base costs of conducting on- and off-site supervision of a noncomplex, low risk savings and loan holding company structure. OTS will periodically revise this amount to reflect changes in inflation based on a readily available index. OTS will establish the revised amount of the base assessment in a Thrift Bulletin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OTS will add three components to the base assessment amount to compute the amount of the semi-annual assessment for responsible savings and loan holding companies: a component based on the risk or complexity of the savings and loan holding company's business, a component based on its organizational form, and a component based on its condition. OTS determines the amount of each component under Sec. Sec. 502.27 through 502.29 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of the semi-annual assessment of savings and loan holding companies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible holding company is the registered holding company at the highest level of ownership in a holding

company structure, unless OTS designates another savings and loan holding company in the holding company structure. OTS may designate an intermediate-tier holding company if the assessment of this entity would more accurately reflect OTS costs of supervising the holding company structure and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There are multiple top-tier holding companies in the holding company structure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The top-tier holding company is organized outside of the United States, and is subject to the consolidated review of a foreign regulator; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other circumstances indicate that the assessment of the top-tier holding company is inappropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total consolidated holding company assets are the total assets as reported on the Thrift Financial Report, Schedule HC. If Schedule HC is unavailable, OTS will use total assets reported on report H-(b)11. OTS uses information contained in the September 30 Schedule HC or report H-(b)11 to determine amounts due at the January 31 assessment; and the March 31 Schedule HC or report H-(b)11 to determine amounts due at the July 31 assessment.
