                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to part 745.</p><p class="depth0">Arithmetic mean means the algebraic sum of data values divided by the number of data values (e.g., the sum of the concentration of lead in several soil samples divided by the number of samples).</p><p class="depth0">Chewable surface means an interior or exterior surface painted with lead-based paint that a young child can mouth or chew. A chewable surface is the same as an ``accessible surface'' as defined in 42 U.S.C. 4851b(2)). Hard metal substrates and other materials that cannot be dented by the bite of a young child are not considered chewable.</p><p class="depth0">Common area group means a group of common areas that are similar in design, construction, and function. Common area groups include, but are not limited to hallways, stairwells, and laundry rooms.</p><p class="depth0">Concentration means the relative content of a specific substance contained within a larger mass, such as the amount of lead (in micrograms per gram or parts per million by weight) in a sample of dust or soil.</p><p class="depth0">Deteriorated paint means any interior or exterior paint or other coating that is peeling, chipping, chalking or cracking, or any paint or coating located on an interior or exterior surface or fixture that is otherwise damaged or separated from the substrate.</p><p class="depth0">Dripline means the area within 3 feet surrounding the perimeter of a building.</p><p class="depth0">Friction surface means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to abrasion or friction, including, but not limited to, certain window, floor, and stair surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">Impact surface means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to damage by repeated sudden force such as certain parts of door frames.</p><p class="depth0">Interior window sill means the portion of the horizontal window ledge that protrudes into the interior of the room.</p><p class="depth0">Lead-based paint hazard means hazardous lead-based paint, dust-lead hazard or soil-lead hazard as identified in Sec. 745.65.</p><p class="depth0">Loading means the quantity of a specific substance present per unit of surface area, such as the amount of lead in micrograms contained in the dust collected from a certain surface area divided by the surface area in square feet or square meters.</p><p class="depth0">Mid-yard means an area of a residential yard approximately midway between the dripline of a residential building and the nearest property boundary or between the driplines of a residential building and another building on the same property.</p><p class="depth0">Play area means an area of frequent soil contact by children of less than 6 years of age as indicated by, but not limited to, such factors including the following: the presence of play equipment (e.g., sandboxes, swing sets, and sliding boards), toys, or other children's possessions, observations of play patterns, or information provided by parents, residents, care givers, or property owners.</p><p class="depth0">Residential building means a building containing one or more residential dwellings.</p><p class="depth0">Room means a separate part of the inside of a building, such as a bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, or utility room. To be considered a separate room, the room must be separated from adjoining rooms by built-in walls or archways that extend at least 6 inches from an intersecting wall. Half walls or bookcases count as room separators if built-in. Movable or collapsible partitions or partitions consisting solely of shelves or cabinets are not considered built-in walls. A screened in porch that is used as a living area is a room.</p><p class="depth0">Soil sample means a sample collected in a representative location using ASTM E1727, ``Standard Practice for

Field Collection of Soil Samples for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques,'' or equivalent method.</p><p class="depth0">Weighted arithmetic mean means the arithmetic mean of sample results weighted by the number of subsamples in each sample. Its purpose is to give influence to a sample relative to the surface area it represents. A single surface sample is comprised of a single subsample. A composite sample may contain from two to four subsamples of the same area as each other and of each single surface sample in the composite. The weighted arithmetic mean is obtained by summing, for all samples, the product of the sample's result multiplied by the number of subsamples in the sample, and dividing the sum by the total number of subsamples contained in all samples. For example, the weighted arithmetic mean of a single surface sample containing 60 [micro]g/ft\2\, a composite sample (three subsamples) containing 100 [micro]g/ft\2\, and a composite sample (4 subsamples) containing 110 [micro]g/ft\2\ is 100 [micro]g/ft\2\. This result is based on the equation [60+(3*100)+(4*110)]/(1+3+4).</p><p class="depth0">Window trough means, for a typical double-hung window, the portion of the exterior window sill between the interior window sill (or stool) and the frame of the storm window. If there is no storm window, the window trough is the area that receives both the upper and lower window sashes when they are both lowered. The window trough is sometimes referred to as the window ``well.''</p><p class="depth0">Wipe sample means a sample collected by wiping a representative surface of known area, as determined by ASTM E1728, ``Standard Practice for Field Collection of Settled Dust Samples Using Wipe Sampling Methods for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques, or equivalent method, with an acceptable wipe material as defined in ASTM E 1792, ``Standard Specification for Wipe Sampling Materials for Lead in Surface Dust.''</p>
