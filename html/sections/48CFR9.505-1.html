                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A contractor that provides systems engineering and technical  direction for a system but does not have overall contractual  responsibility for its development, its integration, assembly, and  checkout, or its production shall not (1) be awarded a contract to  supply the system or any of its major components or (2) be a  subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its  major components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all  of the following activities: determining specifications, identifying and  resolving interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating  test data, and supervising design. Technical direction includes a  combination of substantially all of the following activities: developing  work statements, determining parameters, directing other contractors'  operations, and resolving technical controversies. In performing these  activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible  position in determining a system's basic concepts and supervising their  execution by other contractors. Therefore this contractor should not be  in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or  capabilities.</p>
