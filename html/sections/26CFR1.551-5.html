                                Sec. 1.551-5  Effect on capital account of foreign personal holding
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 551(e) and 551(f) are designed to prevent double taxation with respect to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of sections 551(e) and 551(f) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The M Corporation is a foreign personal holding company. Seventy-five percent in value of its capital stock is owned by A, a citizen of the United States, and the remainder, or 25 percent, of its stock is owned by B, a nonresident alien individual. For the calendar year 1954 the M Corporation has an undistributed foreign personal holding company income of $100,000. A is required to include $75,000 of such income in gross income as a dividend in his return for the calendar year 1954. The $100,000 is treated as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to the capital of the M Corporation and its accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the calendar year 1954 are correspondingly reduced. If after treating such $100,000 as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, the M Corporation has no accumulatedearnings and profits at the close of 1954, and if for the calendar year 1955, the M Corporation had no earnings and profits, but distributed $40,000, the amount so distributed would be a nontaxable distribution and would not be included in the gross income of either A or B for the calendar year 1955. If, however, after treating the $100,000 as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, the M Corporation had accumulated earnings and profits of $100,000 at the close of 1954, the facts otherwise being the same, the distributions in 1955 would be taxable to A as a dividend, and the taxability of such distributions to B would depend upon the application of section 861(a)(2), relating to the treatment of dividends from a foreign corporation as income from sources within or without the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. In example 1 assume the basis of A's stock to be $300,000. If A includes in gross income in his return for the calendar year 1954, $75,000 as a dividend from the M Corporation, the basis of his stock would be $375,000. After the nontaxable distribution of $30,000 to A by the M Corporation in 1955 (75 percent of the $40,000 distribution) the basis of A's stock, assuming no other changes, would be $345,000. If A failed to include the $75,000 as a dividend in gross income in his return for 1954 and his failure was not discovered until after the 6-year period of limitations had expired, the application of the rule would not increase the basis of A's stock. The subsequent nontaxable distribution of $30,000 to A in 1955 would reduce his basis of $300,000 to $270,000, thus tending to compensate for his failure to include the amount of $75,000 as a dividend in his gross income for 1954. If the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the M Corporation is readjusted within the statutory period of limitations, thus increasing or decreasing the amount A would have to include in his gross income, proper adjustment is required to be made to the basis of A's stock on account of such readjustment.</p>
