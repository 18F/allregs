                            <p class="depth0">Tenders should be submitted on the printed forms and forwarded in  the special envelopes which will be supplied on application to any  Federal Reserve Bank, or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,  Washington, DC 20226. If a special envelope is not available, the  inscription ``Tender for Treasury Bills'' should be placed on the  envelope used. The instructions set forth in the public notice  announcing the offering should be observed with respect to the  submission of tenders. Banking institutions generally may submit tenders  for account of customers provided the names of the customers are set  forth in such tenders. Others than banking institutions, will not be  permitted to submit tenders except for their own account. Tenders from  incorporated banks and trust companies, and from responsible and  recognized dealers in investment securities will be received without  deposit. Tenders from all others must be accompanied by a payment of  such percent of the face amount of the Treasury bills applied for as the  Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time prescribe: Provided,  however, That such deposit will not be required if the tender is  accompanied by an express guaranty of payment in full by an incorporated  bank or trust company. Forfeiture of the prescribed payment may be  declared by the Secretary of the Treasury, if payment is not completed,  in the case of accepted tenders, on the prescribed date.</p>
