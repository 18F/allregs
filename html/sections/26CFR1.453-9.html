                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Subject to the exceptions contained in section  453(d)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section, the entire amount of gain  or loss resulting from any disposition or satisfaction of installment  obligations, computed in accordance with section 453(d), is recognized  in the taxable year of such disposition or satisfaction and shall be  considered as resulting from the sale or exchange of the property in  respect of which the installment obligation was received by the  taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of gain or loss. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of gain or loss  resulting under paragraph (a) of this section is the difference between  the basis of the obligation and (i) the amount realized, in the case of  satisfaction at other than face value or in the case of a sale or  exchange, or (ii) the fair market value of the obligation at the time of  disposition, if such disposition is other than by sale or exchange.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The basis of an installment obligation shall be the excess of  the face value of the obligation over an amount equal to the income  which would be returnable were the obligation satisfied in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. In 1960 the M Corporation sold a piece of unimproved real  estate to B for $20,000. The company acquired the property in 1948 at a  cost of $10,000. During 1960 the company received $5,000 cash and  vendee's notes for the remainder of the selling price, or $15,000,  payable in subsequent years. In 1962, before the vendee made any further  payments, the company sold the notes for $13,000 in cash. The  corporation makes its returns on the calendar year basis. The income to  be reported for 1962 is $5,500, computed as follows:  Proceeds of sale of notes...........................  ........   $13,000 Selling price of property...........................   $20,000 Cost of property....................................    10,000</p><p class="depth3">----------</p><p class="depth3">Total profit......................................    10,000</p><p class="depth3">Total contract price..............................    20,000</p><p class="depth3">========== Percent of profit, or proportion of each payment</p><p class="depth3">returnable as income, $10,000 divided by $20,000,</p><p class="depth3">50 percent.

Suppose in Example 1 the M Corporation, instead of  selling the notes, distributed them in 1962 to its shareholders as a  dividend, and at the time of such distribution, the fair market value of  the notes was $14,000. The income to be reported for 1962 is $6,500,  computed as follows:  Fair market value of notes....................................   $14,000 Basis of obligation--excess of face value of notes over amount     7,500</p><p class="depth3">of income returnable were the notes satisfied in full</p><p class="depth3">(computed as in Example 1)...................................</p><p class="depth3">=========</p><p class="depth3">Taxable income to be reported for 1962......................     6,500</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition from which no gain or loss is recognized. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Under section 453(d)(4)(A), no gain or loss shall be recognized to a  distributing corporation with respect to the distribution made after  November 13, 1966, of installment obligations if (a) the distribution is  made pursuant to a plan for the complete liquidation of a subsidiary  under section 332, and (b) the basis of the such obligations in the  hands of the distributee is determined under section 334(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 453(d)(4)(B), no gain or loss shall be recognized  to a distributing corporation with respect to the distribution of  installment obligations if the distribution is made, pursuant to   a plan for the complete liquidation of a corporation which meets the  requirements of section 337, under conditions whereby no gain or loss  would have been recognized to the corporation had such installment  obligations been sold or exchanged on the day of the distribution. The  preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that under section  453(d)(1) gain to the distributing corporation would be considered as  gain to which section 341(f)(2), 617(d)(1), 1245(a)(1), 1250(a)(1),  1251(c)(1), 1252(a)(1), or 1254(a)(1) applies, computed under the  principles of the regulations under such provisions.

For the treatment of income  derived from installment obligations received in transactions to which  section 381 (a) is applicable, see section 381(c)(8) and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installment obligations transmitted at death. Where installment  obligations are transmitted at death, see section 691(a)(4) and the  regulations thereunder for the treatment of amounts considered income in  respect of a decedent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Losses. See subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1  of the Code, as to the limitation on capital losses sustained by  corporations and the limitation as to both capital gains and capital  losses of individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of installment obligations to life insurance  companies. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 453(d)(4) and  paragraph (c) of this section or any provision of subtitle A relating to  the nonrecognition of gain, the entire amount of any gain realized on  the disposition of an installment obligation by any person, other than a  life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b)  of Sec. 1.801-3), to a life insurance company or to a partnership of  which a life insurance company is a partner shall be recognized and  treated in accordance with section 453(d)(1) and paragraphs (a) and (b)  of this section. If a corporation which is a life insurance company for  the taxable year was a corporation which was not a life insurance  company for the preceding taxable year, such corporation shall be  treated, for purposes of section 453(d)(1) and this paragraph, as having  transferred to a life insurance company, on the last day of the  preceding taxable year, all installment obligations which it held on  such last day. The gain, if any, realized by reason of the installment  obligations being so transferred shall be recognized and treated in  accordance with section 453(d)(1) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section. Similarly, a partnership of which a life insurance company  becomes a partner shall be treated, for purposes of section 453(d)(1)  and this paragraph, as having transferred to a life insurance company,  on the last day of the preceding taxable year of such partnership, all  installment obligations which it holds at the time such life insurance  company becomes a partner. The gain, if any, realized by reason of the  installment obligations being so transferred shall be recognized and  treated in accordance with section 453(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and paragraphs (a) and (b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of section 453(d)(5) and subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph shall not apply to losses sustained in   connection with the disposition of installment obligations to a life  insurance company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the effective date of the provisions of section 453(d)(5)  and this paragraph, see paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.453-10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application of the provisions of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A, an individual, in a transaction to which section 351  applies, transfers in 1961 certain assets, including installment  obligations, to a new corporation, X, which qualifies as a life  insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)) for the year 1961. A  makes his return on the calendar year basis. Section 453(d)(5) provides  that the nonrecognition provisions of section 351 will not apply to the  installment obligations transferred by A to X Corporation. Therefore,  the entire amount of any gain realized by A on the transfer of the  installment obligations shall be recognized in 1961, with the amount of  any such gain computed in accordance with the provisions of section  453(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The M Corporation did not qualify as a life insurance  company (as defined in section 801(a)) for the taxable year 1958. On  December 31, 1958, it held $60,000 of installment obligations. The M  Corporation qualified as a life insurance company for the taxable year  1959. Accordingly, the M Corporation is treated as having transferred to  a life insurance company, on December 31, 1958, the $60,000 of  installment obligations it held on such date. The gain, if any, realized  by M by reason of such installment obligations being so transferred  shall be recognized in the taxable year 1958, with the amount of any  such gain computed in accordance with the provisions of section  453(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. During its taxable year 1958, none of the partners of the  N partnership qualified as a life insurance company (as defined in  section 801(a)). The N partnership held $30,000 of installment  obligations on December 31, 1958. On July 30, 1959, the O Corporation, a  life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)), became a partner  in the partnership. The N partnership held $50,000 of installment  obligations on July 30, 1959. Pursuant to section 453(d)(5), the N  partnership is treated as having transferred to a life insurance  company, on December 31, 1958, the $50,000 of installment obligations it  held on July 30, 1959. The gain, if any, realized by the N partnership  by reason of such installment obligations being so transferred shall be  recognized in the taxable year 1958, with the amount of any such gain  computed in accordance with the provisions of section 453(d)(1) and  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. In 1960, the P Corporation, in a reorganization  qualifying under section 368(a), transferred certain assets (including  installment obligations) to the R Corporation, a life insurance company  as defined in section 801(a). P realized a loss upon the transfer of the  installment obligations, which was not recognized under section 361.  Pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (c) of this section, no loss  with respect to the transfer of these obligations will be recognized to  P under section 453(d)(1).
