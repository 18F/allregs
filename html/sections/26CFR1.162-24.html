                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, in the case of any  taxpayer who is a state legislator at any time during the taxable year  and who makes an election under section 162(h) for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The taxpayer's place of residence within the legislative  district represented by the taxpayer is the taxpayer's home for that  taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer is deemed to have expended for living expenses (in  connection with the taxpayer's trade or business as a legislator) an  amount determined by multiplying the number of legislative days of the  taxpayer during the taxable year by the greater of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount generally allowable with respect to those days to  employees of the state of which the taxpayer is a legislator for per  diem while away from home, to the extent the amount does not exceed 110  percent of the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal per diem with respect to those days for the  taxpayer's state capital; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer is deemed to be away from home in the pursuit of a  trade or business on each legislative day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Legislative day. For purposes of section 162(h)(1) and this  section, for any taxpayer who makes an election under section 162(h), a  legislative day is any day on which the taxpayer is a state legislator  and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The legislature is in session;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legislature is not in session for a period that is not  longer than 4 consecutive days, without extension for Saturdays,  Sundays, or holidays;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer's attendance at a meeting of a committee of the  legislature is formally recorded; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The taxpayer's attendance at any session of the legislature that  only a limited number of members are expected to attend (such as a pro  forma session), on any day not described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2)  of this section, is formally recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, the distance between the taxpayer's place of residence within the  legislative district represented by the taxpayer and the capitol  building of the state is the shortest of the more commonly traveled  routes between the two points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions and special rules. The following definitions apply  for purposes of section 162(h) and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State legislator. A taxpayer becomes a state legislator on the  day the taxpayer is sworn into office and ceases to be a state  legislator on the day following the day on which the taxpayer's term in  office ends.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Living expenses. Living expenses include lodging, meals, and  incidental expenses. Incidental expenses has the same meaning as in 41  CFR 300-3.1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In session--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the  legislature of which a taxpayer is a member is in session on any day if,  at any time during that day, the members of the legislature are expected  to attend and participate as an assembled body of the legislature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (d)(3):</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. B is a member of the legislature of State X. On Day 1,  the State X legislature is convened and the members of the legislature  are expected to attend and participate. On Day 1, the State X  legislature is in session within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of  this section. B does not attend the session of the State X legislature  on Day 1. However, Day 1 is a legislative day for B for purposes of  section 162(h)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. C, D, and E are members of the legislature of State X. On  Day 2, the State X legislature is convened for a limited session in  which not all members of the legislature are expected to attend and  participate. Thus, on Day 2 the legislature is not in session within the  meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, and Day 2 is not a  legislative day under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, Day  2 is not a day described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. C and D  are the only members who are called to, and do, attend the limited  session on Day 2, and their attendance at the session is formally  recorded. E is not called and does not attend. Therefore, Day 2 is a  legislative day as to C and D under section 162(h)(2)(B) and paragraph  (b)(4) of this section. Day 2 is not a legislative day as to E.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Committee of the legislature. A committee of the legislature is  any group that includes one or more legislators and that is charged with  conducting business of the legislature. Committees of the legislature  include, but are not limited to, committees to which the legislature  refers bills for consideration, committees that the legislature has  authorized to conduct inquiries into matters of public concern, and  committees charged with the internal administration of the legislature.  For purposes of this section, groups that are not considered committees  of the legislature include, but are not limited to, groups that promote  particular issues, raise campaign funds, or are caucuses of members of a  political party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Federal per diem. The Federal per diem for any city and day is  the maximum amount allowable to employees of the executive branch of the  Federal government for living expenses while away from home in pursuit  of a trade or business in that city on that day. See 5 U.S.C. 5702 and  the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time for making election. A taxpayer's election  under section 162(h) must be made for each taxable year for which the  election is to be in effect and must be made no later than the due date  (including extensions) of the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manner of making election. A taxpayer makes an election under  section 162(h) by attaching a statement to the taxpayer's income tax  return for the taxable year for which the election is made. The  statement must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification  number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the taxpayer is making an election under  section 162(h); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information establishing that the taxpayer is a state  legislator entitled to make the election, for example, a statement  identifying the taxpayer's state and legislative district and  representing that the taxpayer's place of residence in the legislative  district is not 50 or fewer miles from the state capitol building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of election. An election under section 162(h) may be  revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. An application for  consent to revoke an election must be signed by the taxpayer and filed  with the submission processing center with which the election was filed,  and must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification  number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the taxpayer is revoking an election under  section 162(h) for a specified year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement explaining why the taxpayer seeks to revoke the  election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of election on otherwise deductible expenses for travel  away from home--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legislative days--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Living expenses. For any  legislative day for which an election under section 162(h) and this  section is in effect, the amount of an electing taxpayer's living  expenses while away from home is the greater of the amount of the living  expenses--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section in connection with  the trade or business of being a legislator; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Otherwise allowable under section 162(a)(2) in the pursuit of  any trade or business of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other expenses. For any legislative day for which an election  under section 162(h) and this section is in effect, the amount of an  electing taxpayer's expenses (other than living expenses) for travel  away from home is the sum of the substantiated expenses, such as  expenses for travel fares, telephone calls, and local transportation,  that are otherwise deductible under section 162(a)(2) in the pursuit of  any trade or business of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> in the pursuit of any trade or business of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cross references. See Sec. 1.62-1T(e)(4) for rules regarding  allocation of unreimbursed expenses of state legislators and section  274(n) for limitations on the amount allowable as a deduction for  expenses for or allocable to meals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>, in taxable  years beginning after April 8, 2010.
