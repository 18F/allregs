In the event that the respondent alleges that credential has been lost, misplaced, stolen, destroyed, or is otherwise beyond his ability to produce, the respondent shall execute a lost document affidavit (Form CG-4363). The Administrative Law Judge shall warn the respondent that a willful misstatement of any material item in such affidavit is punishable as a violation of a Federal criminal statute. (See 18 U.S.C. 1001).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a hearing is continued or delayed, the Administrative Law Judge returns the credential to the respondent: unless a prima facie case has been established that the respondent committed an act or offense which shows that the respondent's service on a vessel would constitute a definite danger to public health, interest or safety at sea.
