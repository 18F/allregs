You also  must keep for one year records of any fuel rating determinations you  made according to Sec. 309.10. If you rely for your certification on a  permanent marking or permanent label attached to the   electric vehicle fuel dispensing system by the manufacturer, you must  not remove or deface the permanent marking or label. The records must be  available for inspection by Federal Trade Commission staff members, or  by persons authorized by FTC.</p><p class="depth0">Duties of Retailers</p>
