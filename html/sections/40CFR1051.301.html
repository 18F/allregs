                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you produce vehicles that are subject to the requirements of  this part, you must test them as described in this subpart, except as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Small-volume manufacturers may omit testing under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We may suspend or revoke your certificate of conformity for  certain engine families if your production-line vehicles or engines do  not meet the requirements of this part or you do not fulfill your  obligations under this subpart (see Sec. Sec.  1051.325 and 1051.340).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other regulatory provisions authorize us to suspend, revoke, or  void your certificate of conformity, or order recalls for engine  families, without regard to whether they have passed these production- line testing requirements. The requirements of this subpart do not  affect our ability to do selective enforcement audits, as described in  part 1068 of this chapter. Individual vehicles and engines in families  that pass these production-line testing requirements must also conform  to all applicable regulations of this part and part 1068 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may use alternate programs for testing production-line  vehicles or engines in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use analyzers and sampling systems that meet the field- testing requirements of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J, but not the  otherwise applicable requirements in 40 CFR part 1065 for laboratory  testing, to demonstrate compliance with emission standards if you double  the minimum sampling rate specified in Sec.  1054.310(b). Use measured  test results to determine whether vehicles or engines comply with  applicable standards without applying a measurement allowance. This  alternate program does not require prior approval but we may disallow  use of this option where we determine that use of field-grade equipment  would prevent you from being able to demonstrate that your vehicles or  engines are being produced to conform to the specifications in your  application for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may ask to use another alternate program for testing  production-line vehicles or engines. In your request, you must show us  that the alternate program gives equal assurance that your products meet  the requirements of this part. We may waive some or all of this  subpart's requirements if we approve your alternate approach. For  example, in certain circumstances you may be able to give us equal  assurance that your products meet the requirements of this part by using  less rigorous measurement methods if you offset that by increasing the  number of test vehicles or engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you certify an engine family with carryover emission data, as  described in Sec.  1051.235(d), and these equivalent engine families  consistently pass the production-line testing requirements over the  preceding two-year period, you may ask for a reduced testing rate for  further production-line testing for that family. The minimum testing  rate is one vehicle or engine per engine family. If we reduce your  testing rate, we may limit our approval to any number of model years. In  determining whether to approve your request, we may consider the number  of vehicles or engines that have failed the emission tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We may ask you to make a reasonable number of production-line  vehicles or engines available for a reasonable time so we can test or  inspect them for compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The requirements of this subpart do not apply to engine families  certified under the provisions of Sec.  1051.630.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Vehicles certified to the following standards are exempt from  the production-line testing requirements of this subpart if no engine  families in the averaging set have family emission limits that are  different than the otherwise applicable standard:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Phase I or Phase 2 standards in Sec.  1051.103</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Phase I standards in Sec.  1051.105</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Phase I standards in Sec.  1051.107.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The standards in Sec.  1051.615.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The standards in Sec.  1051.145.
