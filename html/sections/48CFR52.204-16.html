                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 4.1804(a), use the following provision:</p><p class="depth0">Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting (JUL 2015)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. As used in this provision--</p><p class="depth2">Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An identifier assigned to entities located in the United States  or its outlying areas by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Contractor  and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch to identify a commercial or  Government entity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An identifier assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) or by the NATO Support Agency (NSPA) to entities  located outside the United States and its outlying areas that the DLA  Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch records and maintains in  the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an NCAGE code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Offeror shall enter its CAGE code in its offer with its name  and address or otherwise include it prominently in its proposal. The  CAGE code entered must be for that name and address. Enter ``CAGE''  before the number. The CAGE code is required prior to award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CAGE codes may be obtained via--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) at  www.sam.gov. If the Offeror is located in the United States or its  outlying areas and does not already have a CAGE code assigned, the DLA  Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch will assign a CAGE code  as a part of the SAM registration process. SAM registrants located  outside the United States and its outlying areas shall obtain a NCAGE  code prior to registration in SAM (see paragraph (c)(3) of this  provision).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch. If  registration in SAM is not required for the subject procurement, and the  offeror does not otherwise register in SAM, an offeror located in the  United States or its outlying areas may request that a CAGE code be  assigned by submitting a request at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ cage_welcome.asp.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appropriate country codification bureau. Entities located  outside the United States and its outlying areas may obtain an NCAGE  code by contacting the Codification Bureau in the foreign entity's  country if that country is a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. NCAGE  codes may be obtained from the NSPA if the foreign entity's country is  not a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. Points of contact for  codification bureaus and NSPA, as well as additional information on  obtaining NCAGE codes, are available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/nato/ ObtainCAGE.asp.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional guidance for establishing and maintaining CAGE codes  is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a CAGE Code is required for the immediate owner and/or the  highest-level owner by 52.204-17 or 52.212-3(p), the Offeror shall  obtain the respective CAGE Code from that entity to supply the CAGE Code  to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Do not delay submission of the offer pending receipt of a CAGE  code.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)  [79 FR 31191, May 30, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 38312, July 2, 2015]</p>
