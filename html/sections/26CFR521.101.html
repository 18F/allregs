An enterprise of one of the contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other State merely because it carries on business dealings in such other State through a bona fide commission agent, broker or custodian acting in the ordinary course of his business as such. The fact that an enterprise of one of the contracting States maintains in the other State a fixed place of business exclusively for the purchase of goods or merchandise shall not of itself constitute such fixed place of business a permanent establishment of such enterprise. The fact that a corporation of one contracting State has a subsidiary corporation which is a corporation of the other State or which is engaged in trade or business in the other State shall not of itself constitute that subsidiary corporation a permanent establishment of its parent corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(d)</em> The term ``enterprise of one of the contracting States'' means, as the case may be, ``United States enterprise'' or ``Danish enterprise''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(e)</em> The term ``enterprise'' includes every form of undertaking whether carried on by an individual, partnership, corporation, or any other entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(f)</em> The term ``United States enterprise'' means an enterprise carried on in the United States of America by a resident of the United States of America or by a United States corporation or other entity; the term ``United States corporation or other entity'' means a partnership, corporation or other entity created or organized in the United States of America or under the law of the United States of America or of any State or Territory of the United States of America.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(g)</em> The term ``Danish enterprise'' means an enterprise carried on in Denmark by a resident of Denmark or by a Danish corporation or other entity; the term ``Danish corporation or other entity'' means a partnership, corporation, or other entity created or organized in Denmark or under Danish laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(h)</em> The term ``competent authorities'' means, in the case of the United States, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his authorized representative; and in the case of Denmark, the Chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance (Generaldirektoren for Skattevaesenet) or his authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> In the application of the provisions of the present Convention by one of the contracting States any term not otherwise defined, shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which such term has under its own tax laws.</p><p class="depth0">Article III</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An enterprise of one of the contracting States shall not be subject to taxation in the other contracting State in respect of its industrial and commercial profits unless it is engaged in trade or business in such other State through a permanent establishment situated therein.

Such reduction of the rate to five percent shall not apply if the relationship of the two corporations has been arranged or is maintained primarily with the intention of securing such reduced rate.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII</p><p class="depth0">Interest on bonds, securities, notes, debentures, or on any other form of indebtedness derived from sources within one of the contracting States by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State not having a permanent establishment in the former State shall be exempt from tax by such former State.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII</p><p class="depth0">Royalties and other amounts derived as consideration for the right to use copyrights, patents, designs, secret processes and formulas, trade-marks and other like property (including rentals and like payments in respect of motion picture films) derived from sources within one of the contracting States by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State not having a permanent establishment in the former State shall be exempt from taxation in such former State.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Income from real property (not including interest derived from mortgages and bonds secured by real property) and royalties in respect of the operation of mines, quarries, or other natural resources, shall be taxable only in the contracting State in which such property, mines, quarries, or other natural resources are situated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A resident or corporation of one of the contracting States deriving any such income from sources within the other contracting State may, for any taxable year, elect to be subject to the tax of such other contracting State, on a net basis, as if such resident or corporation were engaged in trade or business within such other contracting State through a permanent establishment therein during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Article X</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Wages, salaries, and similar compensation and pensions paid by one of the contracting States or by any other public authority within that State to individuals residing in the other State shall be taxable only in the former State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Private pensions and life annuities derived from within one of the contracting States and paid to individuals residing in the other contracting State shall be exempt from taxation in the former State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The term ``life annuities'' as used herein means a stated sum payable periodically at stated times during life, or during a specified number of years, under an obligation to make the payments in consideration of a gross sum paid for such obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Article XI</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for labor or personal services, including the practice of the liberal professions, shall be taxable only in the contracting State in which such services are rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of paragraph (1) are, however, subject to the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(a)</em> A resident of Denmark shall be exempt from United States tax upon compensation for labor or personal services if he is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding a total of ninety days during the taxable year and the compensation received for such services does not exceed $3,000 in the aggregate. If, however, his compensation is received for labor or personal services performed as an employee of, or under contract with, a resident or corporation or other entity of Denmark, he will be exempt from United States tax if his stay in the United States does not exceed a total of 180 days during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of paragraph (2)(a) of this Article shall apply mutatis mutandis, to a resident of the United States with respect to compensation for personal services otherwise subject to income tax in Denmark.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of this Article shall have no application to the income to which Article X (1) relates.</p><p class="depth2">Article XII</p><p class="depth2">Gains derived in one of the contracting States from the sale or exchange of capital assets by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State shall be exempt from taxation in the former State if such resident or corporation or other entity is not engaged in trade or business in such former State.
