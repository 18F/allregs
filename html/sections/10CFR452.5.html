A bid also may be submitted for additional incentives for uncovered production volumes at a site where an award was made in an earlier auction round.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All bids must set forth the methodology used to derive the estimates of annual production volumes covered by the bid and the bid shall be calculated on a gasoline equivalent volumetric basis using the lower heating Btu value of the fuel compared to the lower heating Btu value of gasoline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All bids will be confidential until 45 days after the close of the window for submission of bids for the reverse auction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bid evaluation and incentive awards selection procedures include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After DOE evaluates the bids received during the open window, it shall, within 45 days following the close of the open window for submission of bids for the reverse auction, announce on DOE's website and by direct mail the names of the successful bidders and the terms of their bids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE shall issue awards for the bid production amounts beginning with the bidder that submitted the bid for the lowest level of production incentive on a per gallon basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event of a tie among the lowest bids, preference will be given to the lowest tied bidder based on DOE's evaluation of the extent to which the tied bids meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Demonstrates outstanding potential for local and regional economic development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Includes agricultural producers or cooperatives of agricultural producers as equity partners in the ventures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has a strategic agreement in place to fairly reward feedstock suppliers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event more than one lowest tied bid equally meets the standards in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the award will be distributed equally on a per capita basis among those lowest tied bidders meeting the standards.</p>
