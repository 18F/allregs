                                Sec. 19.165  Unit bonds.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unit bond covering operations and withdrawals. If a person is  otherwise required to file bonds for both operations at one or more  distilled spirits plants and withdrawals from one or more distilled  spirits plants, the person may instead submit a single unit bond that  provides all of the guarantees that would otherwise be provided by  separate operations and withdrawal bonds. The unit bond may also provide  coverage for operations at adjacent bonded wine cellars. For purposes of  this section, a person includes a corporation, together with all of its  controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same  meaning as in Sec. 19.163(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required penal sum--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. A person must determine the  penal sum for the unit bond by separately calculating in accordance with  Sec. 19.166, and then totaling, the amounts needed to cover operations  and withdrawals at each individual plant covered by the bond. The penal  sum for the unit bond must not be less than the sum of the minimum penal  sums that would be required if each of the plants had its own bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation between operations and withdrawals. A unit bond must  show separately the amount of coverage provided for operations  (including operations at each adjacent bonded wine cellar if applicable)  and for withdrawals at each distilled spirits plant covered by the bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax liability must not exceed allocated penal sum. If the amount  of the penal sum allocated to operations at, or withdrawals from, a  particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in Sec.  19.166 for a single plant, the tax liability for operations at, or  withdrawals from, that plant must not exceed that allocated amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total penal sum available for each plant. Even when the penal  sum of a unit bond is allocated among multiple plants, the bond must  provide that the total penal amount of the bond will be available to  satisfy any liability incurred under the terms and conditions of the  bond at any plant covered by the bond.
