Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. ONRR may require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must

meet the requirements of this definition for that production month, as well as when the contract was executed.</p><p class="depth0">Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.</p><p class="depth0">BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth0">BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth0">Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.</p><p class="depth0">Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal.

Under this method, costs of transportation, washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at the mine.</p><p class="depth0">Net output means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant produces.</p><p class="depth0">ONRR means the Office of Natural Resources Revenue of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth0">Person means by individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture.</p><p class="depth0">Sales type code means the contract type or general disposition (e.g., arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease.
