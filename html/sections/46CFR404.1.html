Included in this part are explanations of the steps followed in developing a pilotage rate adjustment, the analysis used, and the guidelines followed in arriving at the pilotage rates contained in part 401 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Great Lakes pilotage rates shall be reviewed annually in accordance with the procedures detailed in Appendix C to this part. The Director shall review Association audit reports annually and, at a minimum, the Director shall complete a thorough audit of pilot association expenses and establish pilotage rates in accordance with the procedures detailed in Sec. 404.10 of this part at least once every five years. An interested party or parties may also petition the Director for a review at any time. The petition must present a reasonable basis for concluding that a review may be warranted. If the Director determines, from the information contained in the petition, that the existing rates may no longer be reasonable, a full review of the pilotage rates will be conducted. If the full review shows that pilotage rates are within a reasonable range of their target, no adjustment to the rates will be initiated.
