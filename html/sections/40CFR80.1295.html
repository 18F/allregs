Sec. 80.1275 and 80.1290 may be used interchangeably in all credit use scenarios, subject to the credit life provisions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gasoline benzene credits may be used by a refiner or importer to comply with the gasoline benzene content standard of Sec. 80.1230(a), may be banked by a refiner or importer for future use

or transfer, may be transferred to another refinery or importer within a company (intracompany trading), or may be transferred to another refiner or importer outside of the company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit transfers.

(1)(i) Early credits, per Sec. 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under Sec. 80.1240(a) for any of the following annual averaging periods: 2011, 2102, 2013.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Early credits, per Sec. 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under Sec. 80.1240(a) for any of the following annual averaging periods: 2011, 2102, 2013.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Early credits, per Sec. 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under Sec. 80.1240(a) for any of the following annual averaging periods: 2011, 2102, 2013.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Early credits, per Sec. 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under Sec. 80.1240(a) by small refiners approved under Sec. 80.1340 for any of the following averaging periods: 2015, 2016, 2017.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Standard credits, per Sec. 80.1290, may be used for compliance purposes under Sec. 80.1240(a) within five years from the year they were generated, except as noted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
