                            <p class="depth0">NHTSA may issue to any person, sole proprietorship, partnership,  corporation, or other entity a subpoena requiring the production of  documents or things (subpoena duces tecum) and testimony of witnesses  (subpoena ad testificandum), or both, relating to any matter under  investigation or the subject of any inquiry. Subpoenas are issued by the  Chief Counsel. When a person, sole proprietorship, partnership,  corporation, or other entity is served with a subpoena ad testificandum  under this part, the subpoena will describe with reasonable  particularity the matters on which the testimony is required. In  response to a subpoena ad testificandum, the sole proprietorship,  partnership, corporation, or other entity so named shall designate one  or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who  consent to testify on its behalf, and set forth, for each person  designated, the matters on which he or   she will testify. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters  known or reasonably available to the entity.  [53 FR 26261, July 12, 1988]</p>
