                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Substance of allegations. Although a notarizing officer is generally not responsible for the correctness of the form of an affidavit or the manner in which the allegations therein are set forth (see Sec. 92.11(a) regarding the preparation of legal documents by attorneys; Sec. 92.11(b) regarding the preparation of legal documents by notarizing officers; and Sec. 92.24 regarding the form of an affidavit), he may, in appropriate instances, draw the affiant's attention to the following generally accepted criteria as regards the substance of the allegations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant should be alleged directly and positively. Facts are not to be inferred where the affiant has it in his power to state them positively and fully.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the matters stated in the affiant's affidavit rest upon information derived from others rather than on facts within his personal knowledge, he should aver that such matters are true to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the allegations made on information and belief are material, the sources of information and grounds of belief should be set out and a good reason given why a positive statement could not be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the conclusions of the affiant are drawn from the contents of documents, such contents should be set out or exhibited, so that the authority to whom the affidavit is presented may determine whether the affiant's deductions are well founded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Veracity of allegations. Notarizing officers are not required to examine into the truth of the affiant's allegations or to pass upon any contentious

questions involved. In many instances the matters referred to in an affidavit will be of a technical or special nature beyond the officer's general knowledge or experience. However, he may, in certain circumstances, refuse to take an affidavit. (See Sec. 92.9 regarding the types of situations in which an officer might properly refuse to perform a notarial service; also see Sec. 92.10 regarding the waiver and other statements which may be included in a notarial certificate where evidence exists of falsity in the affiant's declaration.)
