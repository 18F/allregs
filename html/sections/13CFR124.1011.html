                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Format. An SDB protest need not be in any specific format in  order for SBA to consider it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specificity. A protest must be sufficiently specific to provide  reasonable notice as to all grounds upon which the protested concern's  disadvantaged status is challenged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA will dismiss a protest that merely asserts that the  protested concern is not disadvantaged, without setting forth specific  facts or allegations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer must forward to SBA any non-premature  protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is  sufficiently specific or timely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis. SBA will consider a protest challenging whether the  apparent successful offeror is owned and controlled by one or more  socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including whether  one or more of the individuals claiming disadvantaged status is in fact  socially or economically disadvantaged, only if the protest presents  credible evidence that the firm's circumstances have materially changed  since SBA certified it as an SDB, or that the firm's SDB application  contained false or misleading information.
