                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-acceptance of submission for review of matchability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  Commission will make an initial review of each submission made under 11  CFR part 9036 to determine if it substantially meets the format  requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2(b) and the Federal Election  Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. If the Commission  determines that a submission does not substantially meet these  requirements, it will not review the matchability of the contributions  contained therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For submissions made in the year before the Presidential  election year (other than submissions made on the last submission date  in that year), and submissions made after the candidate's date of  ineligibility, the Commission will stop reviewing the submission once  the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of  the amount requested, as provided in 11 CFR 9036.2 (c) or (d), as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the  Commission will return the submission to the candidate and request that  it be corrected in accordance with the applicable requirements. If the  candidate makes a corrected submission within 5 business days after the  Commission's return of the original, the Commission will review the  corrected submission prior to the next regularly scheduled submission  date, and will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the  candidate is entitled on the regularly scheduled certification date for  the original submission. Corrected submissions made after this five-day  period will be reviewed subsequent to the next regularly scheduled  submission date, and the Commission will certify to the Secretary the  amount to which the candidate is entitled on the next regularly  scheduled certification date. Each corrected submission shall only  contain contributions previously submitted for matching in the returned  submission and no new or additional contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, (c) and  (d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in  Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions  contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize  statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the  Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is  less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission  certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the  amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces  the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a  previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission  will notify the candidate in writing of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the difference between the amount requested and  the amount to be certified by the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of each contribution and the corresponding  contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has  rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if  statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by  type and the reason for rejection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of contributions that have been determined to be  matchable   and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for payment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with  additional documentation or other information in the resubmission of any  rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a  rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment of amount to be certified by Commission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  candidate shall notify the Commission as soon as possible if the  candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) has knowledge that  a contribution submitted for matching does not qualify under 11 CFR  9034.2 as a matchable contribution, such as a check returned to the  committee for insufficient funds or a contribution that has been  refunded, so that the Commission may properly adjust the amount to be  certified for payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate  does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly  scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment  account, prior to each subsequent payment date on which the candidate  receives payments from any previous certification, the Commission may  revise the amount previously certified for payment pursuant to 11 CFR  9034.5(f). The Commission will promptly notify the Secretary and the  candidate of any revision to the amount certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commission audit of submissions. The Commission may determine,  for the reasons stated in 11 CFR part 9039, that an audit and  examination of contributions submitted for matching payment is  warranted. The audit and examination shall be conducted in accordance  with the procedures of 11 CFR part 9039.  [56 FR 34133, July 25, 1991]</p>
