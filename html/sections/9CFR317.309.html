                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in  relation to a serving as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``serving'' or ``serving size'' means an amount of  food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age  or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is  appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or  processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size  means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by  infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age,  respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of  this section and for products that are intended for weight control and  are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance  program, serving size declared on a product label shall be determined  from the ``Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion-- General Food Supply'' (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in Sec.  317.312(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For  products that are both intended for weight control and available only  through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the  serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such  products must bear a statement, ``for sale only through the ___  program'' (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight- control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display  panel. However, the Reference Amounts in Sec. 317.312(b) shall be used  for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are  available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition  claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be  on the basis of the product ``as packaged'' for all products, except  that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat  products described in Sec. 317.301 may be declared on the basis of the  product ``as consumed''. For single-ingredient, raw products that are  not ground or chopped meat products described in Sec. 317.301, if data  are based on the product `as consumed,' the data must be presented in  accordance with Sec. 317.345(d). In addition to the required  declaration on the basis of ``as packaged'' for products other than  single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat  products described in Sec. 317.301, the declaration may also be made on  the basis of ``as consumed,'' provided that preparation and cooking  instructions are clearly stated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For products in discrete units (e.g., hot dogs, and individually  packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products  which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed  together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in  discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and barbecue sauce), the serving  size shall be declared as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the  serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely  approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent  of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two  units as the serving size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent  of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount,  the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole  unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or  milliliter) or   larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a  unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the  Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the  individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and  presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as  the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and  barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units  represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients  used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined  in Sec. 317.312(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For packages containing several individual single-serving  containers, each of which is labeled with all required information  including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are  labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers),  the serving size shall be 1 unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For products in large discrete units that are usually divided  for consumption (e.g., pizza), for unprepared products where the entire  contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are  usually divided for consumption (e.g. pizza kit), and for products which  consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed  together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a  large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size  shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g., \1/8\  quiche, \1/4\ pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount  for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the  package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product  determined in Sec. 317.312(d) or the fraction of the large discrete  unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor  ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product  determined in Sec. 317.312(c). In expressing the fractional slice,  manufacturers shall use \1/2\, \1/3\, \1/4\, \1/5\, \1/6\, or smaller  fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole roast beef, marinated  beef tenderloin, large can of chili), and for products which consist of  two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where  the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product  (e.g., roast beef and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in  household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount  for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product  represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients  used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in  Sec. 317.312(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(iv)</em>, (v), and (vi) of this section, the following  rules shall be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible  and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in \1/4\- or \1/3\-cup  increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities  less than \1/4\ cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp),  1, 1\1/3\, 1\1/2\, or 1 \2/3\ tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but  greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of  teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1  teaspoon (tsp), and in \1/4\-tsp increments for quantities less than 1  tsp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units  such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece,  slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used.  Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most  closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by  the use of the term ``about'' (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the individual container or package shall be  used for   single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within  multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A  description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in  discrete units (e.g., chop, slice, link, or patty).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package  is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for  consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package  may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients  or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., ham  with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each  component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in  accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5  milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz  in weight means 28 grams (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in  Sec. 317.312(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls  exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp),  manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental  size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A product that is packaged and sold individually and that  contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall  be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content  of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that  have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may  decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less  than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages  sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable  Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire  content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating  occasion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size  expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)  through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent  metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other  foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric  quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on  the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition  information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph  (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides  the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single-servings,  then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size  declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration  provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household  measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for  quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2  and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL)  quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL)  increments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in  parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where  other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving  size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced bologna. The ounce quantity  equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz  increments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the  following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for  teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Determination of the number of servings per container shall be  based on the serving size of the product determined by following the  procedures described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole  number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and  random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings  shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving.   Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term ``about'' (e.g.,  about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained  solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural  variation in unit size (e.g., pickled pigs feet), the manufacturer may  state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5  servings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare  ``varied'' for the number of servings per container provided the  nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in  ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in  parenthesis following the ``varied'' statement (e.g., varied  (approximately 8 servings per pound)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For packages containing several individual single-serving  containers, each of which is labeled with all required information  including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are  labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers),  the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within  the total package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For packages containing several individually packaged multi- serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying  the number of individual multi-serving units in the total package by the  number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the  number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition  labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or  chopped meat products described in Sec. 317.301, including those that  have been previously frozen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be  on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of  single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat  products described in Sec. 317.301 and products that are packed or  canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not  customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component  content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily  consumed shall be based on the drained solids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products  as defined in Sec. 317.313(l) and Sec. 317.313(m) in single-serving  containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving  size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve  containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the  product in Sec. 317.312(b) if the product is listed in Sec.  317.312(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products  in multi-serve containers that are not listed in Sec. 317.312(b) will  be based on the reference amount according to Sec. 317.312(c), (d), and  (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient  and food component information in the same format as required by Sec.  317.309(e),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as  packaged or purchased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units  in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> If a product consists of assortments of meat or meat food  products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content  shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual  product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is  cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such  combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may  be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as  consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled  with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another  set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving  of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)):  Provided, That the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be  added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and  other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in  labeling of a   meat or meat food product shall contain information about the level of  the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and  the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph.  No nutrients or food components other than those listed in this  paragraph as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the  nutrition label. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) or (g) of this  section, nutrient information shall be presented using the nutrient  names specified and in the following order in the formats specified in  paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Calories, total,'' ``Total calories,'' or ``Calories'': A  statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest  5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie  increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories  may be expressed as zero. Energy content per serving may also be  expressed in kilojoule units, added in parenthesis immediately following  the statement of the caloric content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods.

Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant  amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is  placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is  followed by the statement ``Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily  Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in  Sec. 317.400(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the  simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in  paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required  in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote  is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label  followed by the statement ``Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000  calorie diet'' and, if the term ``Daily Value'' is not spelled out in  the heading, a statement that ``DV'' represents ``Daily Value.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to  bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of  paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and Sec. 317.302(a) by one  or more of the following means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or  linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the  product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than  12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available  to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or  size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on  any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion  only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular  display.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the  nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a  hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative  amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both  principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding  is required only on the title ``Nutrition Facts'' and is allowed for  nutrient names for ``Calories,'' ``Total fat,'' ``Cholesterol,''  ``Sodium,'' ``Total carbohydrate,'' and ``Protein.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Using any of the following abbreviations:  Serving size--Serv size Servings per container--Servings Calories from fat--Fat cal Calories from saturated fat--Sat fat cal Saturated fat--Sat fat Monounsaturated fat--Monounsat fat Polyunsaturated fat--Polyunsat fat Cholesterol--Cholest Total carbohydrate--Total carb Dietary fiber--Fiber Soluble fiber--Sol fiber Insoluble fiber--Insol fiber Sugar alcohol--Sugar alc Other carbohydrate--Other carb</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Omitting the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this  section and placing another asterisk at the bottom of the label followed  by the statement   ``Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet'' and, if the  term ``Daily Value'' is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that  ``DV'' represents ``Daily Value.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Presenting the required nutrition information on any other label  panel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that  are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer  units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as  nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or  marking, constitutes a production lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of  a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot.  Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a  composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be  representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be  individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the  units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the  results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be  considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All  analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used  by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the ``Chemistry  Laboratory Guidebook,'' or, if no USDA method is available and  appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in  accordance with the 1990 edition of the ``Official Methods of Analysis''  of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical  Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a  particular method of analysis is specified in Sec. 317.309(c), or, if  no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by  other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by  the Agency. The ``Official Methods of Analysis'' is incorporated as it  exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was  approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5  U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. If any  ingredient which contains a naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrient is  added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food  product is subject to Class II requirements unless the same nutrient is  also added, which would make the total amount of such nutrient subject  to Class I requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A product with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral,  protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate,  polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium shall be deemed to  be misbranded under section 1(n) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21  U.S.C. 601(n)(1)) unless it meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Class I vitamin, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium.  The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for  that nutrient declared on the label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Class II vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary  fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or  potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80  percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label; Provided,  That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient  value which falls below this level by an amount less than the  variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that  product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a  product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A product with a label declaration of calories, sugars, total  fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be  misbranded under section   1(n) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1)) if the  nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess  of the value for that nutrient declared on the label; Provided, That no  regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value  which falls above this level by an amount less than the variability  generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at  the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The amount of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate,  dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated  fat, or potassium may vary over labeled amounts within good  manufacturing practice. The amount of calories, sugars, total fat,  saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium may vary under labeled amounts  within good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the  label statement of serving size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The management of the establishment must maintain records to  support the validity of nutrient declarations contained on product  labels. Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any  duly authorized representative of the Agency upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The compliance provisions set forth in paragraph (h) (1) through  (8) of this section shall not apply to single-ingredient, raw meat  products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in Sec.  317.301, including those that have been previously frozen, when  nutrition labeling is based on the most current representative data base  values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released  form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference as  provided in Sec. 317.345(e) and (f).
