                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fee acquisition offer form. The use of the latest revision of ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, is required in all authorized projects, except in those cases where agreements with the landowners can be fully reflected in an executed deed, and where the provisions of Sec. Sec. 644.81(c), 644.82(a), and 664.86 are not applicable or can be fully complied with without the use of an Offer to Sell. When an agreement as to terms has been reached with the owner, or a counteroffer has been received which will be considered for acceptance or submitted for consideration by higher authority, a draft of the offer will be prepared, with particular attention to the following instructions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No changes or interlineations in the printed portions of the offer form will be permitted, unless authorized by the Chief of Engineers, except where the words ``general warranty deed'' are changed to another form of deed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insert legal land description of property to be acquired, or attach description by Exhibits to be identified on page 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The word ``none'' should be inserted in the blank spaces following the first and third lines, respectively, on page 2 of the offer form when title is being acquired free and clear of all rights outstanding in third parties and the vendor is not permitted to except or reserve any right or interest in the property to be conveyed to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Particular attention is directed to Sec. 644.86, regarding exceptions and reservations and outstanding rights in third parties. No exceptions or reservations of crops, timber, buildings and improvements, subsurface rights, or any other interest will be incorporated in any offer to sell unless the required approvals have first been obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In any case where the offer form deviates from the standard approved forms or contains any conditions, exception, or reservation contrary to these instructions, the assembly will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration with the recommendations of the Division and District Engineer. This may be done at the same time a counteroffer is submitted to DAEN-REA in accordance with Sec. 644.84(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The landowner's name will be set forth in the offer in the exact way in which it appears on record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When it is necessary for a corporate agent, fiduciary, or any person other than an individual owner to execute the offer, satisfactory evidence of the authority to act for the owner must be attached to each of the copies of the Offer to Sell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where it is necessary to attach sheets to the offer in order to fully set forth the terms of reservations, exceptions, or outstanding rights in third parties, such additional sheets must be securely attached and initialed by all parties signing the Offer to Sell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The name and address of the person or persons to whom notice of acceptance is to be sent must be accurately set forth. The address where the landowner can be reached after he vacates the property, if different from the address to which the notice is to be sent, should be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission, acceptance, and distribution of offers to sell. (1) For each purchase transaction, the original offer and four copies will be signed by the landowner and spouse, if any. A copy (5th) will be left with the landowner when the offer is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each purchase transaction, the original offer and four copies will be signed by the landowner and spouse, if any. A copy (5th) will be left with the landowner when the offer is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Division and District Engineers, the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions, and the incumbents of the position to

which authority is delegated as provided in Sec. 644.84(d) are authorized to accept offers to sell for the acquisition of land or interests in land and easements, licenses, permits, or similar acquisition instruments: Provided, The price set forth in the instrument is within their authority to approve or has been approved in writing by higher authority. The Division or District Engineer may also delegate to Project Managers (including the heads of any field offices with responsibility for real estate acquisition) authority to execute real estate instruments by which land or interests in land are acquired by agreement with landowners, provided the consideration set forth in the instrument is within the approved appraised value or has been approved as provided in Sec. 644.84(c). Upon approval of the offer or other instrument requiring payment to the landowner, a determination that necessary funds are available, and acceptance of the instrument under the authority contained in this subparagraph, the instrument will be numbered in conformity with existing regulations and will immediately be distributed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Original offers to sell will be retained at the Division or District for site audit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Send signed copy to vendor as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Attached conformed copy to title assembly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> File signed copy with project records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon acceptance of the Offer to Sell, the Division or District Engineer will notify the vendor by transmitting a signed copy of the contract (accepted offer) to vendor by ENG Form 53, Notice of Acceptance of Offer to Sell Real Property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon acceptance of the Offer to Sell, the Division or District Engineer will notify the using service, in the case of military acquisition, that the Offer to Sell has been accepted and that the Government has ``the right of immediate occupancy and use of the land,'' subject to the terms of the accepted offer. The land should be clearly identified to the using service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Instruments which do not provide for payments to landowners will be distributed in accordance with regulations governing such cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Easement acquisition offer form. (1) The use of ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, is required for the acquisition of all types of easement estates, such as flowage, spoil, drainage, road, railroad, utility, restrictive or safety (Army and Air Force), clearance (Air Force), and other required easement acquisitions, except in those cases where agreements with landowners can be fully reflected in an executed deed, and where the provisions of Sec. Sec. 644.84(b) and 644.86(d) are not applicable or can be fully complied with without the use of an Offer to Sell. Pages 1 and 2 of ENG Form 2970, containing the terms and conditions of the acquisition, are standard and need no modification. The tract of land in which the particular easement will be acquired will be described in Exhibit ``A,'' and the easement estate will be set forth in Exhibit ``B'' to ENG Form 2970. Division Engineers are authorized to approve deviations in ENG Form 2970 in all cases where the easement does not cost more than $500: Provided, That any deviation from the estates listed in Figure 5-6 of ER 405-1-12, must have the prior approval of DAEN-REA. When easements are being acquired from a vendor from whom fee is also being acquired, ENG Forms 42 and 2970 may be combined into one instrument in order to complete the entire acquisition as one transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, is required for the acquisition of all types of easement estates, such as flowage, spoil, drainage, road, railroad, utility, restrictive or safety (Army and Air Force), clearance (Air Force), and other required easement acquisitions, except in those cases where agreements with landowners can be fully reflected in an executed deed, and where the provisions of Sec.

Normally a license of this nature should be obtained

for a nominal consideration. Occasionally it will be necessary to provide for the payment of a small fee to cover the licensor's engineering and administrative expenses. In such cases, the consideration for the granting of a license will not exceed $100. In cases where the licensor demands a consideration equal to the appraised value of the right to be acquired, consideration will be given to the acquisition of a perpetual easement by condemnation, if the licensor is not vested with authority to grant such an easement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The description of the tract over which an easement is being acquired should be prefaced by terminology similar to that of ENG Form 42 which makes the tract inclusive of the abutting owner's interest in contiguous roads and other easements, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Offer assemblies will be prepared, accepted, and distributed in the same manner as provided for fee acquisition, except that ENG Form 3422, Notice of Acceptance of Offer to Sell Easement, will be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment. After acceptance and distribution of the offer assembly and the acquisition is ready for closing, payment will be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cancellation of contracts. If, for any reason, it is necessary to cancel a contract for acceptance by the Government of the Offer to Sell, the cancellation will be effected by using ENG Form 1572, Agreement for Mutual Cancellation of Contract. Upon execution of this agreement by the landowner and the Division or District Engineer, or the Chief of the Real Estate Division, distribution of the original and copies of the agreement will be the same as for the accepted Offer to Sell.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfer of tracts from purchase to condemnation. If, at any time in the course of acquisition by purchase, it becomes apparent that acquisition by purchase will involve substantial delay or cannot be accomplished, action will be taken to acquire the land by condemnation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Acquisition of land by donation. (1) In cases where the acquisition of real property has been authorized and approved by donation, ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, or ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, will be entered into setting forth the terms and conditions of the donation and conveyance to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases where the acquisition of real property has been authorized and approved by donation, ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, or ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, will be entered into setting forth the terms and conditions of the donation and conveyance to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The offer, when approved and accepted, will be distributed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Title clearance and closing of donation cases are processed in the same manner as any other fee or easement acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Vacation of property by landowners and tenants--(1) Notice to landowners. From the inception of the project, landowners and tenants will be instructed to notify the Division or District Engineer or Real Estate Project Manager, in writing, as soon as they vacate their property; to turn in their keys whenever possible in order that the buildings may be kept under lock; and to keep the Division or District Engineer or Real Estate Project Office advised of any changes in address in order to expedite title clearance, payment, closing action, and the distribution of funds in condemnation proceedings. Landowners and tenants will be informed that, in order to protect their interests, they should not move from their property and that the Government will not require them to surrender possession until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice to landowners.

Where an offer is accepted or a declaration of taking is filed, the individual tracts will have been surveyed and appraised. In condemnation proceedings for possession, there may be cases in which individual tract surveys and appraisals will not have been completed at the time the condemnation proceeding is filed. In such cases, landowners and tenants will not be required to surrender possession, and buildings and improvements will not be removed or destroyed in the conduct of construction work, until individual appraisals have been completed and photographs have been procured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection of property. (i) As soon as a landowner or tenant gives notification that he is vacating his property, or as soon as this information is obtained from any other source, the District Engineer will immediately have a member of his staff make a personal inspection of the property and execute ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property. The inspection will be made with a view of determining whether all buildings, improvements, and crops on the land to be acquired, as listed in the appraisal report, are still on the land and in substantially the same condition as they were on the date of the appraisal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As soon as a landowner or tenant gives notification that he is vacating his property, or as soon as this information is obtained from any other source, the District Engineer will immediately have a member of his staff make a personal inspection of the property and execute ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property.

The second copy will be held for the use of the closing attorneys on purchase cases, or for the use of the local representative of the Department of Justice in condemnation cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Public relations. One of the most difficult problems encountered in the real estate activities of the Department of the Army, particularly from a public relations standpoint, is that of the sudden dislocation of families, tenants as well as owners, and the relocation of these families. Special attention, therefore, will be given to their problems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payment of relocation assistance and acquisition. Public Law 91-646 provides for reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by owners and tenants who are displaced as the result of Federal and federally-assisted programs. Payment of relocation assistance benefits and certain costs incurred by the vendor in transfer of title to the Government and certain litigation expenses incurred by the owner is provided for under that Act.</p>
