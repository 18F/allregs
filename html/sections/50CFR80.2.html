                            <p class="depth0">The terms in this section pertain only to the regulations in this  part.</p><p class="depth0">Acts means the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of  September 2, 1937, as amended (16 U.S.C. 669-669k), and the Dingell- Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act of August 9, 1950, as amended (16  U.S.C. 777-777n, except 777e-1 and g-1).</p><p class="depth0">Agency means a State fish and wildlife agency.</p><p class="depth0">Angler means a person who fishes for sport fish for recreational  purposes as permitted by State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Capital improvement means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A structure that costs at least $10,000 to build; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The alteration, renovation, or repair of a structure if it  increases the structure's useful life or its market value by at least  $10,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An agency may use its own definition of capital improvement if  its definition includes all capital improvements as defined here.</p><p class="depth0">Comprehensive management system is a State fish and wildlife  agency's method of operations that links programs, financial systems,  human resources, goals, products, and services. It assesses the current,  projected, and desired status of fish and wildlife; it develops a  strategic plan and carries it out through an operational planning  process; and it evaluates results. The planning period is at least 5  years using a minimum 15-year projection of the desires and needs of the  State's citizens. A comprehensive-management-system grant funds all or  part of a State's comprehensive management system.</p><p class="depth0">Construction means the act of building or significantly renovating,  altering, or repairing a structure. Acquiring, clearing, and reshaping  land and demolishing structures are types or phases of construction.  Examples of structures are buildings, roads, parking lots, utility  lines, fences, piers, wells, pump stations, ditches, dams, dikes, water- control structures, fish-hatchery raceways, and shooting ranges.</p><p class="depth0">Director means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The person whom the Secretary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Appointed as the chief executive official of the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Delegated authority to administer the Acts nationally; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A deputy or another person authorized temporarily to administer  the Acts nationally.</p><p class="depth0">Diversion means any use of revenue from hunting and fishing licenses  for a purpose other than administration of the State fish and wildlife  agency.</p><p class="depth0">Fee interest means the right to possession, use, and enjoyment of a  parcel of land or water for an indefinite period. A fee interest, as  used in this part, may be the:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fee simple, which includes all possible interests or rights that  a person can hold in a parcel of land or water; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fee with exceptions to title, which excludes one or more real  property interests that would otherwise be part of the fee simple.</p><p class="depth0">Grant means an award of money, the principal purpose of which is to  transfer funds or property from a Federal agency to a grantee to support  or stimulate an authorized public purpose under the Acts. This part uses  the term grant for both a grant and a cooperative agreement for  convenience of reference. This use does not affect the legal distinction  between the two instruments. The meaning of grant in the terms grant  funds, grant-funded, under a grant, and under the grant includes the  matching cash and any matching in-kind contributions in addition to the  Federal award of money.</p><p class="depth0">Grantee means the State fish and wildlife agency that applies for  the grant and carries out grant-funded activities in programs authorized  by the Acts. The State fish and wildlife agency acts on behalf of the  State government, which is the legal entity and is accountable for the  use of Federal funds, matching funds, and matching in-kind  contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Lease means an agreement in which the owner of a fee interest  transfers to a lessee the right of exclusive possession and use of an  area of land or water for a fixed period, which may be renewable. The  lessor cannot readily revoke the lease at his or her discretion. The  lessee pays rent periodically or as a single payment. The lessor must be  able to regain possession of the lessee's interest (leasehold interest)  at the end of the lease term. An agreement that does not correspond to  this definition is not a lease even if it is labeled as one.</p><p class="depth0">Match means the value of any non-Federal in-kind contributions and  the portion of the costs of a grant-funded project or projects not borne  by the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0">Personal property means anything tangible or intangible that is not  real property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Tangible personal property includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Objects, such as equipment and supplies, that are moveable  without substantive damage to the land or any structure to which they  may be attached;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Soil, rock, gravel, minerals, gas, oil, or water after  excavation or extraction from the surface or subsurface;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Commodities derived from trees or other vegetation after  harvest or separation from the land; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Annual crops before or after harvest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Intangible personal property includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Intellectual property, such as patents or copyrights;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Securities, such as bonds and interest-bearing accounts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Licenses, which are personal privileges to use an area of land  or water with at least one of the following attributes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Are revocable at the landowner's discretion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Terminate when the landowner dies or the area of land or water  passes to another owner; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(C)</em> Do not transfer a right of exclusive use and possession of an  area of land or water.</p><p class="depth0">Project means one or more related undertakings in a project-by- project grant that are necessary to fulfill a need or needs, as defined  by a State fish and wildlife agency, consistent with the purposes of the  appropriate Act. For convenience of reference in this part, the meaning  of project includes an agency's fish and wildlife program under a  comprehensive management system grant.</p><p class="depth0">Project-by-project grant means an award of money based on a detailed  statement of a project or projects and other supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth0">Real property means one, several, or all interests, benefits, and  rights inherent in the ownership of a parcel of land or water. Examples  of real property include fee and leasehold interests, conservation  easements, and mineral rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A parcel includes (unless limited by its legal description) the  air space above the parcel, the ground below it, and anything physically  and firmly attached to it by a natural process or human action. Examples  include standing timber, other vegetation (except annual crops),  buildings, roads, fences, and other structures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A parcel may also have rights attached to it by a legally  prescribed procedure. Examples include water rights or an access  easement that allows the parcel's owner to travel across an adjacent  parcel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The legal classification of an interest, benefit, or right  depends on its attributes rather than the name assigned to it. For  example, a grazing ``lease'' is often a type of personal property known  as a license, which is described in the definition of personal property  in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Regional Director means the person appointed by the Director to be  the chief executive official of one of the Service's geographic Regions,  or a deputy or another person temporarily authorized to exercise the  authority of the chief executive official of one of the Service's  geographic Regions. This person's responsibility does not extend to any  administrative units that the Service's Headquarters supervises directly  in that geographic Region.</p><p class="depth0">Secretary means the person appointed by the President to direct the  operation of the Department of the Interior, or a deputy or another  person who is temporarily authorized to direct the operation of the  Department.</p><p class="depth0">Service means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><p class="depth0">Sport fish means aquatic, gill-breathing, vertebrate animals with  paired fins, having material value for recreation in the marine and  fresh waters of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">State means any State of the United States, the Commonwealths of  Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories of  Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. State also includes  the District of Columbia for purposes of the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish  Restoration Act, the Sport Fish Restoration program, and its  subprograms. State does not include the District of Columbia for  purposes of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the  programs and subprogram under the Act because the Pittman-Robertson  Wildlife Restoration Act does not authorize   funding for the District. References to ``the 50 States'' apply only to  the 50 States of the United States and do not include the Commonwealths  of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of  Columbia, or the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and  American Samoa.</p><p class="depth0">State fish and wildlife agency means the administrative unit  designated by State law or regulation to carry out State laws for  management of fish and wildlife resources. If an agency has other  jurisdictional responsibilities, the agency is considered the State fish  and wildlife agency only when exercising responsibilities specific to  management of the State's fish and wildlife resources.</p><p class="depth0">Subaccount means a record of financial transactions for groups of  similar activities based on programs and subprograms. Each group has a  unique number. Different subaccounts also distinguish between benefits  to marine or freshwater fisheries in the programs and subprograms  authorized by the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act.</p><p class="depth0">Useful life means the period during which a federally funded capital  improvement is capable of fulfilling its intended purpose with adequate  routine maintenance.</p><p class="depth0">Wildlife means the indigenous or naturalized species of birds or  mammals that are either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Wild and free-ranging;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Held in a captive breeding program established to reintroduce  individuals of a depleted indigenous species into previously occupied  range; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Under the jurisdiction of a State fish and wildlife agency.  [76 FR 46156, Aug. 1, 2011, as amended at 78 FR 35152, June 12, 2013]</p>
