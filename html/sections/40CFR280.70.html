Subparts E and F must be complied with if a release is  suspected or confirmed. However, release detection is not required as  long as the UST system is empty. The UST system is empty when all  materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no  more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue, or 0.3 percent by  weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an UST system is temporarily closed for 3 months or more,  owners and operators must also comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Leave vent lines open and functioning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cap and secure all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary  equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When an UST system is temporarily closed for more than 12  months, owners and operators must permanently close the UST system if it  does not meet either performance standards in Sec.  280.20 for new UST  systems or the upgrading requirements in Sec.  280.21, except that the  spill and overfill equipment requirements do not have to be met. Owners  and operators must permanently close the substandard UST systems at the  end of this 12-month period in accordance with Sec. Sec.  280.71-280.74,  unless the implementing agency provides an extension of the 12-month  temporary closure period. Owners and operators must complete a site  assessment in accordance with Sec.  280.72 before such an extension can  be applied for.</p>
