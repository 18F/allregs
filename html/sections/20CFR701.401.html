Accordingly, not withstanding any contrary state law, claims by any of the categories of workers excluded under Sec. 701.301 or 702.171 must be made to and processed by the state and a merit decision denying coverage on jurisdictional grounds must be made before coverage or benefits under the Act may be sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The time for filing notice and claim under the Act (see subpart B of part 702) does not begin to run for purposes of claims by those workers or dependents described in Sec. 701.301(a)(12) and Sec. 702.171, until a final adverse decision denying coverage under a state compensation act is received.
