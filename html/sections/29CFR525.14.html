The Administrator will make available, upon request, posters in other formats such as Braille or recorded tapes. Such a poster will explain, in general terms, the conditions under which special minimum wages may be paid and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the employer's premises where it may be readily observed by the workers with disabilities, the parents and guardians of such workers, and other workers. Where an employer finds it inappropriate to post such a notice, this requirement may be satisfied by providing the poster directly to all employees subject to its terms.</p>
