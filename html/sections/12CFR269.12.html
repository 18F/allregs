Sec.  269b.110  Charges.</p><p class="depth0">A charge that any bank or labor organization, or agents or representatives of a bank or labor organization, has engaged in or is engaging in any act prohibited under Sec.  269.6 of the policy or has failed to take any action required by Sec.  269.6 of the policy may be filed by any party in interest, or its representative, within 60 days after the alleged violations or within 60 days after the charging party has become or should have become aware of the alleged violation.


Sec.  269b.111  Filing of charges.</p><p class="depth0">Any charge pursuant to Sec.  269b.110 shall be in writing and signed. An original and three copies of such charge, together with one copy for each charged party named, shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the Federal Reserve System Labor Relations Panel, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20551. Within 5 days after receipt of a properly filed charge that meets the formal requirements set forth in Sec.  269b.112, the Secretary will cause a copy of such charge to be served on each party against whom the charge is made and upon all other potential parties in interest.


Sec.  269b.112  Contents of the charge.</p><p class="depth0">A charge shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The full name, address, and telephone number of the person, bank, or labor organization making the charge (hereinafter referred to as the charging party) and of the person signing the charge who shall state also his relation to or his capacity with the complainant. Where discrimination is alleged, all known discriminatees shall be named;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the bank or labor organization against whom the charge is made (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) and of any parties in interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting the alleged unfair labor practice, including the time and place of occurrence of the particular acts, and a statement of the portion or portions of the policy alleged to have been violated. A charge shall not incorporate by reference affidavits or other documents submitted in support of the charge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A statement of the relief sought;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A statement of any other remedies invoked for the redress of the alleged violations of the policy and the results, if any, of their invocation. If the issue in such charge is subject to an established grievance procedure, the complainant must irrevocably elect, prior to the completion of the first applicable step of the grievance procedure, whether he will invoke the grievance procedure or whether he will invoke the unfair labor practice procedures of the panel. A charge which is withdrawn or rejected by the panel as defective prior to the institution of any formal proceedings by the panel shall not prejudice the filing of a grievance on the same matter, unless the parties otherwise so provide;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A declaration by the person signing the charge, that its contents are true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, such declaration to be subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001).


Sec.  269b.113  Withdrawal or settlement.</p><p class="depth0">A charge may be withdrawn or settlement of the matter may be reached without consent of the panel at any time. In connection with any such settlement the parties in interest shall prepare and sign a settlement agreement which shall record that the settlement is mutually satisfactory, shall stipulate any occurrences which constituted unfair labor practices and shall set forth the terms of the settlement.


Sec.  269b.120  Answer to a charge.</p><p class="depth0">The respondent shall file an answer to the charge with the Secretary of the panel within 15 days after service of the charge. Upon application and for good cause shown, the panel may extend the time within which the answer shall be filed. One copy of the answer shall be served on each party with proof of service furnished to the Secretary, and the original, which shall be signed, and four copies shall be filed with the Secretary.


Sec.  269b.121  Contents of answer.</p><p class="depth0">The answer shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A specific admission or denial, and where appropriate, explanation thereof; or if the respondent is without knowledge of the allegation, he shall so state and such statement shall operate as a denial. Admissions or denials may be to all or part of an allegation but shall be responsive to the substance of the allegation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A specified, detailed statement of any affirmative defense;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A clear and concise statement of the facts and matters of law relied upon constituting the grounds of defense.
Any allegation of the charge not denied in the answer may be deemed admitted and may be so found by the panel.</p><p class="depth0">Preliminary Investigation


Sec.  269b.210  Referral to National Center for Dispute Settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within 5 days after the answer to the charge has been or should have been filed, the panel may refer the matter, accompanied by a general or particularized request, to the National Center for Dispute Settlement of the American Arbitration Association (hereinafter referred to as the Center) to make an investigation and to determine whether the charging party has established a prima facie case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of this part, a prima facie case means a case where allegations of an unfair labor practice that have been presented give reasonable cause to believe that such practice may have occurred, but where evidentiary proceedings are necessary for determination of whether the allegations are substantiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Center may use its own personnel or may hire individuals on a contract basis to conduct such investigations. The panel may consolidate or sever proceedings conducted pursuant to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any party may request the Center or other appointing authority to withdraw appointment of the investigator within 3 days after designation on the basis of previously demonstrated personal bias, conflict of interest, or prejudice. Such a request shall set forth in detail the matter alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. Denial of a request by the Center or other appointing authority shall be substantiated in writing and transmitted to the requesting party, and shall be submitted to the panel together with the complete report of the investigator required in Sec.  269b.240(b).


Sec.  269b.220  Priority; acceleration of proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A charge of ``refusal to bargain'' or a charge that, if sustained, would require the setting aside of an election or the conduct of a new election shall be given priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The parties, individually or jointly, may petition the panel at any time to invoke immediately the formal hearing procedures set forth in Sec.  269b.410. They may also petition the panel to entertain the matter itself without prior investigation and/or without the formal hearing procedure set forth in Sec.  269b.410. The panel is empowered also on its own motion to so accelerate disposition of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Before accelerating a case the panel may utilize whatever proceedings it may deem appropriate and timely to allow parties in interest to comment on the proposed course of action.


Sec.  269b.230  Assessment of costs; posting of bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The panel shall normally bear the costs of an investigation conducted pursuant to Sec.  269b.210, but the panel may require that the charging party, the respondent, and/or other parties in interest or intervenors, or several of them, shall bear a portion or all of the costs therefor. With respect to each case where an investigation is directed by the panel, the charging party may, in the discretion of the panel, be required to file a cost bond, or equivalent security, of $500, unless the panel fixes a different amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Among the circumstances that may be the basis for payment of costs by other than the panel are cases where a clearly spurious charge has been filed or where the filing of a charge was necessary to redress the respondent's flagrant misconduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The bond or equivalent security shall be to secure the payment of the costs of the investigation as may be assessed by the panel. In those cases where the panel does not assess such costs, the bond posted and the cost thereof shall be reimbursed to the charging party. The panel may require also the posting of a cost bond by the respondent or other party to the proceeding, who shall be entitled to reimbursement of the cost of the bond in the event that no costs of investigation are assessed upon such party by the panel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notification of the panel's decision that a bond shall be required shall be effected by registered mail, such notice to advise of the amount of the bond required and the period by which it shall be posted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Absent good cause shown, failure of a party to file timely such cost bond or equivalent security may be ground for dismissal or other administrative sanctions deemed appropriate by the Panel.


Sec.  269b.240  The investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the investigation is (1) to ascertain, analyze, and apply the relevant facts in order to determine whether or not formal proceedings are warranted and (2) to assist, by mediation and other appropriate means, the parties to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issues as an alternative to the hearing process. In so doing, the investigator is not limited to the allegations set forth in the charge and may advise the charging party to amend his charge. In addition, he should adduce facts pertaining to the remedy as well as to the alleged violation. Investigation should also adduce facts pertaining to the jurisdiction of the panel and the timeliness of the charge. If the charge is untimely on its face, no investigation shall be required except to determine whether or not attending circumstances warrant waiving the time requirements, set forth in Sec.  269b.110.

The investigator may request the appearance of parties and witnesses, may cause, the production of relevant document, and may take or cause depositions to be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When the investigation has been completed, the Center shall issue a written determination whether the charging party has established a prima facie case, whether the charge was timely filed, and whether the charge is within the jurisdiction of the panel, and reasons therefor. This determination shall be served upon the panel and all parties. The panel shall receive also the complete report of the investigator.</p><p class="depth0">Appeal From the Center's Determination


Sec.  269b.310  Appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0">Where the investigator has found that a prima facie case does not exist, a party, including an intervenor but excluding the respondent or other parties having the same interest as the respondent, within 5 days after receiving the Center's determination may petition the panel to set aside the determination and to cause formal proceedings, set forth in Sec.  269b.410, to be invoked. The panel may grant such petition only on grounds that the Center or its agents were arbitrary, capricious, or acted contrary to law or the policy, or that the investigator's determination is clearly erroneous. The filing requirements for such a petition shall be the same as that for the filing of a charge, as set forth in Sec.  269b.111.


Sec.  269b.320  Proceedings before the panel.</p><p class="depth0">The panel shall issue its decision within 15 days after the receipt of the petition provided for in Sec.  269b.310 or by the end of that period shall announce that it will require briefs by the parties. Such announcement shall specify the requirements as to contents of the briefs, and the time for submission, which shall vary to meet the circumstances of the matter appealed. The panel, at such time, may also require oral argument or the production of evidence or may so order oral argument and/or the production of evidence after examination of the briefs. The panel shall issue its final decision within 20 days after briefs have been filed, evidence has been produced, or oral argument has been conducted.</p><p class="depth0">Formal Proceedings


Sec.  269b.410  Notice of hearing.</p><p class="depth0">If formal proceedings are found to be needed under the above procedures, and if no satisfactory settlement has been reached within 5 days after finding that a prima facie case exists, the Secretary of the panel, unless there is cause for granting an extension of time, shall issue and cause to be served upon the parties a notice of hearing. The panel shall appoint, pursuant to Sec.  269b.420, a hearing officer to hold a hearing and issue a report to the panel containing findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations including, where appropriate, remedial action to be taken and notices to be posted. The Secretary shall furnish to the hearing officer the investigator's report and all other relevant information in the panel's possession.


Sec.  269b.420  Designation of hearing officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The panel, absent special circumstances, shall employ the center to select the hearing officer to conduct the hearing at a site most convenient to the parties and witnesses. The individual who performed the investigation, pursuant to Sec.  269b.210, shall be barred from acting as a hearing officer on the same matter, unless all parties in interest agree to his participation. The selection of the hearing officer, to the extent practicable, shall be done with the concurrence of the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any party may request the hearing officer, at any time following his designation and before the filing of his decision, to withdraw on grounds of previously demonstrated personal bias, conflict of interest, or prejudice by filing with him promptly upon the discovery of the alleged facts a timely affidavit setting forth in detail the matters alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. If, in the opinion of the hearing officer, such affidavit is filed with due diligence and is sufficient on its face, he shall forthwith disqualify himself and withdraw from the

proceeding. If he does not so withdraw, he shall so rule upon the record, stating the grounds for his ruling and proceed with the hearing, or, if the hearing has closed, he shall proceed with the issuance of his decision, and his ruling shall be subject to the same review by the panel that is given to the rest of his decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The costs of conducting the hearing and of the hearing officer shall be borne by the panel. Witness fees and expenses shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear.


Sec.  269b.430  Contents of notice of hearing.</p><p class="depth0">The notice of hearing shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A copy of the charge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A statement of the time of the hearing which shall be not less than 10 days after service of the notice of hearing, except in extraordinary circumstances. All charges involving a ``refusal to bargain'' allegation and all charges, if sustained, that would require the setting aside of an election, or the conducting of a new election shall be given first priority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A statement of the place and nature of hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A reference to the particular section of the policy and rules and regulations of this chapter involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A copy of the determination, if any, made causing the invocation of these formal proceedings.


Sec.  269b.440  Conduct of hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hearing shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer or the panel. An official reporter shall make the only official transcript of such proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Copies of the official transcript will not be provided to the parties, but may be purchased by arrangement with the official reporter or with such costs as the panel may otherwise assess, or may be examined in the offices of the panel and/or the hearing officer subject to such conditions as the panel may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A charging party in asserting that an unfair labor practice has been committed within the meaning of the policy, shall have the burden of proving the allegations of the charge, or the amended charge, by a preponderance of the evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The parties shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, but the hearing officer, may, in his discretion, exclude any evidence or offer of proof if he finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission will either necessitate undue consumption of time or create substantial danger of undue prejudice or confusion.


Sec.  269b.441  Rights of parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any party shall have the right to appear at such hearing in person, by counsel, or by other representative, to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, and to introduce into the record documentary or other relevant evidence, except that the participation of any party shall be limited to the extent permitted by the hearing officer. Five copies of such documentary evidence shall be submitted unless the hearing officer permits a reduced number for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any party shall be entitled, upon request, to a reasonable period at the close of the hearing for oral argument, which shall be included in the stenographic report of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any party shall be entitled to file a brief to the hearing officer within 10 days after the close of the hearing, but no reply brief may be filed except upon special permission of the hearing officer. A party filing a brief must file the original and one copy with the hearing officer along with proof of service of a copy of such brief to all parties. Requests for extension of time to file briefs must be made to the hearing officer who must receive the request at least 3 days prior to the expiration of time fixed for filing of briefs and notice of the request shall be served simultaneously on all other parties, and proof of service shall be furnished. If a request for extension of time is based on the need for a copy of the transcript prior to filing a brief, such request must be made to the hearing officer before the hearing is closed and must be ruled on prior to the close of the hearing.



Sec.  269b.442  Duties and powers of the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth0">The hearing officer shall inquire fully into the facts as to whether the respondent has engaged or is engaging in an unfair labor practice as set forth in the charge or the amended charge.

No such objection shall be deemed waived by further participation in the hearing and such objection shall not stay the conduct of the hearing. Automatic exceptions will be allowed to all adverse rulings and

shall be considered by the panel upon its review of the hearing officer's report and recommendations, if exception to the ruling is included in a statement of exceptions submitted to the panel after the close of the hearing, subject to the requirements of Sec.  269b.520.


Sec.  269b.450  Submission of hearing officer's report to the panel.</p><p class="depth0">After the close of the hearing, and the receipt of briefs, if any, the hearing officer shall prepare a report and recommendations, containing findings of fact, conclusions of law, including judgments as to the credibility of witnesses where appropriate, and the reasons or basis therefor, and recommendations as to the disposition of the case, and, where appropriate, including the remedial action and notices to be posted.

Such submission shall be made within 20 days after the close of the hearing and the receipt of briefs, if any, unless otherwise extended by the panel. The record shall include the charge, notice of hearing, service sheet, motions, rulings, orders, official transcript of the hearing, stipulations, objections, depositions, documentary evidence, exhibits, and any briefs or other documents submitted to the parties.</p><p class="depth0">Panel Review of Hearing Officer's Report and Recommended Decision
