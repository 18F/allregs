                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under section 10 of the Act. This section provides for initial  and subsequent annual adjustments in compensation and continuing  payments to beneficiaries in cases of permanent total disability or  death which commenced or occurred prior to enactment of the 1972  Amendments to this Act (Pub. L. 92-576, approved Oct. 27, 1972). At the  discretion of the Director, such payments may be paid directly by him to  eligible beneficiaries as the obligation accrues, one-half from the  special fund and one-half from appropriations, or he may require  insurance carriers or self-insured employers already making payments to  such beneficiaries to pay such additional compensation as the amended  Act requires. In the latter case such carriers and self-insurers shall  be reimbursed by the Director for such additional amounts paid, in the  proportion of one-half the amount from the special fund and one-half the   amount from appropriations. To obtain reimbursement, the carriers and  self-insurers shall submit claims for payments made by them during  previous periods at intervals of not less than 6 months. A form has been  prescribed for such purpose and shall be used. No administrative claims  service expense incurred by the carrier or self-insurer shall be  included in the claim and no such expense shall be allowed. The amounts  reimbursed to such carrier or self-insurer shall be limited to amounts  actually due and previously paid to beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> or (e), if any,  to be followed by a payment of compensation for 104 weeks, and none  other. The term ``compensation'' herein means money benefits only, and  does not include medical benefits. The procedure for determining the  extent of the employer's (or carrier's) liability under this paragraph  shall be as provided for in the adjudication of claims in subpart C of  this part 702. Thereafter, upon cessation of payments which the employer  is required to make under this paragraph, if any additional compensation  is payable in the case, the district director shall forward such case to  the Director for consideration of an award to the person or persons  entitled thereto out of the special fund. Any such award from the  special fund shall be by order of the Director or Acting Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>, respectively, provide for vocational  rehabilitation of disabled employees, and authorize, under appropriate  circumstances, a maintenance allowance for the employee (not to exceed  $25 a week) in additional to other compensation benefits otherwise  payable for his injury-related disability.   Awards under these sections are made from the special fund upon order of  the Director or his designee. The district directors may be required to  make investigations with respect to any case and forward to the Director  their recommendations as to the propriety and need for such maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under section 39(c)(2) of the Act. In addition to the  maintenance allowance for the employee discussed in paragraph (c) of  this section, the Director is further authorized to use the fund in such  amounts as may be necessary to procure the vocational training services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>,  authorizes payment by the Director from the special fund for special  medical examinations, i.e., those obtained from impartial specialists to  resolve disputes, when such special examinations are deemed necessary  under that statutory provision. The Director has the discretionary  power, however, to charge the cost of such examination to the insurance  carrier or self-insured employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under section 18(b) of the Act. This section, 33 U.S.C. 918(b),  provides a source for payment of compensation benefits in cases where  the employer is insolvent, or other circumstances preclude the payment  of benefits due in any case. In such situations, the district director  shall forward the case to the Director for consideration of an award  from the special fund, together with evidence with respect to the  employer's insolvency or other reasons for nonpayment of benefits due.  Benefits, as herein used, means medical care or supplies within the  meaning of section 7 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 907, and subpart D of this  part 702, as well as monetary benefits. Upon receipt of the case, the  Director shall promptly determine whether an award from the special fund  is appropriate and advisable in the case, having due regard for all  other current commitments from the special fund. If such an award is  made, the employer shall be liable for the repayment into the fund of  the amounts paid therefrom, as provided in 33 U.S.C. 918(b).

No. 96-511)  [38 FR 26861, Sept. 26, 1973, as amended at 49 FR 18294, Apr. 30, 1984;  51 FR 4282, Feb. 3, 1986]</p>
