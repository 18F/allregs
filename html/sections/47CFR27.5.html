The initiating party must secure a bond or establish an escrow account to cover reasonable incremental increase in ongoing expenses that may fall upon the migrated licensee. The bond or escrow account should also account for the possibility that the initiating party subsequently becomes bankrupt.

If involuntary migration is granted, the new facilities must be operational before the initiating party will be permitted to begin its new or modified operations.
