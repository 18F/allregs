                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec.  1.882-1. Section 871(d) (2) and (3) and the provisions of Sec. 1.871-10  thereunder shall apply in respect of an election under section 882(d) in  the same manner and to the same extent as they apply in respect of  elections under section 871(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of Sec. 1.882-1. To the extent that  deductions are connected with interest to which this paragraph applies,  they shall be treated for purposes of section 882(c)(1) and the  regulations thereunder as connected with income which is effectively  connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States by the foreign corporation. An election by the  taxpayer is not required in respect of the income to which this  paragraph applies. For purposes of this paragraph the term ``possession  of the United States'' includes Guam, the Midway Islands, the Panama  Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin  Islands, and Wake Island.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of income. Any income in respect of which an election  described in paragraph (a) of this section is in effect, and any  interest to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, shall be  treated, for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.882-1 and paragraph  (a) of Sec. 1.1441-4, as income which is effectively connected for the  taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States by the foreign corporation. A foreign corporation shall not be  treated as being engaged in trade or business in the United States  merely by reason of having such income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1966. There are no corresponding rules in this part  for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.
