                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Explosive. For the purposes of this subchapter, an explosive  means any substance or article, including a device, which is designed to  function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat)  or which, by chemical reaction within itself, is able to function in a  similar manner even if not designed to function by explosion, unless the  substance or article is otherwise classed under the provisions of this  subchapter. The term includes a pyrotechnic substance or article, unless  the substance or article is otherwise classed under the provisions of  this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Division 1.1 consists of explosives that have a mass explosion  hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load  instantaneously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Division 1.2 consists of explosives that have a projection  hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Division 1.3 consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and  either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but  not a mass explosion hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Division 1.4 consists of explosives that present a minor  explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the  package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is  to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous  explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Division 1.5 \1\ consists of very insensitive explosives. This  division is comprised of substances which have a mass explosion hazard  but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of  initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal  conditions of transport. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ The probability of transition from burning to detonation is  greater when large quantities are transported in a vessel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Division 1.6 \2\ consists of extremely insensitive articles that  do not have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised of  articles that contain only extremely insensitive substances and that  demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or  propagation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ The risk from articles of Division 1.6 is limited to the  explosion of a single article.
