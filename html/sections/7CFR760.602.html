CAT is further specified in parts 402 and 1437 of this title.</p><p class="depth2">Counter-cyclical program payment yield means the weighted average payment yield established under part 1412, subpart C of this title.</p><p class="depth2">County expected yield means an estimated yield, expressed in a specific unit of measure equal to the average of the most recent five years of official county yields established by FSA, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yields, respectively.</p><p class="depth2">Crop insurance indemnity means, for the purpose of this subpart, the net payment to a participant excluding the value of the premium for crop losses covered under crop insurance administered in accordance with FCIA by RMA.</p><p class="depth2">Crop of economic significance means any crop, as defined in this subpart that contributed, or, if the crop is not successfully produced, would have contributed or is expected to contribute, 5 percent or more of the total expected revenue from all of a participant's crops on a farm.</p><p class="depth2">Crop year means as determined by the Deputy Administrator for a commodity on a nationwide basis the calendar year

in which the crop is normally harvested or, where more than one calendar year is involved, the calendar year in which the majority of the crop would have been harvested. For crops on which catastrophic risk protection, as defined in this section, is available, the crop year will be as defined as in such coverage. Crop year determinations by the Deputy Administrator will be final in all cases and, because these are matters of general applicability, will not considered by the Farm Service Agency to be subject to administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth2">Determined acreage or determined production means the amount of acres or production for a farm established by a representative of FSA by use of appropriate means such as official acreage, digitizing and planimetering areas on the photograph or other photographic image, or computations from scaled dimensions or ground measurements.

In the case of aquaculture, except for species for which an Aquaculture Grant Program payment was received, the term ``farm'' includes all acreage used for all aquatic species being produced in all counties that the producer intended to harvest for normal commercial sale. In the case of honey, the term ``farm'' means all bees and beehives in all counties that the participant intended to be harvested for a honey crop for normal commercial sale.</p><p class="depth2">FCIC means the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly owned Government Corporation operated and managed by USDA RMA.</p><p class="depth2">FSA means the Farm Service Agency.</p><p class="depth2">Harvested means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> For insurable crops, harvested is as defined according to the applicable crop insurance policy administered in accordance with FCIA by RMA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> For NAP-covered single harvest crops, a mature crop that has been removed from the field, either by hand or mechanically;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> For noninsurable crops with potential multiple harvests in one year or one crop harvested over multiple years, that the participant has, by hand or mechanically, removed at least one mature crop from the field during the crop year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> For mechanically harvested noninsurable crops, that the mature crop has been removed from the field and placed in or on a truck or other conveyance, except hay is considered harvested when in the bale, whether removed from the field or not. Grazing of land will not be considered harvested for the purpose of determining an unharvested or prevented planting payment factor.</p><p class="depth2">Initial crop means a first crop planted for which assistance is provided under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Insurable crop means an agricultural commodity (excluding livestock) for which the participant on a farm is eligible to obtain a policy or plan of crop insurance administered in accordance with FCIA by RMA. Such a crop for which the participant purchased insurance from RMA is referred to as an insured crop.</p><p class="depth2">Insurance is available means when crop information is contained in RMA's county actuarial documents for a particular crop and a policy or plan of insurance administered in accordance with FCIA by RMA. If the Adjusted Gross Revenue Plan of crop insurance was the only plan of insurance available for the crop in the county in the applicable crop year, insurance is considered not available for that crop. If an AGR plan or a pilot plan was the only plan available, producers are not required to purchase it to meet the risk management purchase requirement, but it will satisfy the risk management purchase requirement. In that case, the other ways to meet the requirement would be, if all the requirements of this subpart are met, a buy-in or NAP.</p><p class="depth2">Intended use means the original use for which a crop or a commodity is grown and produced.</p><p class="depth2">Marketing year means the 12 months immediately following the established final harvest date of the crop of a commodity, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, and not an individual participant's final harvest date.

This is also sometimes referred in this rule as multiple cropping.</p><p class="depth2">NAMP means the national average market price determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 760.640 and 760.641.</p><p class="depth2">NASS is the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.</p><p class="depth2">Noninsurable crop means a commercially produced crop for which the eligible participants on a farm may obtain coverage under NAP.</p><p class="depth2">Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program or NAP means the FSA program carried out under 7 U.S.C. 7333, as specified in part 1437 of this title.</p><p class="depth2">Normal production on the farm means, for purposes of the revenue calculations of this subpart, the sum of the expected revenue for all crops on the farm. It is stated in terms of revenue, because different crops may have different units of measure.</p><p class="depth2">Planted acreage means land in which seed, plants, or trees have been placed, appropriate for the crop and planting method, at a correct depth, into a seed bed that has been properly prepared for the planting method and production practice normal to the area, as determined by the FSA county committee.</p><p class="depth2">Prevented planting means the inability to plant an eligible crop with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of a disaster, as determined by FSA.
