A decision terminating a parolee early from supervision shall also be based on the concurrence of two Commissioners. All other decisions, including decisions on revocation and reparole made pursuant to Sec.  2.105(c), shall be based on the vote of one Commissioner, except as otherwise provided in this subpart.
