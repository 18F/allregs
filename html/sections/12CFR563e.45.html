In assessing whether a savings association's performance is ``outstanding,'' the OTS considers the extent to which the savings association exceeds each of the performance standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in making qualified investments and its performance in providing branches and other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its assessment area(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance overall ratings.
