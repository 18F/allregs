Such  charges may, with the permission of the person receiving the charge, be  served by the   Regional Director by facsimile transmission. In this event the receipt  printed upon the Agency's copy by the Agency's own facsimile machine,  showing the phone number to which the charge was transmitted and the  date and time of receipt shall be proof of service of the same.
