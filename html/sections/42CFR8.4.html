that an OTP is not meeting Federal opioid treatment standards, or if survey of the OTP by the accreditation body otherwise demonstrates one or more deficiencies in the OTP, the accreditation body shall as appropriate either require and monitor corrective action or shall suspend or revoke accreditation of the OTP, as appropriate based on the significance of the deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an accreditation body receives or discovers information that suggests

The accreditation body shall verify that the necessary steps are taken by the OTP within the schedule specified and that all accreditation elements are being substantially met or will be substantially met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this part shall prevent accreditation bodies from granting accreditation, contingent on promised programmatic or performance changes, to OTPs with less substantial violations. Such accreditation shall not exceed 12 months. OTPs that have been granted such accreditation must have their accreditation revoked if they fail to make changes to receive unconditional accreditation upon resurvey or reinspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recordkeeping.

Such summaries shall contain sufficient detail to justify the accreditation action taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accreditation bodies shall provide SAMHSA upon request a list of each OTP surveyed and the identity of all individuals involved in the conduct and reporting of survey results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Accreditation bodies shall submit to SAMHSA the name of each OTP for which the accreditation body accredits conditionally, denies, suspends, or revokes accreditation, and the basis for the action, within 48 hours of the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding any reports made to SAMHSA under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section, each accreditation body shall submit to SAMHSA semiannually, on January 15 and July 15 of each calendar year, a report consisting of a summary of the results of each accreditation survey conducted in the past year.

Accreditation bodies shall obtain SAMHSA's authorization prior to making any substantive (i.e., noneditorial) change in accreditation elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conflicts of interest. The accreditation body shall maintain and apply policies and procedures that SAMHSA has approved in accordance with Sec.  8.3 to reduce the possibility of actual conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, on the part of individuals who act on behalf of the accreditation body.
