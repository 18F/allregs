                                Sec. 701.2  Acquisition of Library material by non-purchase means.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gifts. It is the policy of the Library of Congress to foster the enrichment of its collections through gifts of materials within the terms of the Library's acquisitions policies. In implementing this policy, division chiefs and other authorized officers of the Library may undertake, as representatives of the Library, preliminary negotiations for gifts to the Library. However, responsibility for formal acceptance of gifts of material and for approval of conditions of such gifts rests with The Librarian of Congress or his designee. The Chief, African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, and Chief, European and

Latin American Acquisitions Division are responsible for routine gifts in the geographic areas covered by their divisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deposits. (1) The Anglo-American Acquisitions Division is the only division in the Library authorized to make technical arrangements, formally negotiate for the transportation of materials and conditions of use at the Library, and prepare written Agreements of Deposit to formalize these negotiations. The term ``deposit'' is used to mean materials which are placed in the custody of the Library for general use on its premises, but which remain the property of their owners during the time of deposit and until such time as title in them may pass to the Library of Congress. A deposit becomes the permanent property of the Library when title to it is conveyed by gift or bequest. A deposit may be withdrawn by the owner rather than conveyed to the Library. A deposit shall be accompanied by a signed Agreement of Deposit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Anglo-American Acquisitions Division is the only division in the Library authorized to make technical arrangements, formally negotiate for the transportation of materials and conditions of use at the Library, and prepare written Agreements of Deposit to formalize these negotiations.

In cases where donors wish to attach conditions of use, negotiating officers cannot commit the Library to acceptance of such conditions. The Librarian of Congress or designee will consult the appropriate division and service unit officers and the General Counsel to ascertain whether the conditions are generally acceptable.</p>
