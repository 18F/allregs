                                Sec. 413.81  Direct GME payments: Application of community support
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of determining direct GME payments, the following principles apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Community support. If the community has undertaken to bear the costs of medical education through community support, the costs are not considered GME costs to the hospital for purposes of Medicare payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Redistribution of costs. The costs of training residents that constitute a redistribution of costs from an educational institution to the hospital are not considered GME costs to the hospital for purposes of Medicare payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A hospital must continuously incur costs of direct GME of residents training in a particular program at a training site since the date the residents first began training in that program in order for the hospital to count the FTE residents in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 413.78, 413.79 (c) through (e), and 413.79(k). This rule also applies to providers that are paid for direct GME in accordance with Sec. 405.2468 of this chapter, Sec. 422.270 of this subchapter, and Sec. 413.70.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Effective date. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, payments made in accordance with determinations made under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of

this section will be effective for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective date. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, payments made in accordance with determinations made under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of

this section will be effective for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability for certain hospitals. With respect to an FTE resident who begins training in a residency program on or before October 1, 2003, and with respect to whom there has been a redistribution of costs or community support determined under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the hospital may continue to count the FTE resident until the resident has completed training in that program, or until 3 years after the date the resident began training in that program, whichever comes first.
