                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 16.203-4(c), when contracting by negotiation,  insert a clause that is substantially the same as the following clause  in solicitations and contracts when the conditions specified in 16.203- 4(c)(1)(i) through (iv) apply (but see 16.203-4(c)(2)). The clause may  be modified by increasing the 10-percent limit on aggregate increases  specified in subparagraph (c)(4), upon approval by the chief of the  contracting office.</p><p class="depth0">Economic Price Adjustment--Labor and Material (JAN 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any  time during contract performance, the rates of pay for labor (including  fringe benefits) or the unit prices for material shown in the Schedule  either increase or decrease. The Contractor shall furnish this notice  within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional  period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but not  later than the date of final payment under this contract. The notice  shall include the Contractor's proposal for an adjustment in the  contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b) below, and  shall include, in the form required by the Contracting Officer,  supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and amount of the  increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor's adjustment  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Promptly after the Contracting Officer receives the notice and  data under paragraph (a) above, the Contracting Officer and the  Contractor shall negotiate a price adjustment in the contract unit  prices and its effective date. However, the Contracting Officer may  postpone the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and  decreases in the labor rates (including fringe benefits) and unit prices  of material shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable  under subparagraph (c)(3) below. The Contracting Officer shall modify  this contract (1) to include the price adjustment and its effective date  and (2) to revise the labor rates (including fringe benefits) or unit  prices of material as shown in the Schedule to reflect the increases or  decreases resulting from the adjustment. The Contractor shall continue  performance pending agreement on, or determination of, any adjustment  and its effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any price adjustment under this clause is subject to the  following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect on unit prices of  the increases or decreases in the rates of pay for labor (including  fringe benefits) or unit prices for material shown in the Schedule.  There shall be no adjustment for (i) supplies or services for which the  production cost is not affected by such changes, (ii) changes in rates  or unit prices other than those shown in the Schedule, or (iii) changes  in the quantities of labor or material used from those shown in the  Schedule for each item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No upward adjustment shall apply to supplies or services that  are required to be delivered or performed before the effective date of  the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver or perform  according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the  Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the  meaning of the Default clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for  labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which  would not result in a net change of at least 3 percent of the then- current total contract price. This limitation shall not apply, however,  if, after final delivery of all contract line items, either party  requests an adjustment under paragraph (b) above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made  under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit  price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases that  may be made under this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contracting Officer may examine the Contractor's books,  records, and other supporting data relevant to the cost of labor  (including fringe benefits) and material during all reasonable times  until the end of 3 years after the date of final payment under this  contract or the time periods specified in subpart 4.7 of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 62 FR 238, Jan. 2, 1997]</p>
