                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any  engine failing pursuant to Sec. 90.510(b) effective from the time that  testing of that engine is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for  a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant to paragraph  Sec. 90.510(c), based on the first test or all tests conducted on each  engine. This suspension will not occur before ten days after failure of  the audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate  that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a  manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the  certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the  certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines  manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the  application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the  Administrator may suspend such certificate in whole or in part if the  Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be  substantial:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test  order issued by the Administrator under Sec. 90.503.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any  report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted  under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is  denied the opportunity to conduct activities related to entry and access  as authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented  to the manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is  unable to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized  in Sec. 90.506 because a manufacturer has located a facility in a  foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of  any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or  in part, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with  respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a  family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b)  or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as  reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a  design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as  described in the application for certification of the affected family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as  provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer shall  take the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remedy the nonconformity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards by  retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful  completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description  of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other  information that may be required by this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended  pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall  take the following actions before the Administrator will consider  reinstating the certificate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies  the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed  remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or  quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent  future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the  remedies will be implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of  conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations  by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine  family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage  facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the  conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer  elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a  certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually  determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards through  testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that  the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Once the certificate has been revoked for a family and the  manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a  modified version of that family, the following actions shall be taken  before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that  modified family:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in  engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration,  the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working  days after receipt of the report in paragraph (f) of this section,  whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to  evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing  will be required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the  nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the modified  engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing  engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine  family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test  order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the  Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate,  as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the  manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1)  of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation  remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are  limited to the family affected by the test order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate  of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  section, but not later than 15 days or such other period as may be  allowed by the Administrator after notification of the Administrator's  decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in  part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a  manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been  properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph  (d) of this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered  an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Secs. 90.512,  90.513, and 90.514 and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of  conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a  hearing under Sec. 90.512, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the  Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or  void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the  Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when  conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a failure of an SEA and  while reauditing the failed family it may request that the Administrator  conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The  Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition  that the manufacturer commits to recall all engines of that family  produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if  the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and  to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</p>
