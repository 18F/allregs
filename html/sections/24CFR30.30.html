The Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, or his or her designee, or the Director of the Office of Technical Assistance and Management may initiate a civil money penalty action against persons who knowingly and materially violate section 810 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1706e), or the provisions of 24 CFR part 590, in the use or conveyance of property made available under the Urban Homestead Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum penalty. The maximum penalty is either twice the amount of the gross profit realized from any impermissible use or conveyance of the property, or the amount of section 810 funds used to reimburse HUD, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Resolution Trust Corporation, or the Farmers Home Administration (or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) for the property, whichever is greater. If the property is still held by the violator, the gross profit shall include any appreciation between the amount the violator paid for the property and its current value as determined by an independent, HUD-qualified appraiser.</p>
