The Physical Inspection Report allows the  PHA to see the points lost by inspectable area, and the impact on the  score of the H&S; and EHS deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If EHS items are identified in the report, the PHA shall have  the opportunity to correct, remedy, or act to abate all EHS deficiencies  and may request a reinspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request for reinspection must be made within 45 days of the  PHA's receipt of the Physical Inspection Report. The request for  reinspection must be accompanied by the PHA's identification of the EHS  deficiencies that have been corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate  and by the PHA's certification that all such deficiencies identified in  the report have been corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If HUD determines that a reinspection is appropriate, it will  arrange for a complete reinspection of the project(s) in question, not  just the deficiencies previously identified. The reinspection will  constitute the final physical inspection for the project, and HUD will  issue a new inspection report (the final inspection report).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If any of the previously identified EHS deficiencies that the  PHA certified were corrected, remedied, or   acted upon to abate are found during the reinspection not to have been  corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate, the score in the final  inspection report will reflect a point deduction of triple the value of  the original deduction, up to the maximum possible points for the unit  or area, and the PHA must reimburse HUD for the cost of the  reinspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a request for reinspection is not made within 45 days after  the date that the PHA receives the Physical Inspection Report, the  Physical Inspection Report issued to the PHA will be the final Physical  Inspection Report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Physical Inspection Report includes the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Normalized weights as the ``possible points'' by area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The area scores, taking into account the points deducted for  observed deficiencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The H&S; (nonlife threatening) and EHS (life threatening)  deductions for each of the five inspectable areas; a listing of all  observed smoke detector deficiencies; and a projection of the total  number of H&S; and EHS problems that the inspector potentially would see  in an inspection of all buildings and all units; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The overall project score.</p>
