                                Sec. 575.301  Vehicle labeling of safety rating information
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and Scope. The purpose of this section is to aid  potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger motor vehicles by  providing them with safety rating information developed by NHTSA in its  New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing. Manufacturers of passenger  motor vehicles described in paragraph (b) of this   section are required to include this information on the Monroney label.  Although NHTSA also makes the information available through means such  as postings at http://www.safercar.gov and http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov, the  additional Monroney label information is intended to provide consumers  with relevant information at the point of sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. This section applies to automobiles with a GVWR of  10,000 pounds or less, manufactured on or after September 1, 2007, that  are required by the Automobile Information Disclosure Act, 15 U.S.C.  1231-1233, to have price sticker labels (Monroney labels), e.g.  passenger vehicles, station wagons, passenger vans, and sport utility  vehicles, except for vehicles that are subject to Sec. 575.302. Model  Year 2012 or later vehicles manufactured prior to January 31, 2012 may  be labeled according to the provisions of Sec. 575.302 instead of this  section provided the ratings placed on the safety rating label are  derived from vehicle testing conducted by the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration under the enhanced NCAP testing and rating  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monroney label means the label placed on new  automobiles with the manufacturer's suggested retail price and other  consumer information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safety rating label means the label with NCAP safety rating  information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1232(g). The safety rating label  is part of the Monroney label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required Label. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this  section, each vehicle must have a safety rating label that is part of  its Monroney label, meets the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of  this section, and conforms in content, format and sequence to the sample  label depicted in Figure 1 of this section. If NHTSA has not provided a  safety rating for any category of vehicle performance for a vehicle, the  manufacturer may use the smaller label specified in paragraph (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label must depict the star ratings for that vehicle as  reported to the vehicle manufacturer by NHTSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever NHTSA informs a manufacturer in writing of a new safety  rating for a specified vehicle or the continued applicability of an  existing safety rating for a new model year, including any safety  concerns, the manufacturer shall include the new or continued safety  rating on vehicles manufactured on or after the date 30 calendar days  after receipt by the manufacturer of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, for a vehicle that has an existing safety rating for a  category, NHTSA informs the manufacturer in writing that it has approved  an optional NCAP test that will cover that category, the manufacturer  may depict vehicles manufactured on or after the date of receipt of the  information as ``Not Rated'' or ``To Be Rated'' for that category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The text ``Frontal Crash,'' ``Side Crash,'' ``Rollover,''  ``Driver,'' ``Passenger,'' ``Front Seat,'' ``Rear Seat'' and where  applicable, ``Not Rated'' or ``To Be Rated,'' the star graphic  indicating each rating, as well as any text in the header and footer  areas of the label, must have a minimum font size of 12 point. All  remaining text and symbols on the label (including the star graphic  specified in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(A) of this section, must have a minimum  font size of 8 point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required Information and Format--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety Rating Label Border.  The safety rating label must be surrounded by a solid dark line that is  a minimum of 3 points in width.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safety Rating Label Size and Legibility. The safety rating label  must be presented in a legible, visible, and prominent fashion that  covers at least 8 percent of the total area of the Monroney label (i.e.,  including the safety rating label) or an area with a minimum of 4\1/2\  inches in length and 3\1/2\ inches in height on the Monroney label,  whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Heading Area. The words ``Government Safety Ratings'' must be in  boldface, capital letters that are light in color and centered. The  background must be dark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Frontal Crash Area. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The frontal crash area must be placed  immediately below the heading area and must have dark text and a light  background. Both   the driver and the right front passenger frontal crash test ratings must  be displayed with the maximum star ratings achieved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The words ``Frontal Crash'' must be in boldface, cover two  lines, and be aligned to the left side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The word ``Driver'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Frontal'' in ``Frontal Crash,'' and be left justified, horizontally  centered and vertically aligned at the top of the label. The achieved  star rating for ``Driver'' must be on the same line, left justified, and  aligned to the right side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for the ``Driver''  position, the text ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface. However, as  an alternative, the words ``To Be Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if  the manufacturer has received written notification from NHTSA that the  vehicle has been chosen for NCAP testing. Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Driver'', left justified, and aligned to the right  side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The word ``Passenger'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Crash'' in ``Frontal Crash,'' below the word ``Driver,'' and be left  justified, horizontally centered and vertically aligned at the top of  the label. The achieved star rating for ``Passenger'' must be on the  same line, left justified, and aligned to the right side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Passenger,''  the words ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface.

Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Passenger'', left justified, and aligned to the right  side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The words ``Star ratings based on the risk of injury in a  frontal impact.'', followed (on the next line) by the statement  ``Frontal ratings should ONLY be compared to other vehicles of similar  size and weight.'' must be placed at the bottom of the frontal crash  area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Side Crash Area. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The side crash area must be immediately  below the frontal crash area, separated by a dark line that is a minimum  of three points in width. The text must be dark against a light  background.

The achieved star  rating for ``Front seat'' must be on the same line, left justified, and  aligned to the right side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Front Seat,''  the words ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface. However, as an  alternative, the words ``To Be Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if the  manufacturer has received written notification from NHTSA that the  vehicle has been chosen for NCAP testing. Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Front seat'', left justified, and aligned to the  right side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The words ``Rear seat'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Crash'' in ``Side Crash,'' below the word ``Front seat,'' and be left  justified, horizontally centered and vertically aligned in the middle of  the label. The achieved star rating for ``Rear seat'' must be on the  same line, left justified, and aligned to the right side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Rear Seat,''  the text ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface.
