                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A written request for inspection or copying of a record of the Commission may be presented in person, or by mail, or by fax, or by email, or through https://egov.eeoc.gov/foia/ to the Commission employee designated in Sec. 1610.7. Every request, regardless of format, must contain the requester's name and may identify a non-electronic mailing address. In-person requests must be presented during business hours on any business day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request must be clearly and prominently identified as a request for information under the ``Freedom of Information Act.'' If submitted by mail, or otherwise submitted under any cover, the envelope or other cover must be similarly identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A respondent must always provide a copy of the ``Filed'' stamped court complaint when requesting a copy of a charge file. The charging party must provide a copy of the ``Filed'' stamped court complaint when requesting a copy of the charge file if the Notice of Right to Sue has expired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each request must contain information which reasonably describes the records sought and, when known, should contain a name, date, subject matter and location for the record requested in order to permit the record to be promptly located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where a request is not considered reasonably descriptive or requires the production of voluminous records, or necessitates the utilization of a considerable number of work hours to the detriment of the business of the Commission, the Commission may require the person making the request or such

person's agent to confer with a Commission representative in order to attempt to verify the scope of the request and, if possible, narrow such request.
