                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Rescue boats shall be square-sterned, of normal  proportions, not less than 11 feet nor more than 14 feet in length. The  length shall be the overall horizontal distance from bow to stern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction. The method of construction shall be such as is  accepted as good engineering practice in the case of the specific  material used. The hull shall be suitably stiffened to assure adequate  strength.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Weight. The weight of the rescue boat, fully equipped, shall not  exceed 225 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Seats. The rescue boat shall be fitted with three thwarts. The  middle thwart shall be arranged as the rowing seat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Internal buoyancy. Buoyant material of suitable unicellular  plastic foam shall be installed in the rescue boat. This material shall  be protected from mechanical damage. It shall be distributed uniformly  in the boat and such that at least one-quarter of the required volume is  located at the sides of the boat. The minimum amount of   buoyant material, in cubic feet, shall be determined by the following:  B = 2 + (W - W / d) / 62.4 - c (1)  Where:  B = Volume of buoyant material required in cubic feet. W = Weight of equipped boat, in pounds. d = Specific gravity of hull material. c = Density of buoyant material, in pounds per cubic foot.</p>
