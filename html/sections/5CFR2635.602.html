                            <p class="depth0">To ensure that he does not violate 18 U.S.C. 208(a) or the  principles of ethical conduct contained in Sec. 2635.101(b), an employee  who is seeking employment or who has an arrangement concerning  prospective employment shall comply with the applicable disqualification  requirements of Secs. 2635.604 and 2635.606 if particular matters in  which the employee will be participating personally and substantially  would directly and predictably affect the financial interests of a  prospective employer or of a person with whom he has an arrangement  concerning prospective employment. Compliance with this subpart also  will ensure that the employee does not violate subpart D or E of this  part.</p><p class="depth0">Note: An employee who is seeking employment with a person whose  financial interests are not affected directly and predictably by  particular matters in which he participates personally and substantially  has no obligation under this subpart. An employee may, however, be  subject to other statutes which impose requirements on employment  contacts or discussions, such as 41 U.S.C. 423(c), applicable to agency  officials involved in certain procurement matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Related employment restrictions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Outside employment while a  Federal employee. An employee who is contemplating outside employment to  be undertaken concurrently with his Federal employment must abide by any  limitations applicable to his outside activities under subparts G and H  of this part. He must also comply with any disqualification requirement  that may be applicable under subpart D or E of this part as a result of  his outside employment activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Post-employment restrictions. An employee who is contemplating  employment to be undertaken following the termination of his Federal  employment should consult an agency ethics official to obtain advice  regarding any post-employment restrictions that may be applicable.  Regulations implementing the Governmentwide post-employment statute, 18  U.S.C. 207, are contained in parts 2637 and 2641 of this chapter.  Employees are cautioned that they may be subject to additional statutory  prohibitions on post-employment acceptance of compensation from  contractors, such as 41 U.S.C. 423(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interview trips and entertainment. Where a prospective employer  who is a prohibited source as defined in Sec. 2635.203(d) offers to  reimburse an employee's travel expenses, or provide other reasonable  amenities incident to employment discussions, the employee may accept  such amenities in accordance with Sec. 2635.204(e)(3).
