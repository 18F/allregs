                                Sec. 26.103  What enforcement actions apply in FHWA and FTA programs?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply to enforcement actions under  FHWA and FTA programs:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Noncompliance complaints. Any person who believes that a  recipient has failed to comply with its obligations under this part may  file a written complaint with the concerned operating administration's  Office of Civil Rights. If you want to file a complaint, you must do so  no later than 180 days after the date of the alleged violation or the  date on which you learned of a continuing course of conduct in violation  of this part. In response to your written request, the Office of Civil  Rights may extend the time for filing in the interest of justice,  specifying in writing the reason for so doing. The Office of Civil  Rights may protect the confidentiality of your identity as provided in  Sec. 26.109(b). Complaints under this part are limited to allegations  of violation of the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance reviews. The concerned operating administration may  review the recipient's compliance with this part at any time, including  reviews of paperwork and on-site reviews, as appropriate. The Office of  Civil Rights may direct the operating administration to initiate a  compliance review based on complaints received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable cause notice. If it appears, from the investigation  of a complaint or the results of a compliance review, that you, as a  recipient, are in noncompliance with this part, the appropriate DOT  office promptly sends you, return receipt requested, a written notice  advising you that there is reasonable cause to find you in  noncompliance. The notice states the reasons for this finding and  directs you to reply within 30 days concerning whether you wish to begin  conciliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conciliation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you request conciliation, the appropriate  DOT office shall pursue conciliation for at least 30, but not more than  120, days from the date of your request. The appropriate DOT office may  extend the conciliation period for up to 30 days for good cause,  consistent with applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you and the appropriate DOT office sign a conciliation  agreement, then the matter is regarded as closed and you are regarded as  being in compliance. The conciliation agreement sets forth the measures  you have taken or will take to ensure compliance. While a conciliation  agreement is in effect, you remain eligible for FHWA or FTA financial  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The concerned operating administration shall monitor your  implementation of the conciliation agreement and ensure that its terms  are complied with. If you fail to carry out the terms of a conciliation  agreement, you are in noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you do not request conciliation, or a conciliation agreement  is not signed within the time provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, then enforcement proceedings begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Enforcement actions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enforcement actions are taken as  provided in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicable findings in enforcement proceedings are binding on  all DOT offices.</p>
