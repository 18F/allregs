                            <p class="depth0">Section 98.293 provides three different procedures for emission  calculations. The appropriate paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section  should be used for the procedure chosen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you determine your emissions using Sec. 98.293(b)(2)  (Equation CC-1 of this subpart) you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the monthly inorganic carbon content of the trona from  a weekly composite analysis for each soda ash manufacturing line, using  a modified version of ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005)e1, Standard Test  Methods for Analysis of Soda Ash (Sodium Carbonate) (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 98.7). ASTM E359-00(Reapproved 2005) e1 is designed  to measure the total alkalinity in soda ash not in trona. The modified  method referred to above adjusts the regular ASTM method to express the  results in terms of trona. Although ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005) e1  uses manual titration, suitable autotitrators may also be used for this  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure the mass of trona input produced by each soda ash  manufacturing line on a monthly basis using belt scales or methods used  for accounting purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the  monthly measurements of trona consumed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> Equation CC-2 of this subpart), you  must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the inorganic carbon content of the soda ash (i.e.,  soda ash purity) using ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005) e1 Standard Test  Methods for Analysis of Soda Ash (Sodium Carbonate) (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 98.7).
