                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible transferees. The right to acquire surplus property without monetary consideration for airport purposes, under 50 U.S.C. 1622(g), with the approval of the Administrator of GSA, is limited to states, political subdivisions, municipalities and tax-supported institutions. This is the proper statutory provision governing transfers of entire military airports to state or local agencies for their use as public airports. The right of such transferees is subordinate to the priority of Federal agencies to acquire the property for their own use. Airport property will not be disposed of for any other non-Federal use until every reasonable effort has been made to dispose of it for airport purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preliminary procedures. (1) Request a determination by the Administrator of the FAA that the surplus land is essential, suitable or desirable for the development, improvement, operation or maintenance of a public airport as required by 50 U.S.C. 1622(g)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request a determination by the Administrator of the FAA that the surplus land is essential, suitable or desirable for the development, improvement, operation or maintenance of a public airport as required by 50 U.S.C. 1622(g)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of a determination by the Administrator of FAA, furnish

the FAA Regional Office with a description of the property, or a copy of the Standard Form 118 if the property has been reported to GSA for screening, together with a list of the operating and maintenance equipment available for disposal with the airfield, and request that a survey under the Surplus Property Act be made and that, based thereon, recommendations for classification of the property under the Act be furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classification. District Engineers are authorized to approve ENG Form 1825, Real Property Classification, based on FAA recommendations. Generally, the recommendations of FAA in regard to classification of property, will be followed, except the following will be forwarded to DAEN-REM without final classification action: cases involving reduction in land areas, runways, taxiways, etc.; controversial cases; and cases where changes in the reservations, restrictions, or conditions specified in the Act are recommended by FAA. District Engineers will not classify as airport property, property in excess of that recommended by FAA or property of which the highest and best use is determined to be industrial. Where the District Engineer does not agree with the report of FAA, he will immediately submit complete data setting forth all objections to the report, together with his recommendations, to DAEN-REM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of availability. Upon classification of the property as airport property, notice of the proposed disposal will be sent by certified mail to the political subdivisions, or municipalities in which the property is located, and also to any other state, political subdivision, municipality, or tax-supported institution which the District Engineer has reason to believe may be interested in the property. A reasonable time will be allowed eligible agencies to submit an acceptable application. Figure 11-6 in ER 405-1-12 is a format for use in preparing the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Advertising. The proposed disposal of airport property will be advertised in at least two newspapers of general circulation within the state in which the airport is located. This advertising will insure notification to political subdivisions, tax-supported institutions, and others that the property is available. Property not classified as airport property will be advertised in accordance with the applicable requirements for the type of property. However, the first advertising of non-airport property adjacent to an airport will contain a statement that the property may be acquired under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, for airport purposes, provided FAA approves such acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Form of application. Public agencies desiring to acquire surplus airport property will be required to submit an Application For Airport Property (Figure 11-7 in ER 405-1-12). The application includes the provisions of section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended. If the applicant desires to enter and use the property prior to conveyance, such other terms and conditions considered desirable and necessary governing interim use of the property by the applicant will be included. The application will be signed by the applicant and forwarded to DAEN-REM for acceptance by proper authority in the Department. Evidence of the applicant's legal and financial ability to maintain and operate the property, as proposed, will also be submitted with the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Request for modifications in the provisions of section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as Amended. Should an applicant request modifications in the restrictions and conditions imposed by section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, the application and all pertinent data, including the FAA report, will be forwarded to DAEN-REM. If the requested modification is approved, the case will again be referred to FAA for its recommendation. If FAA does not concur in the modification, the fact will be reported to DAEN-REM for further necessary action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Personal property. Non-industrial personal property of any other nature or description made available for disposal with an airport and located on it may be transferred with the airport on recommendation by FAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Meetings with public bodies. Close cooperation will be maintained with

FAA, and its representatives will be invited to participate in negotiations with public bodies in connection with transfer of airport property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Land survey. In the event that a property survey is required to establish a correct metes and bounds description of the land to be transferred as airport property, a survey will be provided by the prospective transferee without cost to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Transfer instruments. The type of instrument used in conveying or transferring the Government's interest will vary according to the type of property that may be involved, i.e., wholly Government-owned, mixed owned and leased, and leased property. However, instruments of conveyances will contain provisions required by the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended. Where a lease is involved and it is from other than the prospective transferee, such transferee will be required to obtain a long term lease on the land prior to conveyance of the Government-owned improvements. Execution of the lease to the prospective transferee and acceptance of the application by the Government should be handled simultaneously. Figure 11-8 in ER 405-1-12 is a format of quitclaim deed covering fee-owned and leased land (Airport Property). A quitclaim deed can be used to surrender leased land and convey the improvements and related personal property, or this can be done by supplemental agreement to the lease or other type of contract as considered desirable in accordance with local conveyancing practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Recordation. All transfer instruments will be recorded by and at the expense of the transferee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Compliance. The Administrator, FAA, is responsible for determining and enforcing compliance of conditions and restrictions contained in any instrument of disposal of airport property, and is authorized to reform, correct, or amend any such instrument for such action as deemed necessary by him under applicable law. Care will be exercised to furnish copies of the application, classification, and instrument of conveyance to FAA so that it can properly perform its compliance function.</p>
