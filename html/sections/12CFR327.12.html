                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement to prepay assessment. On December 30, 2009, each  insured depository institution shall pay to the FDIC a prepaid  assessment, which shall equal its estimated quarterly risk-based  assessments aggregated for the fourth quarter of 2009, and all of 2010,  2011, and 2012 (the ``prepayment period'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of prepaid assessment-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepaid assessment-- </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Fourth quarter 2009 and all of 2010. An institution's prepaid assessment  for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 shall be determined  by multiplying its prepaid assessment rate as defined in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section times the corresponding prepaid assessment base  for each quarter as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All of 2011 and 2012. An institution's prepaid assessment for  each quarter of 2011 and 2012 shall be determined by multiplying the sum  of its prepaid assessment rate as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, plus .75 basis points (which implements the 3 basis point  increase in annual assessment rates adopted by the Board on September  29, 2009), times the corresponding prepaid assessment base for each  quarter determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepaid assessment rate. For each quarter of the prepayment  period, an institution's prepaid assessment rate shall equal the total  base assessment rate that the institution would have paid for the third  quarter of 2009 had the institution's CAMELS ratings in effect on  September 30, 2009, and, where applicable, long-term debt issuer ratings  in effect on September 30, 2009, been in effect for the entire third  quarter of 2009.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepaid assessment base. For each quarter of the prepayment  period, an institution's prepaid assessment base shall be calculated by  increasing its third quarter 2009 assessment base at an annual rate of 5  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Finality of prepaid assessment. The prepaid assessment rate and  prepaid assessment base defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this  section shall be determined based upon data in the FDIC's computer  systems as of December 24, 2009. Changes to data underlying an  institution's adjusted total base assessment rate or assessment base,  whether by amendment to a report of condition or otherwise, received by  the FDIC after December 24, 2009, shall not affect an institution's  prepaid assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prepaid assessment rates for mergers and consolidations. For  mergers and consolidations recorded in the FDIC's computer systems no  later than December 24, 2009, the acquired institution's prepaid  assessment rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the  prepaid assessment rate of the acquiring institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Invoicing of prepaid assessment. The FDIC shall advise each  insured depository institution of the amount and calculation of its  prepaid assessment at the same time the FDIC provides the   institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the third  quarter of 2009. The FDIC will re-invoice through FDICconnect based upon  any data changes as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of prepaid assessment. Each insured depository  institution shall pay to the Corporation the amount of its prepaid  assessment as required under paragraph (a) of this section in compliance  with and subject to the provisions of Secs. 327.3 and 327.7 of subpart  A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exception to ACH payment. If an institution's prepaid assessment  is greater than $99 million, the institution shall make payment by wire  transfer to the FDIC, rather than by funding its designated deposit  account for payment via ACH as provided in Sec. 327.3 of subpart A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-time assessment credits. The FDIC will not apply an  institution's one-time assessment credit under subpart B of this part  327 to reduce an institution's prepaid assessment. The FDIC will apply  an institution's remaining one-time assessment credits under Part 327  subpart B to its quarterly deposit insurance assessments before applying  its prepaid assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of prepaid assessments. Prepaid assessments shall only be  used to offset regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance  assessments payable under this subpart A. The FDIC will begin offsetting  regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments against  prepaid assessments on March 30, 2010. The FDIC will continue to make  such offsets until the earlier of the exhaustion of the institution's  prepaid assessment or June 30, 2013. Any prepaid assessment remaining  after collection of the amount due on June 30, 2013, shall be returned  to the institution. If the FDIC, in its discretion, determines that its  liquidity needs allow, it may return any remaining prepaid assessment to  the institution prior to June 30, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfers. An insured depository institution may enter into an  agreement to transfer, but not pledge, any portion of that institution's  prepaid assessment to another insured depository institution, provided  that the parties to the agreement notify the FDIC's Division of Finance  and submit a written agreement, signed by legal representatives of both  institutions. The parties must include documentation stating that each  representative has the legal authority to bind the institution. The  institution transferring its prepaid assessment shall submit the  required notice and documentation through FDICconnect. That information  will be presented by the FDIC through FDICconnect to the institution  acquiring the prepaid assessments for its acceptance. The adjustment to  the amount of the prepaid assessment for each institution involved in  the transfer will be made in the next assessment invoice that is sent at  least 10 days after the FDIC's receipt of acceptance by the institution  acquiring the prepaid assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Prepaid assessments following a merger. In the event that an  insured depository institution merges with, or consolidates into,  another insured depository institution, the surviving or resulting  institution will be entitled to use any unused portion of the acquired  institution's prepaid assessment not otherwise transferred pursuant to  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Disposition in the event of failure or termination of insured  status. In the event of failure of an insured depository institution,  any amount of its prepaid assessment remaining (other than any amounts  needed to satisfy its assessment obligations not yet offset against the  prepaid amount) will be refunded to the institution's receiver. In the  event that an insured depository institution's insured status  terminates, any amount of its prepaid assessment remaining (other than  any amounts needed to satisfy its assessment obligations not yet offset  against the prepaid amount) will be refunded to the institution, subject  to the provisions of Sec. 327.6 of subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Exemptions-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exemption without application. The FDIC, after  consultation with an institution's primary federal regulator, will  exercise its discretion as supervisor and insurer to exempt an  institution from the prepayment requirement under paragraph (a) of this  section if the FDIC determines that the prepayment would adversely  affect the safety and soundness of that   institution. No application is required for this review and the FDIC  will notify any affected institution of its exemption by November 23,  2009.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application for exemption. An institution may also apply to the  FDIC for an exemption from the prepayment requirement under paragraph  (a) of this section if the prepayment would significantly impair the  institution's liquidity, or would otherwise create extraordinary  hardship. Written applications for exemption from the prepayment  obligation must be submitted to the Director of the Division of  Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before December 1, 2009, by  electronic mail (prepaidassessment@fdic.gov) or fax (202-898-6676). The  application must contain a full explanation of the need for the  exemption and provide supporting documentation, including current  financial statements, cash flow projections, and any other relevant  information, including any information the FDIC may request. The FDIC  will exercise its discretion in deciding whether to exempt an  institution that files an application for exemption. An application  shall be deemed denied unless the FDIC notifies an applying institution  by December 15, 2009, either that the institution is exempt from the  prepaid assessment or the FDIC has postponed determination under  paragraph (i)(4) of this section. The FDIC's denial of applications for  exemption will be final and not subject to further agency review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application for withdrawal of exemption. An institution that has  received an exemption under paragraph (i)(1) of this section may request  that the FDIC withdraw the exemption. Written applications for  withdrawal of exemption must be submitted to the Director of the  Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before December 1,  2009, by electronic mail (prepaidassessment@fdic.gov) or fax (202-898- 6676). The application must contain a full explanation of the reasons  the exemption is not needed and provide supporting documentation,  including current financial statements, cash flow projections, and any  other relevant information, including any information the FDIC may  request. The FDIC, after consultation with the institution's primary  Federal regulator, will exercise its discretion in deciding whether to  withdraw the exemption. The FDIC will notify an institution of its  decision to withdraw the exemption by December 15, 2009; that  determination will be final and not subject to further agency review. An  application shall be deemed denied unless the FDIC notifies an applying  institution by December 15, 2009, that the exemption is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Postponement of determination. The FDIC may postpone making a  determination on any application for exemption filed under paragraph  (i)(2) of this section until no later than January 14, 2010. An  institution notified by the FDIC of such postponement will not have to  pay the prepaid assessment calculated under paragraph (b) of this  section on December 30, 2009. If the FDIC denies the application for  exemption, the FDIC will notify the institution of the denial and of the  date by which the institution must pay the prepaid assessment. The due  date for payment of the prepaid assessment after such a denial will be  no less than 15 days after the date of the notice of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Obligation to pay third quarter 2009 assessment. Any institution  exempted from the prepayment requirement or any institution whose  application for exemption has been postponed under this section shall  pay to the Corporation on December 30, 2009, any amount due for the  third quarter of 2009 as shown on the certified statement invoice for  that quarter.
