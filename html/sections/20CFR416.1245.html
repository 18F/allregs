                                Sec. 416.1245  Exceptions to required disposition of real property.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loss of housing for joint owner. Excess real property which  would be a resource under Sec. 416.1201 is not a countable resource for  conditional benefit purposes when: it is jointly owned; and sale of the  property by an individual would cause the other owner undue hardship due  to loss of housing. Undue hardship would result when the property serves  as the principal place of residence for one (or more) of the other  owners, sale of the property would result in loss of that residence, and  no other housing would be readily available for the displaced other  owner (e.g., the other owner does not own another house that is legally  available for occupancy). However, if undue hardship ceases to exist,  its value will be included in countable resources as described in  Sec. 416.1207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable efforts to sell. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess real property is not  included in countable resources for so long as the individual's  reasonable efforts to sell it have been unsuccessful. The basis for  determining whether efforts to sell are reasonable, as well as  unsuccessful, will be a 9-month disposal period described in  Sec. 416.1242. If it is determined that reasonable efforts to sell have  been unsuccessful, further SSI payments will not be conditioned on the  disposition of the property and only the benefits paid during the 9- month disposal period will be subject to recovery. In order to be  eligible for payments after the conditional benefits period, the  individual must continue to make reasonable efforts to sell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A conditional benefits period involving excess real property  begins as described at Sec. 416.1242(a). The conditional benefits period  ends at the earliest of the following times:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sale of the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lack of continued reasonable efforts to sell;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual's written request for cancellation of the  agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Countable resources, even without the conditional exclusion,  fall below the applicable limit (e.g., liquid resources have been  depleted); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The 9-month disposal period has expired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable efforts to sell property consist of taking all  necessary steps to sell it in the geographic area covered by the media  serving the area in which the property is located, unless the individual  has good cause for not taking these steps. More specifically, making a  reasonable effort to sell means that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except for gaps of no more than 1 week, an individual must  attempt to sell the property by listing it with a real estate agent or  by undertaking to sell it himself;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 30 days of receiving notice that we have accepted the  individual's signed written agreement to dispose of the property, and  absent good cause for not doing so, the individual must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> List the property with an agent; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Begin to advertise it in at least one of the appropriate local  media, place a ``For Sale'' sign on the property (if permitted), begin  to conduct ``open houses'' or otherwise show the property to interested  parties on a continuous basis, and attempt any other appropriate methods  of sale; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual accepts any reasonable offer to buy and has the  burden of demonstrating that an offer was rejected because it was not  reasonable. If the individual receives an offer that is   at least two-thirds of the latest estimate of current market value, the  individual must present evidence to establish that the offer was  unreasonable and was rejected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An individual will be found to have ``good cause'' for failing  to make reasonable efforts to sell under paragraph (b)(3) of this  section if he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her  control from taking the steps specified in paragraph (b)(3) (i) through  (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An individual who has received conditional benefits through the  expiration of the 9 month disposal period and whose benefits have been  suspended as described at Sec. 416.1320 for reasons unrelated to the  property excluded under the conditional benefits agreement, but whose  eligibility has not been terminated as defined at Secs. 416.1331 through  416.1335, can continue to have the excess real property not included in  countable resources upon reinstatement of SSI payments if reasonable  efforts to sell the property resume within 1 week of reinstatement. Such  an individual will not have to go through a subsequent conditional  benefits period. However, the individual whose eligibility has been  terminated as defined at Secs. 416.1331 through 416.1335 and who  subsequently reapplies would be subject to a new conditional benefits  period if there is still excess real property.
