                                Sec. 1.1502-23  Consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Net section 1231 gains and losses of members arising  during consolidated return years are not determined separately. Instead,  the consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss is determined under this  section for the group as a whole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, T sustains a $20 net capital loss. At the  beginning of Year 2, T becomes a member of the P group. T's capital loss  carryover from Year 1 is subject to SRLY limits under Sec. 1.1502-22(c).  The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated  taxable income for Year 2 (computed without regard to T's net capital  loss carryover under Sec. 1.1502-22):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">P        T ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Year 1 (SRLY) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ordinary..............................................  .......  ....... Capital...............................................  .......     (20)</p><p class="depth3">Year 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ordinary..............................................       10       20 Capital...............................................       70        0 Sec. 1231............................................     (60)       30 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 1231, if the section 1231 losses for any taxable  year exceed the section 1231 gains for such taxable year, such gains and  losses are treated as ordinary   gains or losses. Because the P group's section 1231 losses, $(60),  exceed the section 1231 gains, $30, the P group's net loss is treated as  an ordinary loss. T's net section 1231 gain has the same character as  the P group's consolidated net section 1231 loss, so T's $30 of section  1231 income is treated as ordinary income for purposes of applying  Sec. 1.1502-22(c). Under Sec. 1.1502-22(c), the group's consolidated net  capital gain determined by reference only to T's items is $0. None of  T's capital loss carryover from Year 1 may be taken into account in Year  2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recapture of ordinary loss. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to gains  and losses arising in the determination of consolidated net section 1231  gain or loss for taxable years for which the due date (without  extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to prior periods. See Sec. 1.1502-21(h)(3) for rules  applicable to groups that applied the rules of this section to  consolidated return years ending on or after January 29, 1991, and  beginning before January 1, 1997.  [T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36115, July 2, 1999; 64 FR 41784, Aug. 2, 1999]</p>
