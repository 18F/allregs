Any exceptions that are not disposed of under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are included in a disallowance letter that constitutes the Department's final decision unless the State requests reconsideration by the Administrator or the Departmental Appeals Board. (Specific rules are set forth in Sec.  430.42.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustment.
