                                Sec.  304-3.11  Am I limited to the maximum subsistence allowances  for travel expenses paid by a non-Federal source?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Generally yes. Subsistence expenses are usually limited to the  maximum subsistence allowances (per diem or actual expenses) prescribed  in chapter 301 of this title for travel in CONUS, by the Secretary of  Defense for travel in non-foreign areas and by the Secretary of State  for travel in foreign areas. However, acceptance of payment for, and  when applicable, reimbursement by an agency to an employee and the  accompanying spouse of such employee are not subject to the maximum per  diem or actual subsistence expense rates when traveling in CONUS or in  non-foreign areas under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The non-Federal source pays the full amount of the subsistence  expense, as authorized by your agency; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The subsistence expense paid by the non-Federal source is  comparable in value to that offered to or purchased by other meeting  attendees; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your agency has approved acceptance of payment from the non- Federal source prior to your travel; if your agency has not approved any  acceptance from the non-Federal source, you may not exceed the maximum  allowances. See Sec.  304-3.13.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The maximum subsistence allowances established by the  Secretary of State for travel to foreign areas may not be exceeded.
