                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart A:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Academic term means a semester, trimester, or other such period (not less than six (6) weeks in duration) into which a community college normally subdivides its academic year, but does not include a summer term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Academic year means a twelve month period established by a community college and approved by the Director of Education as the annual period for the operation of the college's education programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Act means the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-471, 92 Stat. 1325, 25 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior, or his/her duly authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Community College means an institution of higher education which (1) is formally controlled or operated and managed by the governing body of an Indian Tribe or by the governing bodies of two or more Indian Tribes, or (2) is established or is otherwise sanctioned or chartered by resolution, ordinance, or other official action (which is still in full force and effect) of such governing body or bodies. However, for purposes of this definition, only one such institution shall be recognized with respect to any one Tribe. A Community College that meets the requirements of this definition with respect to more than one Tribe must meet such requirements with respect to at least one Tribe that has no other currently formally controlled, operated and managed, established, sanctioned, or chartered Community College.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Director of Education means the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or his/her duly authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Full time equivalent or FTE, means the number of Indian students (1) enrolled full-time for an entire academic term at a community college, calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of an academic term, plus (2) the full-time equivalent of the number of other Indian students who are enrolled part-time for an entire academic term at a community college (determined on the basis of the quotient of the sum of credit hours for which all such part-time students are registered during such academic term, divided by twelve (12)), calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of an academic term. The formula for calculating the Indian FTE for an academic term is expressed mathematically as FTE = FT + PTCR / 12 where FT is the number of full time Indian students (those carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of the sixth week of the academic term) and PTCR is the number of credit hours for which part-time Indian students are registered at the end of the sixth week of an academic term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe and is eligible to receive services from the Secretary of the Interior because of his/her status as an Indian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Indian Tribe means an Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, rancheria, or other organized group or community, including any Alaskan Native Village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Institution of higher education as defined in Pub. L. 95-471 (incorporating in part 1201 of the Higher Education Act of 1965), means an educational institution in any State which</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree or provides not less than a two-year program which is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is a public or other nonprofit institution, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association or, if not so accredited,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Is an institution with respect to which the Commissioner of Education has determined that there is satisfactory assurance, considering the resources available to the institution, the period of time, if any, during which it has operated, the effort it is making to meet accreditation standards and the purpose for which this determination is being made, that the institution will meet the accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a reasonable time, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Is an institution whose credits are accepted, on transfer, by not less than three institutions which are so accredited, for credit on the same basis as if transferred from an institution so accredited.
Such term also includes any school which provides not less than a one-year

program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation and which meets the provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3), and (4). Such term also includes a public or nonprofit private educational institution in any State which, in lieu of the requirement in clause (1), admits as regular students persons who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the State in which the institution is located and who have the ability to benefit from the training offered by the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> National Indian Organization means any organization of Indians, found by the Director of Education to be nationally based, representing a substantial Indian constituency, and expert in the field of Indian education.
