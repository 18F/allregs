                                Sec. 536.143  Settlement authority of Foreign Claims Commissions.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to determine whether the claim will be considered by a  one-member or three-member FCC, the claimed amount will be converted to  the U.S. dollar equivalent (based on the annual Foreign Currency  Fluctuation Account exchange rate, where applicable). However, the FCC's  jurisdiction to approve is determined by the conversion rate on the date  of final action. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar has  decreased, the FCC will forward the recommendation to a higher  authority, if necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment will be made in the currency of the country in which the  incident occurred or in which the claimant resided at the time of the  incident, unless the claimant requests payment in U.S. dollars or  another currency and such request is approved by the chief of a command  claims service or the Commander USARCS. However, if the claimant resides  in another foreign country at the time of payment, payment in an amount  equivalent to that which would have been paid under the preceding  sentence may be made in the currency of that third country without the  approval of the Commander USARCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A one-member FCC may consider and pay claims presented in any  amount provided a mutually agreed settlement may be reached in an amount  not exceeding the FCC's monetary authority. A one-member FCC may deny  any claim when the claimed amount does not exceed its monetary  authority. Unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority, a  one-member FCC who is a JA or claims attorney has $15,000 monetary  authority, while any other one-member commission has $5,000 monetary  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A three-member FCC, unless otherwise restricted by the  appointing authority, may take the following actions on a claim that is  properly before it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disapprove a claim presented in any amount. After following the  procedures in Sec. 536.140, including reconsideration, the disapproval  is final and conclusive under 10 U.S.C. 2735. The FCC will inform the  appointing authority of its action. After it takes final action and  disapproves a claim presented in any amount over $50,000, the FCC will  forward to the appointing authority the written notice to the claimant  required by Sec. 536.140(f), any response from the claimant, and its  notice of final action on the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approve and pay meritorious claims presented in any amount. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Claims paid in full or in part for an amount not exceeding $50,000 will  be paid after any reconsideration as set forth in Sec. 536.140. This  action is final and conclusive under 10 U.S.C. 2735.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Claims valued at an amount exceeding $50,000, or multiple  claims arising from the same incident valued at more than $100,000, will  be forwarded through the appointing authority with a memorandum of  opinion to the Commander USARCS for action; see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph  2-60. The memorandum of opinion will discuss the amount for which the  claimant will settle and include the recommendation of the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), The Assistant Judge Advocate  General (TAJAG) and the Commander USARCS, or his or her designee serving  at USARCS, may approve and pay, in whole or in part, any claim as long  as the amount of the award does not exceed $100,000; may disapprove any  claim, regardless of either the amount   claimed or the recommendation of the FCC forwarding the claim; or, if a  claim is forwarded to USARCS for approval of payment in excess of  $50,000, refer the claim back to the FCC or another FCC for further  action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payments in excess of $100,000 will be approved by the Secretary  of the Army, the Army General Counsel as the Secretary's designee, or  other designee of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Following approval where required and receipt of an agreement by  the claimant accepting the specific sum awarded by the FCC, the claim  will be processed for payment in the appropriate currency. The first  $100,000 of any award will be paid from Army claims funds. The excess  will be reported to the Financial Management Service, Department of the  Treasury, with the documents listed in DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-81.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the settlement authority upholds a final offer or authorizes  an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice of the  settlement authority's action will inform the claimant that he or she  must accept the award within 180 days of the date of mailing of the  notice of the settlement authority's action or the award will be  withdrawn, the claim will be deemed denied, and the file will be closed  without future recourse.</p>
