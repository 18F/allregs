                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners or operators of sources subject to this subpart producing styrene butadiene rubber using an emulsion process shall operate the process such that the carbon disulfide concentration in each crumb dryer exhausts shall not exceed 45 ppmv.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall develop standard operating procedures for the addition of sulfur containing shortstop agents to ensure that the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained. There shall be a standard operating procedure representing the production of every grade of styrene butadiene rubber produced at the affected source using a sulfur containing shortstop agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A validation of each standard operating procedure shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to demonstrate compliance with the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall operate the process in accordance with a validated standard operating procedure at all times when styrene butadiene rubber is being produced using a sulfur containing shortstop agent. If a standard operating procedure is changed, it shall be re-validated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records specified in paragraph (d) of this section shall be maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reports shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crumb dryers that are vented to a combustion device are not subject to the provisions in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator shall validate each standard operating procedure to determine compliance with the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section using the testing procedures in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or engineering assessment, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator may choose to conduct a performance test, using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the carbon disulfide concentration limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. One test shall be conducted for each standard operating procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as required, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To determine compliance with the carbon disulfide concentration limit in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall use Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure carbon disulfide. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The following procedures shall be used to calculate carbon disulfide concentration:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour, in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15 minute intervals during the run.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The concentration of carbon disulfide shall be calculated using Equation 32.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05SE96.030
