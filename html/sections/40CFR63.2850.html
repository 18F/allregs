                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to all affected sources:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submit the necessary notifications in accordance with Sec. 63.2860, which include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial notifications for existing sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial notifications for new and reconstructed sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Initial notifications for significant modifications to existing or new sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notification of compliance status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Develop and implement a plan for demonstrating compliance in accordance with Sec. 63.2851.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Develop a written startup, shutdown and malfunction (SSM) plan in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 63.2852.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Maintain all the necessary records you have used to demonstrate compliance with this subpart in accordance with Sec. 63.2862.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Submit the reports in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual compliance certifications in accordance with Sec. 63.2861(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Periodic SSM reports in accordance with Sec. 63.2861(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Immediate SSM reports in accordance with Sec. 63.2861(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Submit all notifications and reports and maintain all records required by the General Provisions for performance testing if you add a control device that destroys solvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Existing sources under normal operation. You must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation, and the schedules for demonstrating compliance for existing sources under normal operation in table 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> New sources. Your new source, including a source that is categorized as new due to reconstruction, must meet the requirements associated with one of two compliance options. Within 15 days of the startup date, you must choose to comply with one of the options listed in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal operation. Upon startup of your new source, you must meet all of the requirements listed in Sec. 63.2850(a) and table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation, and the schedules for demonstrating compliance for new sources under normal operation in table 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial startup period. For up to 6 calendar months after the startup date of your new source, you must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and table 1 of this section for sources operating under an initial startup period, and the schedules for demonstrating compliance for new sources operating under an initial startup period in Table 2 of this section. After a maximum of 6 calendar months, your new source must then meet all of the requirements listed in table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Existing or new sources that have been significantly modified. Your existing or new source that has been significantly modified must meet the requirements associated with one of two compliance options. Within 15 days of the modified source startup date, you must choose to comply with one of the options listed in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal operation. Upon startup of your significantly modified existing or new source, you must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation, and the schedules for demonstrating compliance for an existing or new source that has been significantly modified in table 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial startup period. For up to 3 calendar months after the startup date of your significantly modified existing or new source, you must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and table 1 of this section for sources operating under an initial startup period, and the schedules for demonstrating compliance for a significantly modified existing or new source operating under an initial startup period in table 2 of this section. After a maximum of 3 calendar months, your new or existing source must meet all of the requirements listed in Table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Existing or new sources experiencing a malfunction. A malfunction is defined in Sec. 63.2. In general, it means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment or process equipment to function in a usual manner. If your existing or new source experiences an unscheduled shutdown as a result of a malfunction, continues to operate during a malfunction (including the period reasonably necessary to correct the malfunction), or starts up after a shutdown resulting from a malfunction, then you must meet the requirements associated with one of two compliance options. Routine or scheduled process startups and shutdowns resulting from, but not limited to, market demands, maintenance activities, and switching types of oilseed processed, are not startups or shutdowns resulting from a malfunction and, therefore, do not qualify for this provision. Within 15 days of the beginning date of the malfunction, you must choose to comply with one of the options listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal operation. Your source must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and one of the options listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Existing source normal operation requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New source normal operation requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Normal operation requirements for sources that have been significantly modified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Malfunction period. Throughout the malfunction period, you must meet all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section and Table 1 of this section for sources operating during a malfunction period. At the end of the malfunction period, your source must then meet all of the requirements listed in table 1 of this section for sources under normal operation. Table 1 of this section follows:</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 of Sec. 63.2850--Requirements for Compliance with HAP Emission Standards----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">For initial startup</p><p class="depth0">For periods of normal   periods subject to Sec.
