                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee may not, with or without compensation, represent another before any Government agency, court or commission in connection with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling, contract, claim or other particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee may not act as agent or attorney for anyone else in prosecuting any claim against the United States (18 U.S.C. 205).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As an exception to the above, if it is not inconsistent with the performance of his or her duties, an employee may act without compensation as an agent or attorney for another employee, or a person under active consideration for Federal employment, who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in connection with those proceedings at the administrative level. For example, an employee may represent another employee who is the subject of disciplinary action, or the complainant in a discrimination proceeding, at all stages within the Department and before the Merit Systems Protection Board or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but not in Federal Court. It would be inconsistent with the performance of official duties for a supervisor to represent subordinate employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The law and these regulations do not prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for his or her parents, spouse, child or any person for whom, or estate for which, he or she is acting as fiduciary provided that the head of the principal operating component or his or her designee approve. Such approval, if granted, must be granted in accordance with the procedures for approval of outside activity. However, the employee may not do so if the particular matter is one in which he or she has participated personally and substantially or which is his or her official responsibility. (18 U.S.C. 205).</p>
