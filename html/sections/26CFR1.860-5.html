The right to receive from the REMIC  payments that represent reasonable compensation for services provided to  the REMIC in the ordinary course of its operation is not an interest in  the REMIC. Payments made by the REMIC in exchange for services may be  expressed as a specified percentage of interest payments due on  qualified mortgages or as a specified percentage of earnings from  permitted investments. For example, a mortgage servicer's right to  receive reasonable compensation for servicing the mortgages owned by the  REMIC is not an interest in the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stripped interests. Stripped bonds or stripped coupons not held  by the REMIC are not interests in the REMIC even if, in a transaction  preceding or contemporaneous with the formation of the REMIC, they and  the REMIC's qualified mortgages were created from the same mortgage  obligation. For example, the right of a mortgage servicer to receive a  servicing fee in excess of reasonable compensation from payments it  receives on mortgages held by a REMIC is not an interest in the REMIC.  Further, if an obligation with a fixed principal amount provides for  interest at a fixed or variable rate and for certain contingent payment  rights (e.g., a shared appreciation provision or a percentage of  mortgagor profits provision), and the owner of the obligation  contributes the fixed payment rights to a REMIC and retains the  contingent payment rights, the retained contingent payment rights are  not an interest in the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reimbursement rights under credit enhancement contracts.

Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section, the taxable income of any holder of a residual interest  for any taxable year is in no event less than the sum of the excess  inclusions attributable to that holder's residual interests for that  taxable year. In computing the amount of a net operating loss (as  defined in section 172(c)) or the amount of any net operating loss  carryover (as defined in section 172(b)(2)), the amount of any excess  inclusion is not included in gross income or taxable income. Thus, for  example, if a residual interest holder has $100 of gross income, $25 of  which is an excess inclusion, and $90 of business deductions, the holder  has taxable income of $25, the amount of the excess inclusion, and a net  operating loss of $15 ($75 of other income - $90 of business  deductions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affiliated groups.

If an organization to which section 593 applies holds a residual  interest that has significant value (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)  of this section), section 860E(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this  section do not apply to that organization with respect to that interest.  Consequently, an organization to which section 593 applies may use its  allowable deductions to offset an excess inclusion attributable to a  residual interest that has significant value, but, except as provided in  section 860E(a)(4)(A), may not use its allowable deductions to offset an  excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest held by any other  member of an affiliated group, if any, of which the organization is a  member. Further, a net operating loss of any other member of an  affiliated group of which the organization is a member may not be used  to offset an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest held  by that organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ordering rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. In computing taxable income for  any year, an organization to which section 593 applies is treated as  having applied its allowable deductions for the year first to offset  that portion of its gross income that is not an excess inclusion   and then to offset that portion of its income that is an excess  inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corp. X, a corporation to which section 593 applies, is a  member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return. For a  particular taxable year, Corp. X has gross income of $1,000, and of this  amount, $150 is an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest  that has significant value. Corp. X has $975 of allowable deductions for  the taxable year. Corp. X must apply its allowable deductions first to  offset the $850 of gross income that is not an excess inclusion, and  then to offset the portion of its gross income that is an excess  inclusion. Thus, Corp. X has $25 of taxable income ($1,000-$975), and  that $25 is an excess inclusion that may not be offset by losses  sustained by other members of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Significant value.

The anticipated weighted average  life of a REMIC is the weighted average of the anticipated weighted  average lives of all classes of interests in the REMIC. This weighted  average is determined under the formula in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of  this section, applied by treating all payments taken into account in  computing the anticipated weighted average lives of regular and residual  interests in the REMIC as principal payments on a single regular  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Regular interests that have a specified principal amount.

The following rules  apply for purposes of the formula test in paragraph (c)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferee is assumed to pay tax at a rate equal to the  highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1). If the transferee has  been subject to the alternative minimum tax under section 55 in the  preceding two years and will compute its taxable income in the current  taxable year using the alternative minimum tax rate, then the tax rate  specified in section 55(b)(1)(B) may be used in lieu of the highest rate  specified in section 11(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The direct or indirect transfer of the residual interest to a  foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (within the meaning of an  applicable income tax treaty) of a domestic transferee is not eligible  for the formula test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Present values are computed using a discount rate equal to the  Federal short-term rate prescribed by section 1274(d) for the month of  the transfer and the compounding period used by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Transfer to partnership. X transfers a noneconomic  residual interest in a REMIC to Partnership P in a transaction that does  not satisfy the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Y and  Z are the partners of P. Even if Y and Z are eligible corporations that  satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the  transfer fails to satisfy the asset test requirements found in paragraph  (c)(5)(ii) of this section because P is a partnership rather than an  eligible corporation within the meaning of (c)(6)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Transfer to a corporation without capacity to carry  additional residual interests. During the first ten months of a year,  Bank transfers five residual interests to Corporation U under  circumstances meeting the requirements of the asset test in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section. Bank is the major creditor of U and consequently  has access to U's financial records and has knowledge of U's financial  circumstances. During the last month of the year, Bank transfers three  additional residual interests to U in a transaction that does not meet  the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. At the time of  this transfer, U's financial records indicate it has retained the  previously transferred residual interests. U's financial circumstances,  including the aggregate tax liabilities it has assumed with respect to   REMIC residual interests, would cause a reasonable person to conclude  that U will be unable to meet its tax liabilities when due. The  transfers in the last month of the year fail to satisfy the  investigation requirement in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section and the  asset test requirement of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section because  Bank has reason to know that U will not be able to pay the tax due on  those interests.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Transfer to a foreign permanent establishment of an  eligible corporation. R transfers a noneconomic residual interest in a  REMIC to the foreign permanent establishment of Corporation T. Solely  because of paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, the transfer does not  satisfy the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In  addition, even if T is an eligible corporation, the transfer does not  satisfy the asset test because the transfer fails the requirements of  paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Effective dates. Paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(9) of this  section are applicable to transfers occurring on or after February 4,  2000, except for paragraphs (c)(4)(iii) and (c)(8)(iii) of this section,  which are applicable for transfers occurring on or after August 19,  2002.

For purposes of section 860E (e) and this  section, a transfer of a residual interest to a disqualified  organization in connection with the formation of a REMIC is disregarded  if the disqualified organization has a binding contract to sell the  interest and the sale occurs within 7 days of the startup day (as  defined in section 860G(a)(9) and Sec. 1.860G-2(k)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anticipated excess inclusions. The anticipated excess inclusions  are the excess inclusions that are expected to accrue in each calendar  quarter (or portion thereof) following the transfer of the residual  interest.

The present value of the anticipated  excess inclusions is determined by discounting the anticipated excess  inclusions from the end of each remaining calendar quarter in which  those excess inclusions are expected to accrue to the date the  disqualified organization acquires the residual interest. The discount  rate to be used for this present value computation is the applicable  Federal rate (as specified in section 1274(d)(1)) that would apply to a  debt instrument that was issued on the date the disqualified  organization acquired the residual interest and whose term ended on the  close of the last quarter in which excess inclusions were expected to  accrue with respect to the residual interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Obligation of REMIC to furnish information. A REMIC is not  obligated to determine if its residual interests have been transferred  to a disqualified organization. However, upon request of a person  designated in section 860E(e)(3), the REMIC must furnish information  sufficient to compute the present value of the anticipated excess  inclusions. The information must be furnished to the requesting party  and to the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days of the request.

For purposes of section 860E(e)(3), the term ``agent''  includes a broker (as defined in section 6045(c) and Sec. 1.6045- 1(a)(1)), nominee, or other middleman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Relief from liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transferee furnishes information  under penalties of perjury. For purposes of section 860E(e)(4), a  transferee is treated as having furnished an affidavit if the transferee  furnishes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A social security number, and states under penalties of perjury  that the social security number is that of the transferee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement under penalties of perjury that it is not a  disqualified organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount required to be paid. The amount required to be paid  under section 860E(e)(7)(B) is equal to the product of the highest rate  specified in section 11(b)(1) for the taxable year in which the transfer  described in section 860E(e)(1) occurs and the amount of excess  inclusions that accrued and were allocable to the residual interest  during the period that the disqualified organization held the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Tax on pass-thru entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax on excess inclusions. Any tax  due under section 860E(e)(6) must be paid by the later of March 24,  1993, or by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of  the taxable year of the pass-thru entity in which the disqualified  person is a record holder. The Commissioner may prescribe rules for the  manner and method of collecting the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Record holder furnishes information under penalties of perjury.  For purposes of section 860E(e)(6)(D), a record holder is treated as  having furnished an affidavit if the record holder furnishes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A social security number and states, under penalties of perjury,  that the social security number is that of the record holder; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement under penalties of perjury that it is not a  disqualified organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deductibility of tax. Any tax imposed on a pass-thru entity  pursuant to section 860E(e)(6)(A) is deductible against the gross amount  of ordinary income of the pass-thru entity. For example, in the case of  a REIT, the tax is deductible in determining real estate investment  trust taxable income under section 857(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of tax. Dividends paid by a RIC or by a REIT are not  preferential dividends within the meaning of section 562(c) solely  because the tax expense incurred by the RIC or REIT under section  860E(e)(6) is allocated solely to the shares held by disqualified  organizations.

[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61304, Dec. 24, 1992]    Sec. 1.860F-2  Transfers to a REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Formation of a REMIC--(1) In general. For Federal income tax  purposes, a REMIC formation is characterized as the contribution of  assets by a sponsor (as defined in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section) to  a REMIC in exchange for REMIC regular and residual interests. If,  instead of exchanging its interest in mortgages and related assets for  regular and residual interests, the sponsor arranges to have the REMIC  issue some or all of the regular and residual interests for cash, after  which the sponsor sells its interests in mortgages and related assets to  the REMIC, the transaction is, nevertheless, viewed for Federal income  tax purposes as the sponsor's exchange of mortgages and related assets  for regular and residual interests, followed by a sale of some or all of  those interests. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the tax  consequences associated with the formation of a REMIC are not affected  by the actual sequence of steps taken by the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tiered arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two or more REMICs formed pursuant to a  single set of organizational documents. Two or more REMICs can be  created pursuant to a single set of organizational documents even if for  state law purposes or for Federal securities law purposes   those documents create only one organization. The organizational  documents must, however, clearly and expressly identify the assets of,  and the interests in, each REMIC, and each REMIC must satisfy all of the  requirements of section 860D and the related regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A REMIC and one or more investment trusts formed pursuant to a  single set of documents. A REMIC (or two or more REMICs) and one or more  investment trusts can be created pursuant to a single set of  organizational documents and the separate existence of the REMIC(s) and  the investment trust(s) will be respected for Federal income tax  purposes even if for state law purposes or for Federal securities law  purposes those documents create only one organization. The  organizational documents for the REMIC(s) and the investment trust(s)  must, however, require both the REMIC(s) and the investment trust(s) to  account for items of income and ownership of assets for Federal tax  purposes in a manner that respects the separate existence of the  multiple entities. See Sec. 1.860G-2(i) concerning issuance of regular  interests coupled with other contractual rights for an illustration of  the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of sponsor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sponsor defined. A sponsor is a person  who directly or indirectly exchanges qualified mortgages and related  assets for regular and residual interests in a REMIC. A person  indirectly exchanges interests in qualified mortgages and related assets  for regular and residual interests in a REMIC if the person transfers,  other than in a nonrecognition transaction, the mortgages and related  assets to another person who acquires a transitory ownership interest in  those assets before exchanging them for interests in the REMIC, after  which the transitory owner then transfers some or all of the interests  in the REMIC to the first person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonrecognition of gain or loss. The sponsor does not recognize  gain or loss on the direct or indirect transfer of any property to a  REMIC in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC.  However, the sponsor, upon a subsequent sale of the REMIC regular or  residual interests, may recognize gain or loss with respect to those  interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basis of contributed assets allocated among interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. The aggregate of the adjusted bases of the regular and residual  interests received by the sponsor in the exchange described in paragraph  (a) of this section is equal to the aggregate of the adjusted bases of  the property transferred by the sponsor in the exchange, increased by  the amount of organizational expenses (as described in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section). That total is allocated among all the  interests received in proportion to their fair market values on the  pricing date (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) if  any, or, if none, the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and  Sec. 1.860G-2(k)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Organizational expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Organizational expense defined. An  organizational expense is an expense that is incurred by the sponsor or  by the REMIC and that is directly related to the creation of the REMIC.  Further, the organizational expense must be incurred during a period  beginning a reasonable time before the startup day and ending before the  date prescribed by law for filing the first REMIC tax return (determined  without regard to any extensions of time to file). The following are  examples of organizational expenses: legal fees for services related to  the formation of the REMIC, such as preparation of a pooling and  servicing agreement and trust indenture; accounting fees related to the  formation of the REMIC; and other administrative costs related to the  formation of the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Syndication expenses. Syndication expenses are not  organizational expenses. Syndication expenses are those expenses  incurred by the sponsor or other person to market the interests in a  REMIC, and, thus, are applied to reduce the amount realized on the sale  of the interests. Examples of syndication expenses are brokerage fees,  registration fees, fees of an underwriter or placement agent, and  printing costs of the prospectus or placement memorandum and other  selling or promotional material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pricing date. The term ``pricing date'' means the date on  which the   terms of the regular and residual interests are fixed and the prices at  which a substantial portion of the regular interests will be sold are  fixed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, deemed to have made an election  under section 1278(b) with respect to any other bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>,  deemed to have made an election under section 171(c) with respect to any  other bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unrecognized gain on residual interests. For purposes of  section 860F(b)(1)(C)(ii), the sponsor must include in gross income the  excess of the issue price of a residual interest over the sponsor's  basis in the interest ratably over the anticipated weighted average life  of the REMIC (as defined in Sec. 1.860E-1(a)(3)(iv)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unrecognized loss on residual interests. For purposes of  section 860F(b)(1)(D)(ii), the sponsor deducts the excess of the  sponsor's basis in a residual interest over the issue price of the  interest ratably over the anticipated weighted average life of the  REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additions to or reductions of the sponsor's basis. The sponsor's  basis in a regular or residual interest is increased by any amount  included in the sponsor's gross income under paragraph (b)(4) of this  section. The sponsor's basis in a regular or residual interest is  decreased by any amount allowed as a deduction and by any amount applied  to reduce interest payments to the sponsor under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Transferred basis property. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of  this section, a transferee of a regular or residual interest is treated  in the same manner as the sponsor to the extent that the basis of the  transferee in the interest is determined in whole or in part by  reference to the basis of the interest in the hands of the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> REMIC's basis in contributed assets. For purposes of section  860F(b)(2), the aggregate of the REMIC's bases in the assets contributed  by the sponsor to the REMIC in a transaction described in paragraph (a)  of this section is equal to the aggregate of the issue prices  (determined under section 860G(a)(10) and Sec. 1.86G-1(d)) of all  regular and residual interests in the REMIC.  [T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61304, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993]    Sec. 1.860F-4  REMIC reporting requirements and other administrative rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,  for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, a REMIC is  treated as a partnership and any holder of a residual interest in the  REMIC is treated as a partner. A REMIC is not subject, however, to the  rules of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code,  relating to the treatment of partnership items, for a taxable year if  there is at no time during the taxable year more than one holder of a  residual interest in the REMIC. The identity of a holder of a residual  interest in a REMIC is not treated as a partnership item with respect to  the REMIC for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> REMIC tax return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. To satisfy the requirement  under section 6031 to make a return of income for each taxable year, a  REMIC must file the return required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.  The due date and any extensions for filing the REMIC's annual return are  determined as if the REMIC were a partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income tax return. The REMIC must make a return, as required by   section 6011(a), for each taxable year on Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate  Mortgage Investment Conduit Income Tax Return. The return must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of principal outstanding on each class of regular  interests as of the close of the taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the daily accruals determined under section  860E(c), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The information specified in Sec. 1.860D-1(d)(2) (i), (iv),  and (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Signing of REMIC return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Although a REMIC is  generally treated as a partnership for purposes of subtitle F, for  purposes of determining who is authorized to sign a REMIC's income tax  return for any taxable year, the REMIC is not treated as a partnership  and the holders of residual interests in the REMIC are not treated as  partners. Rather, the REMIC return must be signed by a person who could  sign the return of the entity absent the REMIC election. Thus, the  return of a REMIC that is a corporation or trust under applicable State  law must be signed by a corporate officer or a trustee, respectively.  The return of a REMIC that consists of a segregated pool of assets must  be signed by a person who could sign the return of the entity that owns  the assets of the REMIC under applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> REMIC whose startup day is before November 10, 1988--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. The income tax return of a REMIC whose startup day is before  November 10, 1988, may be signed by any person who held a residual  interest during the taxable year to which the return relates, or, as  provided in section 6903, by a fiduciary, as defined in section  7701(a)(6), who is acting for the REMIC and who has furnished adequate  notice in the manner prescribed in Sec. 301.6903-1(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Startup day. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  startup day means any day selected by a REMIC that is on or before the  first day on which interests in such REMIC are issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception. A REMIC whose startup day is before November 10,  1988, may elect to have paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply, instead  of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in determining who is authorized to  sign the REMIC return. See section 1006(t)(18)(B) of the Technical and  Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 3426) and Sec. 5h.6(a)(1)  of this chapter for the time and manner for making this election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Designation of tax matters person. A REMIC may designate a tax  matters person in the same manner in which a partnership may designate a  tax matters partner under Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-1T of this chapter. For  purposes of applying that section, all holders of residual interests in  the REMIC are treated as general partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

For purposes of section 860G(a)(1)(B)(ii), a  specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages means  a portion of the interest payable on qualified mortgages, but only if  the portion can be expressed as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A fixed percentage of the interest that is payable at either a  fixed rate or at a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section on some or all of the qualified mortgages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A fixed number of basis points of the interest payable on some  or all of the qualified mortgages; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The interest payable at either a fixed rate or at a variable  rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on some or all of the  qualified mortgages in excess of a fixed number of basis points or in  excess of a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specified portion cannot vary.

The Class A  certificate holders are entitled to all principal payments on the  mortgages and to interest on outstanding principal at a variable rate  based on the current value of One-Month LIBOR, subject to a lifetime cap  equal to the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages. The Class B  certificate holders are entitled to all interest payable on the  mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class A certificates.  The Class B certificates are subordinate to the Class A certificates so  that cash flow shortfalls due   to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgages will be borne first by the  Class B certificate holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class B certificate holders are entitled to all interest  payable on the pooled mortgages in excess of a variable rate described  in paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section. Moreover, the portion of the  interest payable to the Class B certificate holders is not treated as  varying over time solely because payments on the Class B certificates  may be reduced as a result of defaults or delinquencies on the pooled  mortgages. Thus, the Class B certificates provide for interest payments  that consist of a specified portion of the interest payable on the  pooled mortgages under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sponsor transferred a pool of variable rate  mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The  mortgages call for interest payments at a variable rate based on the  current value of the One-Year Constant Maturity Treasury Index  (hereinafter ``CMTI'') plus 200 basis points, subject to a lifetime cap  of 12 percent. Class C certificate holders are entitled to all principal  payments on the mortgages and interest on the outstanding principal at a  variable rate based on the One-Year CMTI plus 100 basis points, subject  to a lifetime cap of 12 percent. The interest rate on the Class C  certificates is reset at the same time the rate is reset on the pooled  mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class D certificate holders are entitled to all interest  payments on the mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class C  certificates. So long as the One-Year CMTI is at 10 percent or lower,  the Class D certificate holders are entitled to 100 basis points of  interest on the pooled mortgages. If, however, the index exceeds 10  percent on a reset date, the Class D certificate holders' entitlement  shrinks, and it disappears if the index is at 11 percent or higher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Class D certificate holders are entitled to all interest  payable on the pooled mortgages in excess of a qualified variable rate  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Thus, the Class D  certificates provide for interest payments that consist of a specified  portion of the interest payable on the qualified mortgages under  paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sponsor transferred a pool of fixed rate mortgages  to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The fixed  interest rate payable on the mortgages varies from mortgage to mortgage,  but all rates are between 8 and 10 percent. The Class E certificate  holders are entitled to receive all principal payments on the mortgages  and interest on outstanding principal at 7 percent. The Class F  certificate holders are entitled to receive all interest on the  mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class E certificates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class F certificates provide for interest payments that  consist of a specified portion of the interest payable on the mortgages  under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Although the portion of the  interest payable to the Class F certificate holders varies from mortgage  to mortgage, the interest payable can be expressed as a fixed percentage  of the interest payable on each particular mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rate based on current interest rate. A qualified floating rate  as defined in Sec. 1.1275-5(b)(1) (but without the application of  paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of that section) set at a current value, as  defined in Sec. 1.1275-5(a)(4), is a variable rate. In addition, a rate  equal to the highest, lowest, or average of two or more qualified  floating rates is a variable rate. For example, a rate based on the  average cost of funds of one or more financial institutions is a  variable rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Weighted average rate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A rate based on a  weighted average of the interest rates on some or all of the qualified  mortgages held by a REMIC is a variable rate. The qualified mortgages  taken into account must, however, bear interest at a fixed rate or at a  rate described in this paragraph (a)(3). Generally, a weighted average  interest rate is a rate that, if applied to the aggregate outstanding  principal balance of a pool of mortgage loans for an accrual period,  produces an amount of interest that equals the sum of the interest  payable on the pooled loans for that accrual period. Thus, for an  accrual period in which a pool of mortgage loans comprises $300,000 of  loans bearing a 7 percent interest rate and $700,000 of loans bearing a  9.5 percent interest rate, the weighted average rate for the pool of  loans is 8.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reduction in underlying rate. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, an interest rate is considered to be  based on a weighted average rate even if, in determining that rate, the  interest rate on some or all of the qualified mortgages is first subject  to a cap or a floor, or is first reduced by a   number of basis points or a fixed percentage. A rate determined by  taking a weighted average of the interest rates on the qualified  mortgage loans net of any servicing spread, credit enhancement fees, or  other expenses of the REMIC is a rate based on a weighted average rate  for the qualified mortgages. Further, the amount of any rate reduction  described above may vary from mortgage to mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additions, subtractions, and multiplications. A rate is a  variable rate if it is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Expressed as the product of a rate described in paragraph  (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section and a fixed multiplier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Expressed as a constant number of basis points more or less than  a rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Expressed as the product, plus or minus a constant number of  basis points, of a rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this  section and a fixed multiplier (which may be either a positive or a  negative number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Caps and floors. A rate is a variable rate if it is a rate that  would be described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section  except that it is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Limited by a cap or ceiling that establishes either a maximum  rate or a maximum number of basis points by which the rate may increase  from one accrual or payment period to another or over the term of the  interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limited by a floor that establishes either a minimum rate or a  maximum number of basis points by which the rate may decrease from one  accrual or payment period to another or over the term of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Funds-available caps--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A rate is a variable rate  if it is a rate that would be described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through  (iv) of this section except that it is subject to a ``funds-available''  cap. A funds-available cap is a limit on the amount of interest to be  paid on an instrument in any accrual or payment period that is based on  the total amount available for the distribution, including both  principal and interest received by an issuing entity on some or all of  its qualified mortgages as well as amounts held in a reserve fund. The  term ``funds-available cap'' does not, however, include any cap or limit  on interest payments used as a device to avoid the standards of  paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Facts and circumstances test. In determining whether a cap or  limit on interest payments is a funds-available cap within the meaning  of this section and not a device used to avoid the standards of  paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section, one must consider all  of the facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that must be  taken into consideration are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the rate of the interest payable to the regular interest  holders is below the rate payable on the REMIC's qualified mortgages on  the start-up day; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether, historically, the rate of interest payable to the  regular interest holders has been consistently below that payable on the  qualified mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples, both of which describe a pass- thru trust that is intended to qualify as a REMIC, illustrate the  provisions of this paragraph (a)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sponsor transferred a pool of mortgages to a  trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The pool of  mortgages has an aggregate principal balance of $100x. Each mortgage in  the pool provides for interest payments based on the eleventh district  cost of funds index (hereinafter COFI) plus a margin. The initial  weighted average rate for the pool is COFI plus 200 basis points. The  trust issued a Class X certificate that has a principal amount of $100x  and that provides for interest payments at a rate equal to One-Year  LIBOR plus 100 basis points, subject to a cap described below. The Class  R certificate, which the sponsor designated as the residual interest,  entitles its holder to all funds left in the trust after the Class X  certificates have been retired. The Class R certificate holder is not  entitled to current distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time the certificates were issued, COFI equalled 4.874  percent and One-Year LIBOR equalled 3.375 percent. Thus, the initial  weighted average pool rate was 6.874 percent and the Class X certificate  rate was 4.375 percent. Based on historical data, the sponsor does not  expect the rate paid on the Class X certificate to exceed the weighted  average rate on the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Initially, under the terms of the trust instrument, the excess  of COFI plus 200 over One-Year LIBOR plus 100 (excess interest) will be  applied to pay expenses of the trust,   to fund any required reserves, and then to reduce the principal balance  on the Class X certificate. Consequently, although the aggregate  principal balance of the mortgages initially matched the principal  balance of the Class X certificate, the principal balance on the Class X  certificate will pay down faster than the principal balance on the  mortgages as long as the weighted average rate on the mortgages is  greater than One-Year LIBOR plus 100. If, however, the rate on the Class  X certificate (One-Year LIBOR plus 100) ever exceeds the weighted  average rate on the mortgages, then the Class X certificate holders will  receive One-Year LIBOR plus 100 subject to a cap based on the current  funds that are available for distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this section. First,  on the date the Class X certificates were issued, a significant spread  existed between the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages and  the rate payable on the Class X certificate. Second, historical data  suggest that the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages will  continue to exceed the rate payable on the Class X certificate. Finally,  because the excess interest will be applied to reduce the outstanding  principal balance of the Class X certificate more rapidly than the  outstanding principal balance on the mortgages is reduced, One-Year  LIBOR plus 100 basis points would have to exceed the weighted average  rate on the mortgages by an increasingly larger amount before the funds  available cap would be triggered. Accordingly, the rate paid on the  Class X certificates is a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as those in Example 1, except  that the pooled mortgages are commercial mortgages that provide for  interest payments based on the gross profits of the mortgagors, and the  rate on the Class X certificates is 400 percent on One-Year LIBOR (a  variable rate under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section), subject to a  cap equal to current funds available to the trustee for distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initially, 400 percent of One-Year LIBOR exceeds the weighted  average rate payable on the mortgages. Furthermore, historical data  suggest that there is a significant possibility that, in the future, 400  percent of One-Year LIBOR will exceed the weighted average rate on the  mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts and circumstances here indicate that the use of 400  percent of One-Year LIBOR with the above-described cap is a device to  pass through to the Class X certificate holder contingent interest based  on mortgagor profits. Consequently, the rate paid on the Class X  certificate here is not a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Combination of rates. A rate is a variable rate if it is based  on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One fixed rate during one or more accrual or payment periods and  a different fixed rate or rates, or a rate or rates described in  paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (v) of this section, during other accrual  or payment periods; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A rate described in paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (v) of this  section during one or more accrual or payment periods and a fixed rate  or rates, or a different rate or rates described in paragraph (a)(3) (i)  through (v) of this section in other periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fixed terms on the startup day. For purposes of section  860G(a)(1), a regular interest in a REMIC has fixed terms on the startup  day if, on the startup day, the REMIC's organizational documents  irrevocably specify--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The principal amount (or other similar amount) of the regular  interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest rate or rates used to compute any interest  payments (or other similar amounts) on the regular interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The latest possible maturity date of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Contingencies prohibited. Except for the contingencies specified  in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the principal amount (or other  similar amount) and the latest possible maturity date of the interest  must not be contingent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules for regular interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Call premium. An  interest in a REMIC does not qualify as a regular interest if the terms  of the interest entitle the holder of that interest to the payment of  any premium that is determined with reference to the length of time that  the regular interest is outstanding and is not described in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Customary prepayment penalties received with respect to  qualified mortgages. An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as  a regular interest solely because the REMIC's organizational documents  provide that the REMIC must allocate among and pay to its regular  interest holders any customary prepayment penalties that the REMIC  receives with respect to its qualified mortgages. Moreover, a REMIC may  allocate prepayment penalties among its classes of interests in any  manner specified in the REMIC's organizational documents. For example, a  REMIC   could allocate all or substantially all of a prepayment penalty that it  receives to holders of an interest-only class of interests because that  class would be most significantly affected by prepayments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> (i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prepayments, income, and expenses. An interest does not fail to  qualify as a regular interest solely because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The timing of (but not the right to or amount of) principal  payments (or other similar amounts) is affected by the extent of  prepayments on some or all of the qualified mortgages held by the REMIC  or the amount of income from permitted investments (as defined in Sec.  1.860G-2(g)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The timing of interest and principal payments is affected by the  payment of expenses incurred by the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Credit losses. An interest does not fail to qualify as a  regular interest solely because the amount or the timing of payments of  principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with respect to a  regular interest is affected by defaults on qualified mortgages and  permitted investments, unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC, or  lower than expected returns on permitted investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subordinated interests. An interest does not fail to qualify  as a regular interest solely because that interest bears all, or a  disproportionate share, of the losses stemming from cash flow shortfalls  due to defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted  investments, unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC, lower than  expected returns on permitted investments, or prepayment interest  shortfalls before other regular interests or the residual interest bear  losses occasioned by those shortfalls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deferral of interest. An interest does not fail to qualify as a  regular interest solely because that interest, by its terms, provides  for deferral of interest payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prepayment interest shortfalls. An interest does not fail to  qualify as a regular interest solely because the amount of interest  payments is affected by prepayments of the underlying mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Remote and incidental contingencies. An interest does not fail  to qualify as a regular interest solely because the amount or timing of  payments of principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with  respect to the interest is subject to a contingency if there is only a  remote likelihood that the contingency will occur. For example, an  interest could qualify as a regular interest even though full payment of  principal and interest on that interest is contingent upon the absence  of significant cash flow shortfalls due to the operation of the Soldiers  and Sailors Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. app. 526 (1988).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Form of regular interest. A regular interest in a REMIC may be  issued in the form of debt, stock, an interest in a partnership or  trust, or any other form permitted by state law. If a regular interest  in a REMIC is not in the form of debt, it must, except as provided in  paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, entitle the holder to a specified  amount that would, were the interest issued in debt form, be identified  as the principal amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interest disproportionate to principal--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An  interest in a REMIC does not qualify as a regular interest if the amount  of interest (or other similar amount) payable to the holder is  disproportionately high relative to the principal amount or other  specified amount described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section  (specified principal amount). Interest payments (or other similar  amounts) are considered disproportionately high if the issue price (as  determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of the interest in the  REMIC exceeds 125 percent of its specified principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. A regular interest in a REMIC that entitles the  holder to interest payments consisting of a specified portion of  interest payments on qualified mortgages qualifies as a regular interest  even if the amount of interest is disproportionately high relative to  the specified principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Residual interest. A residual interest is an interest in a REMIC  that is issued on the startup day and that is designated as a residual  interest by providing the information specified in Sec. 1.860D- 1(d)(2)(ii) at the time and in the manner provided in Sec. 1.860D- 1(d)(2). A residual interest need not entitle the holder to any  distributions from the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Issue price of regular and residual interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The issue price of any REMIC regular or residual interest is determined  under section 1273(b) as if the interest were a debt instrument and, if  issued for property, as if the requirements of section 1273(b)(3) were  met. Thus, if a class of interests is publicly offered, then the issue  price of an interest in that class is the initial offering price to the  public at which a substantial amount of the class is sold. If the  interest is in a class that is not publicly offered, the issue price is  the price paid by the first buyer of that interest regardless of the  price paid for the remainder of the class. If the interest is in a class  that is retained by the sponsor, the issue price is its fair market  value on the pricing date (as defined in Sec. 1.860F-2(b)(3)(iii)), if  any, or, if none, the startup day, regardless of whether the property  exchanged therefor is publicly traded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The public. The term ``the public'' for purposes of this section  does not include brokers or other middlemen, nor does it include the  sponsor who acquires all of the regular and residual interests from the  REMIC on the startup day in a transaction described in Sec. 1.860F- 2(a).  [T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61306, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993; 58 FR  15089, Mar. 19, 1993; T.D. 8614, 60 FR 42787, Aug. 17, 1995]    Sec. 1.860G-2  Other rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The 80-percent test. An obligation is principally secured by an  interest in real property if the fair market value of the interest in  real property securing the obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Was at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of  the obligation at the time the obligation was originated (see paragraph  (b)(1) of this section concerning the origination date for obligations  that have been significantly modified); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of  the obligation at the time the sponsor contributes the obligation to the  REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative test. For purposes of section 860G(a)(3)(A), an  obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property if  substantially all of the proceeds of the obligation were used to acquire  or to improve or protect an interest in real property that, at the  origination date, is the only security for the obligation. For purposes  of this test, loan guarantees made by the United States or any state (or  any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the United  States or of any state), or other third party credit enhancement are not  viewed as additional security for a loan. An obligation is not  considered to be secured by property other than real property solely  because the obligor is personally liable on the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of liens. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this  section, the fair market value of the real property interest must be  first reduced by the amount of any lien on the real property interest  that is senior to the obligation being tested, and must be further  reduced by a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the  obligation being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable belief that an obligation is  principally secured.   If, at the time the sponsor contributes an obligation to a REMIC, the  sponsor reasonably believes that the obligation is principally secured  by an interest in real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, then the obligation is deemed to be so secured for  purposes of section 860G(a)(3). A sponsor cannot avail itself of this  safe harbor with respect to an obligation if the sponsor actually knows  or has reason to know that the obligation fails both of the tests set  out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis for reasonable belief. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(3)(i) of this section, a sponsor may base a reasonable belief  concerning any obligation on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Representations and warranties made by the originator of the  obligation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Evidence indicating that the originator of the obligation  typically made mortgage loans in accordance with an established set of  parameters, and that any mortgage loan originated in accordance with  those parameters would satisfy at least one of the tests set out in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Later discovery that an obligation is not principally secured.  If, despite the sponsor's reasonable belief concerning an obligation at  the time it contributed the obligation to the REMIC, the REMIC later  discovers that the obligation is not principally secured by an interest  in real property, the obligation is a defective obligation and loses its  status as a qualified mortgage 90 days after the date of discovery. See  paragraph (f) of this section, relating to defective obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interests in real property; real property. The definition of  ``interests in real property'' set out in Sec. 1.856-3(c), and the  definition of ``real property'' set out in Sec. 1.856-3(d), apply to  define those terms for purposes of section 860G(a)(3) and paragraph (a)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Obligations secured by an interest in real property. Obligations  secured by interests in real property include the following: mortgages,  deeds of trust, and installment land contracts; mortgage pass-thru  certificates guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, or CMHC (Canada Mortgage  and Housing Corporation); other investment trust interests that  represent undivided beneficial ownership in a pool of obligations  principally secured by interests in real property and related assets  that would be considered to be permitted investments if the investment  trust were a REMIC, and provided the investment trust is classified as a  trust under Sec. 301.7701-4(c) of this chapter; and obligations secured  by manufactured housing treated as single family residences under  section 25(e)(10) (without regard to the treatment of the obligations or  the properties under state law).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Obligations secured by other obligations; residual interests.  Obligations (other than regular interests in a REMIC) that are secured  by other obligations are not principally secured by interests in real  property even if the underlying obligations are secured by interests in  real property. Thus, for example, a collateralized mortgage obligation  issued by an issuer that is not a REMIC is not an obligation principally  secured by an interest in real property. A residual interest (as defined  in section 860G(a)(2)) is not an obligation principally secured by an  interest in real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Certain instruments that call for contingent payments are  obligations. For purposes of section 860G(a)(3) and (4), the term  ``obligation'' includes any instrument that provides for total  noncontingent principal payments that at least equal the instrument's  issue price even if that instrument also provides for contingent  payments. Thus, for example, an instrument that was issued for $100x and  that provides for noncontingent principal payments of $100x, interest  payments at a fixed rate, and contingent payments based on a percentage  of the mortgagor's gross receipts, is an obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Release of a lien on an interest in real property securing a  qualified mortgage; defeasance. If a REMIC releases its lien on an  interest in real property that secures a qualified mortgage, that  mortgage ceases to be a qualified mortgage on the date the lien is  released unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The REMIC releases its lien in a modification that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Either is not a significant modification as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)   of this section or is one of the listed exceptions set forth in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Following that modification, the obligation continues to be  principally secured by an interest in real property as determined by  paragraph (b)(7) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mortgage is defeased in the following manner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The mortgagor pledges substitute collateral that consists solely  of government securities (as defined in section 2(a)(16) of the  Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The mortgage documents allow such a substitution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The lien is released to facilitate the disposition of the  property or any other customary commercial transaction, and not as part  of an arrangement to collateralize a REMIC offering with obligations  that are not real estate mortgages; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The release is not within 2 years of the startup day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Stripped bonds and coupons. The term ``qualified mortgage''  includes stripped bonds and stripped coupons (as defined in section  1286(e) (2) and (3)) if the bonds (as defined in section 1286(e)(1))  from which such stripped bonds or stripped coupons arose would have been  qualified mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assumptions and modifications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Significant modifications are  treated as exchanges of obligations. If an obligation is significantly  modified in a manner or under circumstances other than those described  in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then the modified obligation is  treated as one that was newly issued in exchange for the unmodified  obligation that it replaced. Consequently--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If such a significant modification occurs after the obligation  has been contributed to the REMIC and the modified obligation is not a  qualified replacement mortgage, the modified obligation will not be a  qualified mortgage and the deemed disposition of the unmodified  obligation will be a prohibited transaction under section 860F(a)(2);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If such a significant modification occurs before the obligation  is contributed to the REMIC, the modified obligation will be viewed as  having been originated on the date the modification occurs for purposes  of the tests set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Significant modification defined. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, a ``significant modification'' is any change in  the terms of an obligation that would be treated as an exchange of  obligations under section 1001 and the related regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  the following changes in the terms of an obligation are not significant  modifications regardless of whether they would be significant  modifications under paragraph (b)(2) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changes in the terms of the obligation occasioned by default or  a reasonably foreseeable default;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assumption of the obligation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Waiver of a due-on-sale clause or a due-on-encumbrance clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the  terms of a convertible mortgage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A modification that releases, substitutes, adds, or otherwise  alters a substantial amount of the collateral for, a guarantee on, or  other form of credit enhancement for, a recourse or nonrecourse  obligation, so long as the obligation continues to be principally  secured by an interest in real property following the release,  substitution, addition, or other alteration as determined by paragraph  (b)(7) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A change in the nature of the obligation from recourse (or  substantially all recourse) to nonrecourse (or substantially all  nonrecourse), or from nonrecourse (or substantially all nonrecourse) to  recourse (or substantially all recourse), so long as the obligation  continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property  following such a change as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Modifications that are not significant modifications. If an  obligation is modified and the modification is not a significant  modification for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the  modified obligation is not treated as one that was newly originated on  the date of modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assumption defined. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, a mortgage has been assumed if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The buyer of the mortgaged property acquires the property  subject to the mortgage, without assuming any personal liability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The buyer becomes liable for the debt but the seller also  remains liable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The buyer becomes liable for the debt and the seller is  released by the lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Pass-thru certificates. If a REMIC holds as a qualified mortgage  a pass-thru certificate or other investment trust interest of the type  described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the modification of a  mortgage loan that backs the pass-thru certificate or other interest is  not a modification of the pass-thru certificate or other interest unless  the investment trust structure was created to avoid the prohibited  transaction rules of section 860F(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Test for determining whether an obligation continues to be  principally secured following certain types of modifications. (i) For  purposes of paragraphs (a)(8)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, (b)(3)(v), and (b)(3)(vi) of this  section, the obligation continues to be principally secured by an  interest in real property following the modification only if, as of the  date of the modification, the obligation satisfies either paragraph  (b)(7)(ii) or paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, a servicer  must base a reasonable belief on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A current appraisal performed by an independent appraiser;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An appraisal that was obtained in connection with the  origination of the obligation and, if appropriate, that has been updated  for the passage of time and for any other changes that might affect the  value of the interest in real property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The sales price of the interest in real property in the case of  a substantially contemporary sale in which the buyer assumes the  seller's obligations under the mortgage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Some other commercially reasonable valuation method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section is not satisfied, the  fair market value of the interest in real property that secures the  obligation immediately after the modification must equal or exceed the  fair market value of the interest in real property that secured the  obligation immediately before the modification. The criterion in the  preceding sentence must be established by a current appraisal, an  original (and updated) appraisal, or some other commercially reasonable  valuation method; and the servicer must not actually know, or have  reason to know, that the criterion in the preceding sentence is not  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  paragraph (b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S services mortgage loans that are held by R, a REMIC.  Borrower B is the issuer of one of the mortgage loans held by R. The  original amount of B's mortgage loan was $100,000, and the loan was  secured by real property X. At the time the loan was contributed to R,  property X had a fair market value of $90,000. Sometime after the loan  was contributed to R, B experienced financial difficulties such that it  was reasonably foreseeable that B might default on the loan if the loan  was not modified. Accordingly, S altered various terms of B's loan to  substantially reduce the risk of default. The alterations included the  release of the lien on property X and the substitution of real property  Y for property X as collateral for the loan. At the time the loan was  modified, its adjusted issue price was $100,000. The fair market value  of property X immediately before the modification (as determined by a  commercially reasonable valuation method) was $70,000, and the fair  market value of property Y immediately after the modification (as  determined by a commercially reasonable valuation method) was $75,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The alterations to B's loan are a significant modification  within the meaning of Sec. 1.1001-3(e). The modification, however, is  described in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (b)(3) of this section.  Accordingly, the modified loan   continues to be a qualified mortgage if, immediately after the  modification, the modified loan continues to be principally secured by  an interest in real property, as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section because the fair market value of the  interest in real estate (real property Y) that secures the obligation  immediately after the modification ($75,000) exceeds the fair market  value of the interest in real estate (real property X) that secured the  obligation immediately before the modification ($70,000). Accordingly,  the modified loan satisfies paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section and  continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> (2)  and (3) of this section) is not treated as a separate asset of the REMIC  for purposes of the asset test set out in section 860D(a)(4) and Sec.  1.860D-1(b)(3), but instead is treated as part of the mortgage or pool  of mortgages to which it relates. Furthermore, any collateral supporting  a credit enhancement contract is not treated as an asset of the REMIC  solely because it supports the guarantee represented by that contract.  See paragraph (g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section for the treatment of payments  made pursuant to credit enhancement contracts as payments received under  a qualified mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit enhancement contracts. For purposes of this section, a  credit enhancement contract is any arrangement whereby a person agrees  to guarantee full or partial payment of the principal or interest  payable on a qualified mortgage or on a pool of such mortgages, or full  or partial payment on one or more classes of regular interests or on the  class of residual interests, in the event of defaults or delinquencies  on qualified mortgages, unanticipated losses or expenses incurred by the  REMIC, or lower than expected returns on cash flow investments. Types of  credit enhancement contracts may include, but are not limited to, pool  insurance contracts, certificate guarantee insurance contracts, letters  of credit, guarantees, or agreements whereby the REMIC sponsor, a  mortgage servicer, or other third party agrees to make advances  described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> are credit enhancement contracts  regardless of whether, under the terms of the arrangement, the payor is  obligated, or merely permitted, to advance funds to the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advances of delinquent principal and interest. An arrangement by  a REMIC sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party to advance to  the REMIC out of its own funds an amount to make up for delinquent  payments on qualified mortgages is a credit enhancement contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Advances of taxes, insurance payments, and expenses. An  arrangement by a REMIC sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party  to pay taxes and hazard insurance premiums on, or other expenses  incurred to protect the REMIC's security interest in, property securing  a qualified mortgage in the event that the mortgagor fails to pay such  taxes, insurance premiums, or other expenses is a credit enhancement  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Advances to ease REMIC administration. An agreement by a REMIC  sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party to advance temporarily  to a REMIC amounts payable on qualified mortgages before such amounts  are actually due to level out the stream of cash flows to the REMIC or  to provide for orderly administration of the REMIC is a credit  enhancement contract. For example, if two mortgages in a pool have  payment due dates on the twentieth of the month, and all the other  mortgages have payment due dates on the first of each month, an  agreement by the mortgage servicer to advance to the REMIC on the  fifteenth of each month the payments not yet received on the two  mortgages together with the amounts received on   the other mortgages is a credit enhancement contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deferred payment under a guarantee arrangement. A guarantee  arrangement does not fail to qualify as a credit enhancement contract  solely because the guarantor, in the event of a default on a qualified  mortgage, has the option of immediately paying to the REMIC the full  amount of mortgage principal due on acceleration of the defaulted  mortgage, or paying principal and interest to the REMIC according to the  original payment schedule for the defaulted mortgage, or according to  some other deferred payment schedule. Any deferred payments are payments  pursuant to a credit enhancement contract even if the mortgage is  foreclosed upon and the guarantor, pursuant to subrogation rights set  out in the guarantee arrangement, is entitled to receive immediately the  proceeds of foreclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of certain purchase agreements with respect to  convertible mortgages--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of sections  860D(a)(4) and 860G(a)(3), a purchase agreement (as described in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section) with respect to a convertible mortgage  (as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is treated as  incidental to the convertible mortgage to which it relates.  Consequently, the purchase agreement is part of the mortgage or pool of  mortgages and is not a separate asset of the REMIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Purchase agreement. A purchase agreement is a contract between  the holder of a convertible mortgage and a third party under which the  holder agrees to sell and the third party agrees to buy the mortgage for  an amount equal to its current principal balance plus accrued but unpaid  interest if and when the mortgagor elects to convert the terms of the  mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Default by the person obligated to purchase a convertible  mortgage. If the person required to purchase a convertible mortgage  defaults on its obligation to purchase the mortgage upon conversion, the  REMIC may sell the mortgage in a market transaction and the proceeds of  the sale will be treated as amounts paid pursuant to a purchase  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Convertible mortgage. A convertible mortgage is a mortgage that  gives the obligor the right at one or more times during the term of the  mortgage to elect to convert from one interest rate to another. The new  rate of interest must be determined pursuant to the terms of the  instrument and must be intended to approximate a market rate of interest  for newly originated mortgages at the time of the conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Prepayment interest shortfalls. An agreement by a mortgage  servicer or other third party to make payments to the REMIC to make up  prepayment interest shortfalls is not treated as a separate asset of the  REMIC and payments made pursuant to such an agreement are treated as  payments on the qualified mortgages. With respect to any mortgage that  prepays, the prepayment interest shortfall for the accrual period in  which the mortgage prepays is an amount equal to the excess of the  interest that would have accrued on the mortgage during that accrual  period had it not prepaid, over the interest that accrued from the  beginning of that accrual period up to the date of the prepayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Defective obligations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Defective obligation defined. For  purposes of sections 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) and 860F(a)(2), a defective  obligation is a mortgage subject to any of the following defects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The mortgage is in default, or a default with respect to the  mortgage is reasonably foreseeable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mortgage was fraudulently procured by the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The mortgage was not in fact principally secured by an  interest in real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The mortgage does not conform to a customary representation or  warranty given by the sponsor or prior owner of the mortgage regarding  the characteristics of the mortgage, or the characteristics of the pool  of mortgages of which the mortgage is a part. A representation that  payments on a qualified mortgage will be received at a rate no less than  a specified minimum or no greater than a specified maximum is not  customary for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of discovery of defect. If a REMIC discovers that an  obligation is a defective obligation, and if the defect is one that, had  it been discovered before the startup day, would have prevented the  obligation from being a qualified mortgage, then, unless the REMIC  either causes the defect to be cured or disposes of the defective  obligation within 90 days of discovering the defect, the obligation  ceases to be a qualified mortgage at the end of that 90 day period. Even  if the defect is not cured, the defective obligation is, nevertheless, a  qualified mortgage from the startup day through the end of the 90 day  period. Moreover, even if the REMIC holds the defective obligation  beyond the 90 day period, the REMIC may, nevertheless, exchange the  defective obligation for a qualified replacement mortgage so long as the  requirements of section 860G(a)(4)(B) are satisfied. If the defect is  one that does not affect the status of an obligation as a qualified  mortgage, then the obligation is always a qualified mortgage regardless  of whether the defect is or can be cured. For example, if a sponsor  represented that all mortgages transferred to a REMIC had a 10 percent  interest rate, but it was later discovered that one mortgage had a 9  percent interest rate, the 9 percent mortgage is defective, but the  defect does not affect the status of that obligation as a qualified  mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Permitted investments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash flow investment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  For purposes of section 860G(a)(6) and this section, a cash flow  investment is an investment of payments received on qualified mortgages  for a temporary period between receipt of those payments and the  regularly scheduled date for distribution of those payments to REMIC  interest holders. Cash flow investments must be passive investments  earning a return in the nature of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments received on qualified mortgages. For purposes of  paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the term ``payments received on  qualified mortgages'' includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payments of interest and principal on qualified mortgages,  including prepayments of principal and payments under credit enhancement  contracts described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Proceeds from the disposition of qualified mortgages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Cash flows from foreclosure property and proceeds from the  disposition of such property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A payment by a sponsor or prior owner in lieu of the sponsor's  or prior owner's repurchase of a defective obligation, as defined in  paragraph (f) of this section, that was transferred to the REMIC in  breach of a customary warranty; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Prepayment penalties required to be paid under the terms of a  qualified mortgage when the mortgagor prepays the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Temporary period. For purposes of section 860G(a)(6) and this  paragraph (g)(1), a temporary period generally is that period from the  time a REMIC receives payments on qualified mortgages and permitted  investments to the time the REMIC distributes the payments to interest  holders. A temporary period may not exceed 13 months. Thus, an  investment held by a REMIC for more than 13 months is not a cash flow  investment. In determining the length of time that a REMIC has held an  investment that is part of a commingled fund or account, the REMIC may  employ any reasonable method of accounting. For example, if a REMIC  holds mortgage cash flows in a commingled account pending distribution,  the first-in, first-out method of accounting is a reasonable method for  determining whether all or part of the account satisfies the 13 month  limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and (3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualified reserve asset--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``qualified  reserve asset'' means any intangible property (other than a REMIC  residual interest) that is held both for investment and as part of a  qualified reserve fund. An asset need not generate any income to be a  qualified reserve asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reasonably required reserve--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. In determining  whether the amount of a reserve is reasonable, it is appropriate to  consider the credit quality of the qualified mortgages, the extent and  nature of any guarantees relating to either the qualified mortgages or  the regular and residual interests, the expected amount of expenses of  the REMIC, and the expected availability of proceeds from qualified  mortgages to pay the expenses. To the extent that a reserve exceeds a  reasonably required amount, the amount of the reserve must be promptly  and appropriately reduced. If at any time, however, the amount of the  reserve fund is less than is reasonably required, the amount of the  reserve fund may be increased by the addition of payments received on  qualified mortgages or by contributions from holders of residual  interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Presumption that a reserve is reasonably required. The amount of  a reserve fund is presumed to be reasonable (and an excessive reserve is  presumed to have been promptly and appropriately reduced) if it does not  exceed the amount required by a third party insurer or guarantor, who  does not own directly or indirectly (within the meaning of section  267(c)) an interest in the REMIC (as defined in Sec. 1.860D-1(b)(1)),  as a condition of providing credit enhancement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Presumption may be rebutted. The presumption in paragraph  (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section may be rebutted if the amounts required by  the third party insurer are not commercially reasonable considering the  factors described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Applicability date. Paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(C)  of this section apply on and after July 6, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Outside reserve funds. A reserve fund that is maintained to pay  expenses of the REMIC, or to make payments to REMIC interest holders is  an outside reserve fund and not an asset of the REMIC only if the  REMIC's organizational documents clearly and expressly--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide that the reserve fund is an outside reserve fund and not  an asset of the REMIC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the owner(s) of the reserve fund, either by name, or by  description of the class (e.g., subordinated regular interest holders)  whose membership comprises the owners of the fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide that, for all Federal tax purposes, amounts transferred  by the REMIC to the fund are treated as amounts distributed by the REMIC  to the designated owner(s) or transferees of the designated owner(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contractual rights coupled with regular interests in tiered  arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a REMIC issues a regular interest to a  trustee of an investment trust for the benefit of the trust certificate  holders and the trustee also holds for the benefit of those certificate  holders certain other contractual rights, those other rights are not  treated as assets of the REMIC even if the investment trust and the  REMIC were created contemporaneously pursuant to a single set of  organizational documents. The organizational documents must, however,  require that the trustee account for the contractual rights as property  that the trustee holds separate and apart from the regular interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example, which describes a tiered  arrangement involving a pass-thru trust that is intended to qualify as a  REMIC and a pass-thru trust that is intended to be classified as a trust  under Sec. 301.7701-4(c)   of this chapter, illustrates the provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A sponsor transferred a pool of mortgages to a trustee  in exchange for two classes of certificates. The pool of mortgages has  an aggregate principal balance of $100x. Each mortgage in the pool  provides for interest payments based on the eleventh district cost of  funds index (hereinafter COFI) plus a margin. The trust (hereinafter  REMIC trust) issued a Class N bond, which the sponsor designates as a  regular interest, that has a principal amount of $100x and that provides  for interest payments at a rate equal to One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis  points, subject to a cap equal to the weighted average pool rate. The  Class R interest, which the sponsor designated as the residual interest,  entitles its holder to all funds left in the trust after the Class N  bond has been retired. The Class R interest holder is not entitled to  current distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the same day, and under the same set of documents, the  sponsor also created an investment trust. The sponsor contributed to the  investment trust the Class N bond together with an interest rate cap  contract. Under the interest rate cap contract, the issuer of the cap  contract agrees to pay to the trustee for the benefit of the investment  trust certificate holders the excess of One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis  points over the weighted average pool rate (COFI plus a margin) times  the outstanding principal balance of the Class N bond in the event One- Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points ever exceeds the weighted average pool  rate. The trustee (the same institution that serves as REMIC trust  trustee), in exchange for the contributed assets, gave the sponsor  certificates representing undivided beneficial ownership interests in  the Class N bond and the interest rate cap contract. The organizational  documents require the trustee to account for the regular interest and  the cap contract as discrete property rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The separate existence of the REMIC trust and the investment  trust are respected for all Federal income tax purposes. Thus, the  interest rate cap contract is an asset beneficially owned by the several  certificate holders and is not an asset of the REMIC trust.  Consequently, each certificate holder must allocate its purchase price  for the certificate between its undivided interest in the Class N bond  and its undivided interest in the interest rate cap contract in  accordance with the relative fair market values of those two property  rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Clean-up call--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section  860F(a)(5)(B), a clean-up call is the redemption of a class of regular  interests when, by reason of prior payments with respect to those  interests, the administrative costs associated with servicing that class  outweigh the benefits of maintaining the class. Factors to consider in  making this determination include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The number of holders of that class of regular interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency of payments to holders of that class;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The effect the redemption will have on the yield of that class  of regular interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The outstanding principal balance of that class; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The percentage of the original principal balance of that class  still outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest rate changes. The redemption of a class of regular  interests undertaken to profit from a change in interest rates is not a  clean-up call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor. Although the outstanding principal balance is only  one factor to consider, the redemption of a class of regular interests  with an outstanding principal balance of no more than 10 percent of its  original principal balance is always a clean-up call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Startup day. The term ``startup day'' means the day on which the  REMIC issues all of its regular and residual interests. A sponsor may,  however, contribute property to a REMIC in exchange for regular and  residual interests over any period of 10 consecutive days and the REMIC  may designate any one of those 10 days as its startup day. The day so  designated is then the startup day, and all interests are treated as  issued on that day.

A transfer of a residual interest that has tax avoidance  potential is disregarded for all Federal tax purposes if the transferee  is a foreign person. Thus, if a residual interest with tax avoidance  potential is transferred to a foreign holder at formation of the REMIC,  the sponsor is liable for the tax on any excess inclusion that accrues  with respect to that residual interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax avoidance potential--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Defined. A residual interest has  tax avoidance potential for purposes of this section unless, at the time  of the transfer, the transferor reasonably expects that, for each excess  inclusion, the REMIC will distribute to the transferee residual interest  holder an amount that will equal at least 30 percent of the excess  inclusion, and that each such amount will be distributed at or after the  time at which the excess inclusion accrues and not later than the close  of the calendar year following the calendar year of accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this  section, a transferor has a reasonable expectation if the 30-percent  test would be satisfied were the REMIC's qualified mortgages to prepay  at each rate within a range of rates from 50 percent to 200 percent of  the rate assumed under section 1272(a)(6) with respect to the qualified  mortgages (or the rate that would have been assumed had the mortgages  been issued with original issue discount).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effectively connected income. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section  will not apply if the transferee's income from the residual interest is  subject to tax under section 871(b) or section 882.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transfer by a foreign holder. If a foreign person transfers a  residual interest to a United States person or a foreign holder in whose  hands the income from a residual interest would be effectively connected  income, and if the transfer has the effect of allowing the transferor to  avoid tax on accrued excess inclusions, then the transfer is disregarded  and the transferor continues to be treated as the owner of the residual  interest for purposes of section 871(a), 881, 1441, or 1442.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>,  see Sec. Sec. 1.1441-2(b)(5), 1.1441-2(d)(4), 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A), and  Sec. Sec. 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (treating it ``as an excess inclusion with respect to  a residual interest held by'' the taxpayer), the amount shall be taken  into account for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442 at the  same time as the time prescribed for other income of the shareholder,  participant, or patron from the trust, company, fund, or organization.
