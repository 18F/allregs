The death gratuity  shall equal six months' basic pay (plus special, incentive, and  proficiency pay) at the rate to which the deceased member was entitled  on the date of his death but shall not be less than $800 nor more than  $3,000. A kind of special pay included is the 25% increase in pay to  which a member serving on a naval vessel in foreign waters is entitled  under 10 U.S.C. 5540 when retained beyond expiration of enlistment  because such retention was essential to the public interest.</p>
