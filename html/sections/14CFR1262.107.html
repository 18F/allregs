This Agency will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person may file with the Agency a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should be addressed to the General Counsel, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Agency should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used; and should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Agency will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding or denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.</p>
