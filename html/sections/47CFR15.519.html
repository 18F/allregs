                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section must  be hand held, i.e., they are relatively small devices that are primarily  hand held while being operated and do not employ a fixed infrastructure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A UWB device operating under the provisions of this section  shall transmit only when it is sending information to an associated  receiver. The UWB intentional radiator shall cease transmission within  10 seconds unless it receives an acknowledgement from the associated  receiver that its transmission is being received. An acknowledgment of  reception must continue to be received by the UWB intentional radiator  at least every 10 seconds or the UWB device must cease transmitting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of antennas mounted on outdoor structures, e.g.,  antennas mounted on the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or  any fixed outdoors infrastructure is prohibited. Antennas may be mounted  only on the hand held UWB device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section may  operate indoors or outdoors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The UWB bandwidth of a device operating under the provisions of  this section must be contained between 3100 MHz and 10,600 MHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device  operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the  emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz  from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not  exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution  bandwidth of 1 MHz:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 960-1610.............................................              -75.3 1610-1990............................................              -63.3 1990-3100............................................              -61.3 3100-10600...........................................              -41.3 Above 10600..........................................              -61.3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the  table in paragraph (c) of this section, UWB transmitters operating under  the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following average  limits when measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less than 1 kHz:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1164-1240............................................              -85.3 1559-1610............................................              -85.3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There is a limit on the peak level of the emissions contained  within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest  radiated emission occurs, fM. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is  acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a  correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures  described in Sec. 15.521.
