                            <p class="depth0">The ultimate goal for using TIAs, like other assistance instruments  used in defense research programs, is to foster the best technologies  for future defense needs. TIAs differ from and complement other  assistance instruments available to agreements officers, in that TIAs  address the goal by fostering civil-military integration (see appendix A  to this part). TIAs therefore are designed to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reduce barriers to commercial firms' participation in defense  research, to give the Department of Defense (DoD) access to the broadest  possible technology and industrial base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Promote new relationships among performers in both the defense  and commercial sectors of that technology and industrial base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stimulate performers to develop, use, and disseminate improved  practices.</p>
