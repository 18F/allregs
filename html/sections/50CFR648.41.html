                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within season management action. The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) may, at any time, initiate action to implement, add to or adjust Atlantic salmon management measures to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allow for Atlantic salmon aquaculture projects in the EEZ, provided such an action is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Atlantic Salmon FMP; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make changes to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Framework process. After initiation of an action to implement, add to or adjust an Atlantic salmon management measure to allow for an Atlantic salmon aquaculture project in the EEZ, the NEFMC shall develop and analyze Atlantic salmon management measures to allow for Atlantic salmon aquaculture projects in the EEZ over the span of at least two NEFMC meetings. The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and the analysis and opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's recommendation on aquaculture management measures must come from one or more of the following categories: minimum fish sizes, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes, possession limits, tagging requirements, monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, permit restrictions, area closures, establishment of special management areas or zones and any other management measures currently included in the FMP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NEFMC recommendation. After developing Atlantic salmon management measures and receiving public testimony, the NEFMC shall make a recommendation to NMFS. The NEFMC's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts and a recommendation to NMFS on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's recommendation to issue the management measures as a final rule, the NEFMC must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NMFS action. If the NEFMC's recommendation includes implementation of management measures and, after reviewing the NEFMC's recommendation and supporting information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended measures should be issued as a final rule based on the factors specified in

paragraph (c)(1) through (4) of this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, if NMFS concurs with the NEFMC recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NMFS does not concur, the NEFMC will be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
