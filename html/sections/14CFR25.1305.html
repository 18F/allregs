In addition to the  powerplant instruments required by paragraph (a) of this section, the  following powerplant instruments are required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A carburetor air temperature indicator for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A cylinder head temperature indicator for each air-cooled  engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manifold pressure indicator for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A fuel pressure indicator (to indicate the pressure at which the  fuel is supplied) for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A fuel flowmeter, or fuel mixture indicator, for each engine  without an automatic altitude mixture control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A tachometer for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A device that indicates, to the flight crew (during flight), any  change in the power output, for each engine with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An automatic propeller feathering system, whose operation is  initiated by a power output measuring system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A total engine piston displacement of 2,000 cubic inches or  more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A means to indicate to the pilot when the propeller is in  reverse pitch, for each reversing propeller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For turbine engine-powered airplanes. In addition to the  powerplant instruments required by paragraph (a) of this section, the  following powerplant instruments are required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A gas temperature indicator for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A fuel flowmeter indicator for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A tachometer (to indicate the speed of the rotors with  established limiting speeds) for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A means to indicate, to the flight crew, the operation of each  engine starter that can be operated continuously but that is neither  designed for continuous operation nor designed to prevent hazard if it  failed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An indicator to indicate the functioning of the powerplant ice  protection system for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An indicator for the fuel strainer or filter required by Sec.  25.997 to indicate the occurrence of contamination of the strainer or  filter before it reaches the capacity established in accordance with  Sec. 25.997(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A warning means for the oil strainer or filter required by Sec.  25.1019, if it has no bypass, to warn the pilot of the occurrence of  contamination of the strainer or filter screen before it reaches the  capacity established in accordance with Sec. 25.1019(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An indicator to indicate the proper functioning of any heater  used to prevent ice clogging of fuel system components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For turbojet engine powered airplanes. In addition to the  powerplant instruments required by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this  section, the following powerplant instruments are required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An indicator to indicate thrust, or a parameter that is directly  related to thrust, to the pilot. The indication must be based on the  direct measurement of thrust or of parameters that are directly related  to thrust. The indicator must indicate a change in thrust resulting from  any engine malfunction, damage, or deterioration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A position indicating means to indicate to the flightcrew when  the thrust reversing device--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is not in the selected position, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is in the reverse thrust position, for each engine using a  thrust reversing device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An indicator to indicate rotor system unbalance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For turbopropeller-powered airplanes. In addition to the  powerplant instruments required by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this  section, the following powerplant instruments are required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A torque indicator for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Position indicating means to indicate to the flight crew when  the propeller blade angle is below the flight low pitch position, for  each propeller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For airplanes equipped with fluid systems (other than fuel) for  thrust or power augmentation, an approved means must be provided to  indicate the proper functioning of that system to the flight crew.
