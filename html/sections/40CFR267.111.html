If you determine that, when applicable, the closure requirements of Sec.  267.201(tanks) or Sec.  267.1108 (containment buildings) cannot be met, then you must close the unit in accordance with the requirements that apply to landfills (Sec.  264.310). In addition, for the purposes of post-closure and financial responsibility, such a tank system or containment building is then considered to be a landfill, and you must apply for a post-closure care permit in accordance with 40 CFR part 270.</p>
