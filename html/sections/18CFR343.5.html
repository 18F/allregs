                            <p class="depth0">The Commission or other decisional authority may require parties to  enter into good faith negotiations to settle oil pipeline rate matters.  The Commission will refer all protested rate filings   to a settlement judge pursuant to Sec. 385.603 of this chapter for  recommended resolution. Failure to participate in such negotiations in  good faith is a ground for decision against the party so failing to  participate on any issue that is the subject of negotiation by other  parties.
