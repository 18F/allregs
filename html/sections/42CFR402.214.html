The effective date of an exclusion is not delayed beyond the date stated in the notice of exclusion simply because a request for a hearing is timely filed (see paragraph (g) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A timely filed written request for a hearing must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement as to the specific issues or findings of fact and conclusions of law in the notice of exclusion with which the person disagrees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis for the disagreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The general basis for the defenses that the person intends to assert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasons why the proposed length of exclusion should be modified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reasons, if applicable, why the health or safety of Medicare beneficiaries receiving items or services does not warrant the exclusion going into or remaining in effect before the

The excluded person has no right to appeal the exclusion other than as described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the excluded person files a written request for a hearing, and asserts in the request that the health or safety of Medicare beneficiaries does not warrant the exclusion going into or remaining in effect before completion of an ALJ hearing, then the initiating agency may make a determination as to whether the exclusion goes into effect or continues pending the outcome of the ALJ hearing.</p>
