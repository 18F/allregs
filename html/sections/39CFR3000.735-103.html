                            <p class="depth0">An employee shall not, either directly or indirectly, have any financial interest (whether by ownership of any stock, bond, security, or otherwise) in any entity or person whose interests may be significantly affected by rates of postage, fees for postage services, the classification of mail, or the operation of the Postal Service. This paragraph does not proscribe interests in an entity or person whose use of the mail is merely an incidental or a minor factor in the general conduct of its business.
