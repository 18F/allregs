                                Sec.  1068.325  What are the temporary exemptions for imported
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You may import engines/equipment under certain temporary exemptions, subject to the conditions in this section. We may ask U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require a specific bond amount to make sure you comply with the requirements of this subpart. You may not sell or lease one of these engines/equipment while it is in the United States except as specified in this section or Sec.  1068.201(i). You must eventually export the engine/equipment as we describe in this section unless it conforms to a certificate of conformity or it qualifies for one of the permanent exemptions in Sec.  1068.315.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption for repairs or alterations. You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment under bond solely for repair or alteration, subject to our advance approval as described in paragraph (j) of this section. You may operate the engine/equipment in the

United States only as necessary to repair it, alter it, or ship it to or from the service location. Export the engine/equipment directly after servicing is complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing exemption. You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment under bond for testing if you follow the requirements of Sec.  1068.210, subject to our advance approval as described in paragraph (j) of this section. You may operate the engines/equipment in the United States only as needed to perform tests. This exemption expires one year after you import the engine/equipment unless we approve an extension. The engine/equipment must be exported before the exemption expires. You may sell or lease the engines/equipment consistent with the provisions of Sec.  1068.210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Display exemption. You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment under bond for display if you follow the requirements of Sec.  1068.220, subject to our advance approval as described in paragraph (j) of this section. This exemption expires one year after you import the engine/equipment, unless we approve your request for an extension. We may approve an extension of up to one more year for each request, but no more than three years total. The engine/equipment must be exported by the time the exemption expires or directly after the display concludes, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Export exemption. You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment to export them, as described in Sec.  1068.230. You may operate the engine/equipment in the United States only as needed to prepare it for export. Label the engine/equipment as described in Sec.  1068.230. You may sell or lease the engines/equipment for operation outside the United States consistent with the provisions of Sec.  1068.230.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Diplomatic or military exemption. You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment without bond if you represent a foreign government in a diplomatic or military capacity. In your request to the Designated Compliance Officer (see Sec.  1068.305), include either written confirmation from the U.S. State Department that you qualify for this exemption or a copy of your orders for military duty in the United States. We will rely on the State Department or your military orders to determine when your diplomatic or military status expires, at which time you must export your exempt engines/equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Delegated-assembly exemption. You may import a nonconforming engine for final assembly under the provisions of Sec.  1068.261. You may sell or lease the engines/equipment consistent with the provisions of Sec.  1068.261.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exemption for partially complete engines. You may import an engine if another company already has a certificate of conformity and will be modifying the engine to be in its final certified configuration or a final exempt configuration under the provisions of Sec.  1068.262. You may also import a partially complete engine by shipping it from one of your facilities to another under the provisions of Sec.  1068.260(c). If you are importing a used engine that becomes new as a result of importation, you must meet all the requirements that apply to original engine manufacturers under Sec.  1068.262. You may sell or lease the engines consistent with the provisions of Sec.  1068.262.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)-(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Approvals. For the exemptions in this section requiring our approval, you must send a request to the Designated Compliance Officer before importing the engines/equipment. We will approve your request if you meet all the applicable requirements and conditions. If another section separately requires that you request approval for the exemption, you may combine the information requirements in a single request. Include the following information in your request:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the importer of the engine/equipment and the applicable postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the engine/equipment owner and the applicable postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the engine/equipment by model number (or name), serial number, and original production year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify the specific regulatory provision under which you are seeking an exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Authorize EPA enforcement officers to conduct inspections or testing as allowed under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include any additional information we specify for demonstrating that you qualify for the exemption.
