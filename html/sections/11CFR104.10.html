In each report disclosing a disbursement for administrative expenses, generic voter drives, or public communications that refer to any political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified candidates, as described in 11 CFR 106.6(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv), as applicable, the committee shall state the allocation ratio to be applied to each category of activity according to 11 CFR 106.6(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting of allocation of the direct costs of fundraising.
