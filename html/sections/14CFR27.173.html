                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The longitudinal control must be designed so that a rearward movement of the control is necessary to obtain an airspeed less than the trim speed, and a forward movement of the control is necessary to obtain an airspeed more than the trim speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Throughout the full range of altitude for which certification is requested, with the throttle and collective pitch held constant during the maneuvers specified in Sec. 27.175(a) through (d), the slope of the control position versus airspeed curve must be positive. However, in limited flight conditions or modes of operation determined by the Administrator to be acceptable, the slope of the control position versus airspeed curve may be neutral or negative if the rotorcraft possesses flight characteristics that allow the pilot to maintain airspeed within 5 knots of the desired trim airspeed without exceptional piloting skill or alertness.
