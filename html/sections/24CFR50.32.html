                            <p class="depth0">The program staff in the HUD office responsible for processing the project application or recommending a policy action is responsible for conducting the compliance finding, EA, or EIS. The collection of data and studies as part of the information contained in the environmental review may be done by an applicant or the applicant's contractor. The HUD program staff may use any information supplied by the applicant or contractor, provided HUD independently evaluates the information, will be responsible for its accuracy, supplements the information, if necessary, to conform to the requirements of this part, and prepares the environmental finding. Assessments for projects over 200 lots/dwelling units or beds shall be sent to the Field Environmental Clearance Officer (FECO) or, in the absence of a FECO, to the Program Environmental Clearance Officer in Headquarters for review and comment.</p>
