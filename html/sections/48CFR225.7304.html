                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such cases, FAR 6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full and open competition. The FMS customer may also request that a subcontract be placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such requests from the FMS customer only if the LOA or other written direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FMS customers should be encouraged to participate with U.S. Government acquisition personnel in discussions with industry to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Develop technical specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish delivery schedules;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify any special warranty provisions or other requirements unique to the FMS customer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review prices of varying alternatives, quantities, and options needed to make price-performance tradeoffs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Do not disclose to the FMS customer any data, including certified cost or pricing data, that is contractor proprietary unless the contractor authorizes its release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the degree of FMS customer participation in contract negotiations is left to the discretion of the contracting officer after consultation with the contractor.
