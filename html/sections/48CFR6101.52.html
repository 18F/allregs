Whenever possible, the presiding judge shall resolve an appeal under this procedure within 120 calendar days from the Board's receipt of the election. The time for processing an appeal under this procedure may be extended if the appellant has not adhered to the established schedule. Either party's failure to abide by the Board's schedule may result in the Board drawing evidentiary inferences adverse to the party at fault.
