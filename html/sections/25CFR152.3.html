                            <p class="depth0">The status of applications by Indians for patents in fee, certificates of competency, or orders removing restrictions shall be disclosed to employees of the Department of the Interior whose duties require that such information be disclosed to them; to the applicant or his attorney, upon request; and to Members of Congress who inquire on behalf of the applicant. Such information will be available to all other persons, upon request, 15 days after the fee patent has been issued by the Bureau of Land Management, or 15 days after issuance of certificate of competency or order removing restrictions, or after the application has been rejected and the applicant notified. Where the termination of the trust or restricted status of the land covered by the application would adversely affect the protection and use of Indian land remaining in trust or restricted status, the owners of the land that would be so affected may be informed that the application has been filed.</p>
