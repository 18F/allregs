                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) In general. Section 513(d) and Sec. 1.513-3(b) provide that convention and trade show activities carried on by a qualifying organization in connection with a qualified convention or trade show will not be treated as unrelated trade or business. Consequently, income from qualified convention and trade show activities, derived by a qualifying organization that

sponsors the qualified convention or trade show, will not be subject to the tax imposed by section 511. Section 1.513-3(c) defines qualifying organizations and qualified conventions or trade shows. Section 1.513-3(d) concerns the treatment of income derived from certain activities, including rental of exhibition space at a qualified convention or trade show where sales activity is permitted, and the treatment of supplier exhibits at qualified conventions and trade shows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Consequently, income from qualified convention and trade show activities, derived by a qualifying organization that

Section 1.513-3(d) concerns the treatment of income derived from certain activities, including rental of exhibition space at a qualified convention or trade show where sales activity is permitted, and the treatment of supplier exhibits at qualified conventions and trade shows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified activities not unrelated. A convention or trade show activity, as defined in section 513(d)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.513-3(c)(4), will not be considered unrelated trade or business if it is conducted by a qualifying organization described in section 513(d)(3)(C) and Sec. 1.513-3(c)(1), in conjunction with a qualified convention or trade show, as defined in section 513(d)(3)(B) and Sec. 1.513-3(c)(2), sponsored by the qualifying organization. Such an activity is a qualified convention or trade show activity. A convention or trade show activity which is conducted by an organization described in section 501(c) (5) or (6), but which otherwise is not so qualified under this section, will be considered unrelated trade or business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--(1) Qualifying organization. Under section 513(d)(3)(C), a qualifying organization is one which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualifying organization. Under section 513(d)(3)(C), a qualifying organization is one which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is described in either section 501(c) (5) or (6), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regularly conducts as one of its substantial exempt purposes a qualified convention or trade show.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualified convention or trade show. For purposes of this section, the term qualified convention or trade show means a show that meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is conducted by a qualifying organization described in section 513(d)(3)(C);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one purpose of the sponsoring organization in conducting the show is the education of its members, or the promotion and stimulation of interest in, and demand for, the products or services of the industry (or segment thereof) of the members of the qualifying organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The show is designed to achieve that purpose through the character of a significant portion of the exhibits or the character of conferences and seminars held at a convention or meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Show. For purposes of this section, the term show includes an international, national, state, regional, or local convention, annual meeting or show.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Convention and trade show activity. For purposes of this section, convention and trade show activity means any activity of a kind traditionally carried on at shows. It includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Activities designed to attract to the show members of the sponsoring organization, members of an industry in general, and members of the public, to view industry products or services and to stimulate interest in, and demand for such products or services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Activities designed to educate persons in the industry about new products or services or about new rules and regulations affecting the industry; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Incidental activities, such as furnishing refreshments, of a kind traditionally carried on at such shows.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain activities--(1) Rental of exhibition space. The rental of display space to exhibitors (including exhibitors who are suppliers) at a qualified trade show or at a qualified convention and trade show will not be considered unrelated trade or business even though the exhibitors who rent the space are permitted to sell or solicit orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rental of exhibition space. The rental of display space to exhibitors (including exhibitors who are suppliers) at a qualified trade show or at a qualified convention and trade show will not be considered unrelated trade or business even though the exhibitors who rent the space are permitted to sell or solicit orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suppliers defined. For purposes of subparagraph (1), a supplier's exhibit is one in which the exhibitor displays goods or services that are supplied to, rather than by, the members of the qualifying organization in the conduct of such members' own trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. X, an organization described in section 501(c)(6), was formed to promote the construction industry. Its membership is made up of manufacturers of heavy construction machinery many of whom own, rent, or lease one or more digital computers produced by various computer manufacturers. X is a qualifying organization under section

513(d)(3)(C) that regularly holds an annual meeting. At this meeting a national industry sales campaign and methods of consumer financing for heavy construction machinery are discussed. In addition, new construction machinery developed for use in the industry is on display with representatives of the various manufacturers present to promote their machinery. Both members and nonmembers attend this portion of the conference. In addition, manufacturers of computers are present to educate X's members. While this aspect of the conference is a supplier exhibit (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), income earned from such activity by X will not constitute unrelated business taxable income to X because the activity is conducted as part of a qualified trade show described in Sec. 1.513-3(c).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, but the only goods or services displayed are those of suppliers, the computer manufacturers. Selling and order taking are permitted. No member exhibits are maintained. Standing alone, this supplier exhibit (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) would constitute a supplier show and not a qualified convention or trade show. In this situation, however, the rental of exhibition space to suppliers is not unrelated trade or business. It is conducted by a qualifying organization in conjunction with a qualified convention or trade show. The show (the annual meeting) is a qualified convention or trade show because one of its purposes is the promotion and stimulation of interest in, and demand for, the products or services of the industry through the character of the annual meeting.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Y is an organization described in section 501(c)(6). The organization conducts an annual show at which its members exhibit their products and services in order to promote public interest in the line of business. Potential customers are invited to the show, and sales and order taking are permitted. The organization secures the exhibition facility, undertakes the planning and direction of the show, and maintains exhibits designed to promote the line of business in general. The show is a qualified convention or trade show described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The provision of exhibition space to individual members is a qualified trade show activity, and is not unrelated trade or business.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Z is an organization described in section 501(c)(6) that sponsors an annual show. As the sole activity at the show, suppliers to the members of Z exhibit their products and services for the purpose of stimulating the sale of their products. Selling and order taking are permitted. The show is a supplier show and does not meet the definition of a qualified convention show as it does not satisfy any of the three alternative bases for qualification. First, the show does not stimulate interest in the members' products through the character of product exhibits as the only products exhibited are those of suppliers rather than members. Second, the show does not stimulate interest in members' products through conferences or seminars as no such conferences are held at the show. Third, the show does not meet the definition of a qualified show on the basis of educational activities as the exhibition of suppliers' products is designed primarily to stimulate interest in, and sale of, suppliers' products. Thus, the organization's provision of exhibition space is not a qualified convention or trade show activity. Income derived from rentals of exhibition space to suppliers will be unrelated business taxable income under section 512.
