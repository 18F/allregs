Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) and the imputed floor under paragraph (h)(4) of this section are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made in the absence of such provisions as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Beginning October 1, 2008, such adjustment is transitioned from a nationwide to a statewide adjustment as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> From October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009, the wage index is a blend of 20 percent of a wage index with a statewide adjustment and 80 percent of a wage index with a nationwide adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010, the wage index is a blend of 50 percent of a wage index with a statewide adjustment and 50 percent of a wage index with a nationwide adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning October 1, 2010, such adjustment is a full nationwide adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Adjustment for outlier payments. CMS reduces the adjusted average standardized amount determined under paragraph (c) through (e) of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) to the total amount of payments based on DRG prospective payment rates that are additional payments for outlier cases under subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Computing Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for hospitals located in all areas. For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS establishes for the fiscal year a national prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs based on the standardized amount for the fiscal year and the weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that DRG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Adjusting for different area wage levels. CMS adjusts the proportion of the Federal rate for inpatient operating costs that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs. The adjustment described in this paragraph (h) also takes into account the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The wage index is updated annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CMS determines the proportion of the Federal rate that is attributable to wages and labor-related costs from time to time, employing a methodology that is described in the annual regulation updating the system of payment for inpatient hospital operating costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS employs 62 percent as the proportion of the rate that is adjusted for the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs, unless employing that percentage would result in lower payments for the hospital than employing the proportion determined under the methodology described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For discharges on or after October 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2016, CMS establishes a minimum wage index for each all-urban State, as defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this section. This minimum wage index value is computed using the following methodology:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS computes the ratio of the lowest-to-highest wage index for each all-urban State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CMS computes the average of the ratios of the lowest-to-highest wage indexes of all the all-urban States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each all-urban State, CMS determines the higher of the State's own lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) or the average lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each State, CMS multiplies the rate determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section by the highest wage index value in the State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The product determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section is the minimum wage index value for the State, except as provided under paragraph (h)(4)(vi) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For discharges on or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2016, the minimum wage index value for the

State is the higher of the value determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section or the value computed using the following alternative methodology:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CMS estimates a percentage representing the average percentage increase in wage index for hospitals receiving the rural floor due to such floor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each all-urban State, CMS makes a onetime determination of the lowest hospital wage index in the State (including all adjustments to the hospital's wage index, except for the rural floor, the rural floor budget neutrality, and the outmigration adjustment) and increases this wage index by the percentage determined under paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(A) of this section, the result of which establishes the alternative minimum wage index value for the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An all-urban State is a State with no rural areas, as defined in this section, or a State in which there are no hospitals classified as rural. A State with rural areas and with hospitals reclassified as rural under Sec. 412.103 in not an all-urban State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a new rural hospital that is subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system opens in a State that has an imputed rural floor and has rural areas, CMS uses the imputed floor as the hospital's wage index until the hospital's first cost report as an inpatient prospective payment system provider is contemporaneous with the cost reporting period being used to develop a given fiscal year's wage index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adjusting the wage index to account for commuting patterns of hospital workers--(1) General criteria. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS adjusts the hospital wage index for hospitals located in qualifying counties to recognize the commuting patterns of hospital employees. A qualifying county is a county that meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General criteria. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS adjusts the hospital wage index for hospitals located in qualifying counties to recognize the commuting patterns of hospital employees. A qualifying county is a county that meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hospital employees in the county commute to work in an MSA (or MSAs) with a wage index (or wage indices) higher than the wage index of the MSA or rural statewide area in which the county is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least 10 percent of the county's hospital employees commute to an MSA (or MSAs) with a higher wage index (or wage indices).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The 3-year average hourly wage of the hospital(s) in the county equals or exceeds the 3-year average hourly wage of all hospitals in the MSA or rural statewide area in which the county is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of adjustment. A hospital located in a county that meets the criteria under paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iii) of this section will receive an increase in its wage index that is equal to a weighted average of the difference between the postreclassified wage index of the MSA (or MSAs) with the higher wage index (or wage indices) and the postreclassified wage index of the MSA or rural statewide area in which the qualifying county is located, weighted by the overall percentage of the hospital employees residing in the qualifying county who are employed in any MSA with a higher wage index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Process for determining the adjustment. (i) CMS will use the most accurate data available, as determined by CMS, to determine the out-migration percentage for each county.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS will use the most accurate data available, as determined by CMS, to determine the out-migration percentage for each county.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CMS will include, in its annual proposed and final notices of updates to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, a listing of qualifying counties and the hospitals that are eligible to receive the adjustment to their wage indexes for commuting hospital employees, and the wage index increase applicable to each qualifying county.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any wage index adjustment made under this paragraph (i) is effective for a period of 3 fiscal years, except that hospitals in a qualifying county may elect to waive the application of the wage index adjustment. A hospital may waive the application of the wage index adjustment by notifying CMS in writing within 45 days after the publication of the annual notice of proposed rulemaking for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A hospital in a qualifying county that receives a wage index adjustment under this paragraph (i) is not eligible for reclassification under subpart L of this part or section 1886(d)(8) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Wage index assignment for rural referral centers for FY 2005.

an exception to the wage index assignment of a rural referral center for FY 2005 if the rural referral center meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CMS makes

an exception to the wage index assignment of a rural referral center for FY 2005 if the rural referral center meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rural referral center was reclassified for FY 2004 by the MGCRB to another MSA, but, upon applying to the MGCRB for FY 2005, was found to be ineligible for reclassification because its average hourly wage was less than 84 percent (but greater than 82 percent) of the average hourly wage of the hospitals geographically located in the MSA to which the rural referral center applied for reclassification for FY 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hospital may not qualify for any geographic reclassification under subpart L of this part, effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CMS will assign a rural referral center that meets the conditions of paragraph (j)(1) of this section the wage index value of the MSA to which it was reclassified by the MGCRB in FY 2004.
