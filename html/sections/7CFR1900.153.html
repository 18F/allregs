A Rural Development employee who knows he or she is related to or associated with an applicant or recipient, regardless of whether the relationship or association is known to others, is required to notify the Rural Development official who is processing or servicing the assistance, in writing. RD Guide Letter 1900-D-1 (available in any RD office) may be used as the notice. If the appropriate official is not known, the State Director should be notified. Regardless of whether the relationship or association is defined in Sec.  1900.152, if the employee believes there may be a potential conflict of interest, the Rural Development official who is processing or servicing the assistance may be notified and special handling requested. An employee's request that the case receive special handling is usually honored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility of the Rural Development official.
