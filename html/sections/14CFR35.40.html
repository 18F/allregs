                            <p class="depth0">The variable-pitch propeller system must be subjected to the  applicable functional tests of this section. The same propeller system  used in the endurance test (Sec. 35.39) must be used in the functional  tests and must be driven by a representative engine on a test stand or  on an airplane. The propeller must complete these tests without evidence  of failure or malfunction. This test may be combined with the endurance  test for accumulation of cycles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manually-controllable propellers. Five hundred representative  flight cycles must be made across the range of pitch and rotational  speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Governing propellers. Fifteen hundred complete cycles must be  made across the range of pitch and rotational speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Feathering propellers. Fifty cycles of feather and unfeather  operation must be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reversible-pitch propellers. Two hundred complete cycles of  control must be made from lowest normal pitch to maximum reverse pitch.  During each cycle, the propeller must run for 30 seconds at the maximum  power and rotational speed selected by the applicant for maximum reverse  pitch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An analysis based on tests of propellers of similar design may  be used in place of the tests of this section.
