If the appeal is denied in whole or part, the  person making the request shall be immediately notified of the decisions  and of the provisions for judicial review of the Agency's denial of the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event a determination is not issued within the applicable  time limit and the person making the request therefore chooses to sue  the Agency, the Agency-level determination process shall nonetheless  continue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an appeal not properly marked ``FOIA Appeal'' on the text of  the appeal and/or envelope is thereby delayed in reaching the Appeals  Officer, it will not be deemed received by the Appeals Officer until  actually received by him/her.
