                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The PHA must establish utility allowances for manufactured home  space rental. For the first twelve months of the initial lease term  only, the allowances must include a reasonable amount for utility hook- up charges payable by the family if the family actually incurs the  expenses because of a move. Allowances for utility hook-up charges do  not apply to a family that leases a manufactured home space in place.  Utility allowances for manufactured home space must not cover costs  payable by a family to cover the digging of a well or installation of a  septic system.</p><p class="depth0">Homeownership Option</p><p class="depth0">Source: 65 FR 55163, Sept. 12, 2000, unless otherwise noted.</p>
