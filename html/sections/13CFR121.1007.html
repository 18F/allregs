                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Particular procurement. A protest challenging the size of a  concern which does not pertain to a particular procurement or sale will  not be acted on by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A protest must include specific facts. A protest must be  sufficiently specific to provide reasonable notice as to the grounds  upon which the protested concern's size is questioned. Some basis for  the belief or allegation stated in the protest must be given. A protest  merely alleging that the protested concern is not small or is affiliated  with unnamed other concerns does not specify adequate grounds for the  protest. No particular form is prescribed for a protest. Where materials  supporting the protest are available, they should be submitted with the  protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-specific protests will be dismissed. Protests which do not  contain sufficient specificity will be dismissed by SBA. The following  are examples of allegation specificity:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: An allegation that concern X is large because it employs  more than 500 employees (where 500 employees is the applicable size  standard) without setting forth a basis for the allegation is non- specific.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: An allegation that concern X is large because it exceeds  the 500 employee size standard (where 500 employees is the applicable  size standard) because a higher employment figure was published in  publication Y is sufficiently specific.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: An allegation that concern X is affiliated with concern Y  without setting forth any basis for the allegation is non-specific.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4: An allegation that concern X is affiliated with concern Y  because Mr. A is the majority shareholder in both concerns is  sufficiently specific.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5: An allegation that concern X has revenues in excess of $5  million (where $5 million is the applicable size standard) without  setting forth a basis for the allegation is non-specific.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6: An allegation that concern X exceeds the size standard  (where the applicable size standard is $5 million) because it received  Government contracts in excess of $5 million last year is sufficiently  specific.
