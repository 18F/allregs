                            <p class="depth0">Affiliation. This term normally appears as ``affiliate of'', or ``affiliated with'', and means a person such as a producer or handler who is: A producer or handler that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, owns or controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with the producer or handler specified; or a producer or handler that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, is connected in a proprietary capacity, or shares the ownership or control of the specified producer or handler with one or more other producers or handlers. As used in this part, the term ``control'' (including the terms ``controlling'', ``controlled by'', and ``under the common control with'') means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a handler or a producer, whether through voting securities, membership in a cooperative, by contract or otherwise.</p>
