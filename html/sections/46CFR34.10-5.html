In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be arranged so that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and any other services installed on the fire main can be met simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> On all vessels where two fire pumps are required, they shall be located in separate spaces, and the arrangement of pumps, sea connections, and sources of power shall be such as to insure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement due to the size, or arrangement of the vessel, or for other reasons, the installation of a total flooding carbon dioxide system may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire which would affect the powering and operation of at least one of the required fire pumps.
