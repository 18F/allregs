An Enterprise or commenter may  designate specific information as confidential and request that it not  be made publicly available. For any information that an Enterprise or  commenter seeks confidential treatment, the Enterprise or commenter is  required to submit a complete copy of the Notice or comment, with a  specific request for confidential treatment. Simultaneously, the  Enterprise or commenter is required to submit a copy of the Notice or  comment containing only those portions for which no request for  confidential treatment is made, and from which those portions for which  confidential treatment is requested have been redacted. The Enterprise  or   commenter must specify the bases for designated information not being  made public as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required information.
