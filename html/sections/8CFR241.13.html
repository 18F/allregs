                                Sec. 241.13  Determination of whether there is a significant likelihood
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section establishes special review procedures for  those aliens who are subject to a final order of removal and are  detained under the custody review procedures provided at Sec. 241.4  after the expiration of the removal period, where the alien has provided  good reason to believe there is no significant likelihood of removal to  the country to which he or she was ordered removed, or to a third  country, in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability to particular aliens--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relationship to Sec.  241.4. Section 241.4 shall continue to govern the detention of aliens  under a final order of removal, including aliens who have requested a  review of the likelihood of their removal under this section, unless the  Service makes a determination under this section that there is no  significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.  The Service may release an alien under an order of supervision under  Sec. 241.4 if it determines that the alien would not pose a danger to  the public or a risk of flight, without regard to the likelihood of the  alien's removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continued detention pending determinations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Service's  Headquarters Post-order Detention Unit (HQPDU) shall continue in custody  any alien described in paragraph (a) of this section during the time the  Service is pursuing the procedures of this section to determine whether  there is no significant likelihood the alien can be removed in the  reasonably foreseeable future. The HQPDU shall continue in custody any  alien described in paragraph (a) of this section for whom it has  determined that special circumstances exist and custody procedures under  Sec. 241.14 have been initiated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The HQPDU has no obligation to release an alien under this  section until the HQPDU has had the opportunity during a six-month  period, dating from the beginning of the removal period (whenever that  period begins and unless that period is extended as provided in section  241(a)(1) of the Act), to make its determination as to whether there is  a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable  future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitations. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arriving aliens, including those who have not entered the United  States, those who have been granted immigration parole into the United  States, and Mariel Cubans whose parole is governed by Sec. 212.12 of  this chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aliens subject to a final order of removal who are still within  the removal period, including aliens whose removal period has been  extended for failure to comply with the requirements of section  241(a)(1)(C) of the Act; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Aliens who are ordered removed by the Alien Terrorist Removal  Court pursuant to title 5 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delegation of authority. The HQPDU shall conduct a review under  this section, in response to a request from a detained alien, in order  to determine whether there is no significant likelihood that the alien  will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. If so, the HQPDU  shall determine whether the alien should be released from custody under  appropriate conditions of supervision or should be referred for a  determination under Sec. 241.14 as to whether the alien's continued  detention may be justified by special circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Showing by the alien--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written request. An eligible alien may  submit a written request for release to the HQPDU asserting the basis  for the alien's belief that there is no significant likelihood that the  alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future . The alien  may submit whatever documentation to the HQPDU he or she wishes in  support of the assertion that there is no significant likelihood of  removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance and cooperation with removal efforts. The alien shall  include with the written request information sufficient to establish his  or her compliance with the obligation to effect his or her removal and  to cooperate in the process of obtaining necessary travel documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Timing of request. An eligible alien subject to a final order of  removal may submit, at any time after the removal order becomes final, a  written request under this section asserting that his or her removal is  not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future. However,  the Service may, in the exercise of its discretion, postpone its  consideration of such a request until after expiration of the removal  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review by HQPDU--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial response. Within 10 business days  after the HQPDU receives the request (or, if later, the expiration of  the removal period), the HQPDU shall respond in writing to the alien,  with a copy to counsel of record, by regular mail, acknowledging receipt  of the request for a review under this section and explaining the  procedures that will be used to evaluate the request. The notice shall  advise the alien that the Service may continue to detain the alien until  it has made a determination under this section whether there is a  significant likelihood the alien can be removed in the reasonably  foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lack of compliance, failure to cooperate. The HQPDU shall first  determine if the alien has failed to make reasonable efforts to comply  with the removal order, has failed to cooperate fully in effecting  removal, or has obstructed or hampered the removal process. If so, the  HQPDU shall so advise the alien in writing, with a copy to counsel of  record by regular mail. The HQPDU shall advise the alien of the efforts  he or she needs to make in order to assist in securing travel documents  for return to his or her country of origin or a third country, as well  as the consequences of failure to make such efforts or to cooperate,  including the provisions of section 243(a) of the Act. The Service shall  not be obligated to conduct a further consideration of the alien's  request for release until the alien has responded to the HQPDU and has  established his or her compliance with the statutory requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Referral to the State Department. If the HQPDU believes that the  alien's request provides grounds for further review, the Service may, in  the exercise of its discretion, forward a copy of the alien's release  request to the Department of State for information and assistance. The  Department of State may provide detailed country conditions information  or any other information that may be relevant to whether a travel  document is obtainable from the country at issue. The Department of  State may also provide an assessment of the accuracy of the alien's  assertion that he or she cannot be returned to the country at issue or  to a third country. When the Service bases its decision, in whole or in  part, on information provided by the Department of State, that  information shall be made part of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Response by alien. The Service shall permit the alien an  opportunity to respond to the evidence on which the Service intends to  rely, including the Department of State's submission, if any, and other  evidence of record presented by the Service prior to any   HQPDU decision. The alien may provide any additional relevant  information to the Service, including reasons why his or her removal  would not be significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future  even though the Service has generally been able to accomplish the  removal of other aliens to the particular country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Interview. The HQPDU may grant the alien an interview, whether  telephonically or in person, if the HQPDU determines that an interview  would provide assistance in reaching a decision. If an interview is  scheduled, the HQPDU will provide an interpreter upon its determination  that such assistance is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special circumstances. If the Service determines that there are  special circumstances justifying the alien's continued detention  nowithstanding the determination that removal is not significantly  likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Service shall initiate  the review procedures in Sec. 241.14, and provide written notice to the  alien. In appropriate cases, the Service may initiate review proceedings  under Sec. 241.14 before completing the HQPDU review under this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Factors for consideration. The HQPDU shall consider all the  facts of the case including, but not limited to, the history of the  alien's efforts to comply with the order of removal, the history of the  Service's efforts to remove aliens to the country in question or to  third countries, including the ongoing nature of the Service's efforts  to remove this alien and the alien's assistance with those efforts, the  reasonably foreseeable results of those efforts, and the views of the  Department of State regarding the prospects for removal of aliens to the  country or countries in question. Where the Service is continuing its  efforts to remove the alien, there is no presumptive period of time  within which the alien's removal must be accomplished, but the prospects  for the timeliness of removal must be reasonable under the  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Decision. The HQPDU shall issue a written decision based on the  administrative record, including any documentation provided by the  alien, regarding the likelihood of removal and whether there is a  significant likelihood that the alien will be removed in the reasonably  foreseeable future under the circumstances. The HQPDU shall provide the  decision to the alien, with a copy to counsel of record, by regular  mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Finding of no significant likelihood of removal. If the HQPDU  determines at the conclusion of the review that there is no significant  likelihood that the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable  future, despite the Service's and the alien's efforts to effect removal,  then the HQPDU shall so advise the alien. Unless there are special  circumstances justifying continued detention, the Service shall promptly  make arrangements for the release of the alien subject to appropriate  conditions, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. The Service  may require that the alien submit to a medical or psychiatric  examination prior to establishing appropriate conditions for release or  determining whether to refer the alien for further proceedings under  Sec. 214.14 because of special circumstances justifying continued  detention. The Service is not required to release an alien if the alien  refuses to submit to a medical or psychiatric examination as ordered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial. If the HQPDU determines at the conclusion of the review  that there is a significant likelihood that the alien will be removed in  the reasonably foreseeable future, the HQPDU shall deny the alien's  request under this section. The denial shall advise the alien that his  or her detention will continue to be governed under the established  standards in Sec. 214.4. There is no administrative appeal from the  HQPDU decision denying a request from an alien under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Conditions of release--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An alien's release  pursuant to an HQPDU determination that the alien's removal is not  significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future shall be upon  appropriate conditions specified in this paragraph and in the order of  supervision, in order to protect the public safety and to promote the  ability of the Service to effect the alien's removal as ordered, or  removal to a third country, should circumstances   change in the future. The order of supervision shall include all of the  conditions provided in section 241(a)(3) of the Act, and Sec. 241.5,  and shall also include the conditions that the alien obey all laws,  including any applicable prohibitions on the possession or use of  firearms (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 922(g)); and that the alien continue to  seek to obtain travel documents and provide the Service with all  correspondence to Embassies/Consulates requesting the issuance of travel  documents and any reply from the Embassy/Consulate. The order of  supervision may also include any other conditions that the HQPDU  considers necessary to ensure public safety and guarantee the alien's  compliance with the order of removal, including, but not limited to,  attendance at any rehabilitative/sponsorship program or submission for  medical or psychiatric examination, as ordered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advice of consequences for violating conditions of release. The  order of supervision shall advise an alien released under this section  that he or she must abide by the conditions of release specified by the  Service. The order of supervision shall also advise the alien of the  consequences of violation of the conditions of release, including the  authority to return the alien to custody and the sanctions provided in  section 243(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employment authorization. The Service may, in the exercise of  its discretion, grant employment authorization under the same conditions  set forth in Sec. 241.5(c) for aliens released under an order of  supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawal of release approval. The Service may, in the exercise  of its discretion, withdraw approval for release of any alien under this  section prior to release in order to effect removal in the reasonably  foreseeable future or where the alien refuses to comply with the  conditions of release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Revocation of release--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Violation of conditions of release.  Any alien who has been released under an order of supervision under this  section who violates any of the conditions of release may be returned to  custody and is subject to the penalties described in section 243(b) of  the Act. In suitable cases, the HQPDU shall refer the case to the  appropriate U.S. Attorney for criminal prosecution. The alien may be  continued in detention for an additional six months in order to effect  the alien's removal, if possible, and to effect the conditions under  which the alien had been released.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revocation for removal. The Service may revoke an alien's  release under this section and return the alien to custody if, on  account of changed circumstances, the Service determines that there is a  significant likelihood that the alien may be removed in the reasonably  foreseeable future. Thereafter, if the alien is not released from  custody following the informal interview provided for in paragraph  (h)(3) of this section, the provisions of Sec. 241.4 shall govern the  alien's continued detention pending removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revocation procedures. Upon revocation, the alien will be  notified of the reasons for revocation of his or her release. The  Service will conduct an initial informal interview promptly after his or  her return to Service custody to afford the alien an opportunity to  respond to the reasons for revocation stated in the notification. The  alien may submit any evidence or information that he or she believes  shows there is no significant likelihood he or she be removed in the  reasonably foreseeable future, or that he or she has not violated the  order of supervision. The revocation custody review will include an  evaluation of any contested facts relevant to the revocation and a  determination whether the facts as determined warrant revocation and  further denial of release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Subsequent requests for review. If the Service has denied an  alien's request for release under this section, the alien may submit a  request for review of his or her detention under this section, six  months after the Service's last denial of release under this section.  After applying the procedures in this section, the HQPDU shall consider  any additional evidence provided by the alien or available to the  Service as well as the evidence in the prior proceedings but the HQPDC  shall render a de novo decision on the likelihood of removing the alien  in the reasonably   foreseeable future under the circumstances.
