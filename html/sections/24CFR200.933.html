                            <p class="depth0">Changes in the Minimum Property Standards will generally be made  every three years. Changes will be made in accordance with HUD policy  for the adoption of rules and regulations set forth in part 10 of this  title. Notice of such changes will be published in the Federal Register.  As the changes are made, they will be incorporated into the volumes of  the Minimum Property Standards to which they apply. The volumes  available for public examination and for purchase will contain all  changes up to the date of examination or purchase. An official, historic  file of such changes will be available in the office of the Rules Docket  Clerk in the HUD Central Office in Washington, DC,   and in each HUD Regional, Area, and Insuring Office. A similar copy of  the standards will also be maintained in the Office of the Federal  Register, Washington, DC.  [39 FR 26895, July 24, 1974, as amended at 58 FR 60250, Nov. 15, 1993]</p>
