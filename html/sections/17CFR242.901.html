Appendix to 17 CFR 242.901 Reports Regarding the Establishment of Block</p><p class="depth0">Thresholds and Reporting Delays for Regulatory Reporting of Security-</p><p class="depth0">Based Swap Transaction Data</p><p class="depth0">This appendix sets forth guidelines applicable to reports that the Commission has directed its staff to make in connection with the determination of block thresholds and reporting delays for security-based swap transaction data. The Commission intends to use these reports to inform its specification of the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and the appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public in order to implement regulatory requirements under Section 13 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m). In producing these reports, the staff shall consider security-based swap data collected by the Commission pursuant to other Title VII rules, as well as any other applicable information as the staff may determine to be appropriate for its analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Report topics. As appropriate, based on the availability of data and information, the reports should address the following topics for each asset class:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Price impact. In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should assess the effect of notional amount and observed reporting delay on price impact of trades in the security-based swap market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hedging. In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should consider potential relationships between observed reporting delays and the incidence and cost of hedging large trades in the security-based swap market, and whether these relationships differ for interdealer trades and dealer to customer trades.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Price efficiency. In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should assess the relationship between reporting delays and the speed with which transaction information is impounded into market prices, estimating this relationship for trades of different notional amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other topics. Any other analysis of security-based swap data and information, such as security-based swap market liquidity and price volatility, that the Commission or the staff deem relevant to the specification of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing of reports. Each report shall be complete no later than two years following the initiation of public dissemination of security-based swap transaction data by the first registered SDR in that asset class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Public comment on the report. Following completion of the report, the report shall be published in the Federal Register for public comment.</p>
