If an application  is denied, the FMCSA will set forth the basis for its action in a  decision or letter notice. If parties with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety  fitness ratings consummate a transaction pursuant to the 10-day rule at  Sec. 365.405 of this part prior to the notification of FMCSA action,  they do so at their own risk and subject to any conditions we may impose  subsequently. Transactions that have been consummated but later are  denied by the FMCSA are null and void and must be rescinded. Similarly,  if applications contain false or misleading information, they are void  ab initio.
