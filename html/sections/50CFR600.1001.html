                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Council, the Governor of a State under whose authority a  proposed reduction fishery is subject, or a majority of permit holders  in the fishery may request that NMFS conduct a program in that fishery.  Each request shall be in writing. Each request shall satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 600.1003 or Sec. 600.1005, as applicable, and  enable NMFS to make the determinations required by Sec. 600.1004 or  Sec. 600.1006, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NMFS cannot conduct a program in any fishery subject to the  jurisdiction of a Council or a state unless NMFS first receives a  request from the   Council or the governor to whose jurisdiction the fishery is subject.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For a fishery subject to the jurisdiction of a Council, only  that Council can or must make the request. If the fishery is subject to  the jurisdiction of two or more Councils, those Councils must make a  joint request. No Council may make a request, or join in making a  request, until after the Council conducts a public hearing about the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For a fishery subject to the jurisdiction of a State, only the  Governor of that State can make the request. If the fishery is subject  to the jurisdiction of two or more states, the Governors of those States  shall make a joint request. No Governor of a State may make a request,  or join in making a request, until the State conducts a public hearing  about the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For a fishery under the direct management authority of the  Secretary, NMFS may conduct a program on NMFS' own motion by fulfilling  the requirements of this subpart that reasonably apply to a program not  initiated by a request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where necessary to accommodate special circumstances in a  particular fishery, NMFS may waive, as NMFS deems necessary and  appropriate, compliance with any specific requirements under this  subpart not required by statute.
