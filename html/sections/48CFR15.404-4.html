                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This subsection prescribes policies for establishing  the profit or fee portion of the Government prenegotiation objective in  price negotiations based on cost analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives do not necessarily  represent net income to contractors. Rather, they represent that element  of the potential total remuneration that contractors may receive for  contract performance over and above allowable costs. This potential  remuneration element and the Government's estimate of allowable costs to  be incurred in contract performance together equal the Government's  total prenegotiation objective. Just as actual costs may vary from  estimated costs, the contractor's actual realized profit or fee may vary  from negotiated profit or fee, because of such factors as efficiency of  performance, incurrence of costs the Government does not recognize as  allowable, and the contract type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is in the Government's interest to offer contractors  opportunities for financial rewards sufficient to stimulate efficient  contract performance, attract the best capabilities of qualified large  and small business concerns to Government contracts, and maintain a  viable industrial base.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Both the Government and contractors should be concerned with  profit as a motivator of efficient and effective contract performance.  Negotiations aimed merely at reducing prices by reducing profit, without  proper recognition of the function of profit, are not in the  Government's interest. Negotiation of extremely low profits, use of  historical averages, or automatic application of predetermined  percentages to total estimated costs do not provide proper motivation  for optimum contract performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Structured approaches (see paragraph (d) of this  subsection) for determining profit or fee prenegotiation objectives  provide a discipline for ensuring that all relevant factors are  considered. Subject to the authorities in 1.301(c), agencies making  noncompetitive contract awards over $100,000 totaling $50 million or  more a year--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall use a structured approach for determining the profit or  fee objective in those acquisitions that require cost analysis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May prescribe specific exemptions for situations in which  mandatory use of a structured approach would be clearly inappropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies may use another agency's structured approach.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting officer responsibilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the price  negotiation is not based on cost analysis, contracting officers are not  required to analyze profit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the price negotiation is based on cost analysis,  contracting officers in agencies that have a structured approach shall  use it to analyze profit. When not using a structured approach,  contracting officers shall comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this  subsection in developing profit or fee prenegotiation objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contracting officers shall use the Government prenegotiation  cost objective amounts as the basis for calculating the profit or fee  prenegotiation objective. Before applying profit or fee factors, the  contracting officer shall exclude from the pre-negotiation cost  objective amounts the purchase cost of contractor-acquired property that  is categorized as equipment, as defined in FAR 45.101, and where such  equipment is to be charged directly to the contract. Before applying  profit or fee factors, the contracting officer shall exclude any  facilities capital cost of money included in the cost objective amounts.  If the prospective contractor fails to identify or propose facilities  capital cost of money in a proposal for a contract that will be subject  to the cost principles for contracts with commercial organizations (see  subpart 31.2), facilities capital cost of money will not be an allowable  cost in any resulting contract (see 15.408(i)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer shall not negotiate a price or fee  that exceeds the following statutory limitations, imposed by 10 U.S.C.  2306(d) and 41 U.S.C. 3905):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For experimental, developmental, or research work performed  under a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, the fee shall not exceed 15  percent of the contract's estimated cost, excluding fee.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For architect-engineer services for public works or utilities,  the contract price or the estimated cost and fee for production and  delivery of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications shall not  exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of construction of the public  work or utility, excluding fees.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For other cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, the fee shall not  exceed 10 percent of the contract's estimated cost, excluding fee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer's signature on the price negotiation  memorandum or other documentation supporting determination of fair and  reasonable price documents the contracting officer's determination that  the statutory price or fee limitations have not been exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The contracting officer shall not require any prospective  contractor to submit breakouts or supporting rationale for its profit or  fee objective but may consider it, if it is submitted voluntarily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a change or modification calls for essentially the same type  and mix of work as the basic contract and is of relatively small dollar  value compared to the total contract value, the contracting officer may  use the basic contract's profit or fee rate as the prenegotiation  objective for that change or modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (vi) of this subsection shall be considered  by agencies in developing their structured approaches and by contracting  officers in analyzing profit, whether or not using a structured  approach.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> (A) through  (D) of this subsection shall be considered in determining contractor  effort, but they may be modified in specific situations to accommodate  differences in the categories used by prospective contractors for  listing costs--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Material acquisition. This subfactor measures the managerial and  technical effort needed to obtain the required purchased parts and  material, subcontracted items, and special tooling. Considerations  include the complexity of the items required, the number of purchase  orders and subcontracts to be awarded and administered, whether  established sources are   available or new or second sources must be developed, and whether  material will be obtained through routine purchase orders or through  complex subcontracts requiring detailed specifications. Profit  consideration should correspond to the managerial and technical effort  involved.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Conversion direct labor. This subfactor measures the  contribution of direct engineering, manufacturing, and other labor to  converting the raw materials, data, and subcontracted items into the  contract items. Considerations include the diversity of engineering,  scientific, and manufacturing labor skills required and the amount and  quality of supervision and coordination needed to perform the contract  task.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Conversion-related indirect costs. This subfactor measures how  much the indirect costs contribute to contract performance. The labor  elements in the allocable indirect costs should be given the profit  consideration they would receive if treated as direct labor. The other  elements of indirect costs should be evaluated to determine whether they  merit only limited profit consideration because of their routine nature,  or are elements that contribute significantly to the proposed contract.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> General management. This subfactor measures the prospective  contractor's other indirect costs and general and administrative (G&A;)  expense, their composition, and how much they contribute to contract  performance. Considerations include how labor in the overhead pools  would be treated if it were direct labor, whether elements within the  pools are routine expenses or instead are elements that contribute  significantly to the proposed contract, and whether the elements require  routine as opposed to unusual managerial effort and attention.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contract cost risk. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> This factor measures the degree of cost  responsibility and associated risk that the prospective contractor will  assume as a result of the contract type contemplated and considering the  reliability of the cost estimate in relation to the complexity and  duration of the contract task. Determination of contract type should be  closely related to the risks involved in timely, cost-effective, and  efficient performance. This factor should compensate contractors  proportionately for assuming greater cost risks.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The contractor assumes the greatest cost risk in a closely  priced firm-fixed-price contract under which it agrees to perform a  complex undertaking on time and at a predetermined price. Some firm- fixed-price contracts may entail substantially less cost risk than  others because, for example, the contract task is less complex or many  of the contractor's costs are known at the time of price agreement, in  which case the risk factor should be reduced accordingly. The contractor  assumes the least cost risk in a cost-plus-fixed-fee level-of-effort  contract, under which it is reimbursed those costs determined to be  allocable and allowable, plus the fixed fee.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In evaluating assumption of cost risk, contracting officers  shall, except in unusual circumstances, treat time-and-materials, labor- hour, and firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contracts as cost-plus- fixed-fee contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Federal socioeconomic programs. This factor measures the  degree of support given by the prospective contractor to Federal  socioeconomic programs, such as those involving small business concerns,  small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals, women-owned small business  concerns, veteran-owned, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned small  business concerns, sheltered workshops for workers with disabilities,  and energy conservation. Greater profit opportunity should be provided  contractors that have displayed unusual initiative in these programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Capital investments. This factor takes into account the  contribution of contractor investments to efficient and economical  contract performance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cost-control and other past accomplishments. This factor allows  additional profit opportunities to a prospective contractor that has  previously demonstrated its ability to perform similar tasks effectively  and economically. In addition, consideration should be given to measures  taken by the prospective contractor that result in productivity  improvements, and other cost-reduction accomplishments that   will benefit the Government in follow-on contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Independent development. Under this factor, the contractor may  be provided additional profit opportunities in recognition of  independent development efforts relevant to the contract end item  without Government assistance. The contracting officer should consider  whether the development cost was recovered directly or indirectly from  Government sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional factors. In order to foster achievement of program  objectives, each agency may include additional factors in its structured  approach or take them into account in the profit analysis of individual  contract actions.
