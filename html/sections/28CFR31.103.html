                            <p class="depth0">The State advisory group appointed under section 223(a)(3) may operate as the supervisory board for the State agency, at the discretion of the Governor. Where, however, a State has continuously maintained a broad-based law enforcement and criminal justice supervisory board (council) meeting all the requirements of section 402(b)(2) of the Justice System Improvement Act of 1979, and wishes to maintain such a board, such composition shall continue to be acceptable provided that the board's membership includes the chairman and at least two additional citizen members of the State advisory group. For purposes of this requirement a citizen member is defined as any person who is not a full-time government employee or elected official. Any executive committee of such a board must include the same proportion of juvenile justice advisory group members as are included in the total board membership. Any other proposed supervisory board membership is subject to case by case review and approval of the OJJDP Administrator and will require, at a minimum, ``balanced representation'' of juvenile justice interests.</p><p class="depth0">General Requirements</p>
