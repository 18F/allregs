                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the  best   price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government  recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and  there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant  data and determine price reasonableness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price  reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation  with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's  commercial customers. When determining the Government's price  negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic  purchases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts  and concessions offered to commercial customers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Length of the contract period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the  purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ordering and delivery practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other relevant information, including differences between  the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may  warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the  most favored commercial customer(s). For example, an offeror may incur  more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives  the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor,  original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best  price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the  Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in the  discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best price  is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify  and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require offerors to  provide detailed cost breakdowns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may award a contract containing pricing which is less  favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial  customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of  the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable,  even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.</p>
