detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), provided the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each dual mechanical seal system must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operated with the barrier fluid at a pressure that is at all times greater than the pump stuffing box pressure, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is connected by a closed-vent system to a control device that complies with the requirements of Sec. 265.1060, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Equipped with a system that purges the barrier fluid into a hazardous waste stream with no detectable emissions to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The barrier fluid system must not be a hazardous waste with organic concentrations 10 percent or greater by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each barrier fluid system must be equipped with a sensor that will detect failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each pump must be checked by visual inspection, each calendar week, for indications of liquids dripping from the pump seals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em> Each sensor as described in paragraph

that is designated, as described in Sec. 265.1064(g)(2), for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section if the pump meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must have no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must operate with no detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as measured by the methods specified in Sec. 265.1063(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must be tested for compliance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section initially upon designation, annually, and at other times as requested by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If any pump is equipped with a closed-vent system capable of capturing and transporting any leakage from the seal or seals to a control device that complies with the requirements of Sec. 265.1060, it is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
