                            <p class="depth0">The minimum manufacturing and activity requirement prescribed in  Sec. 40.61(c) of this part is a continuing condition of a  manufacturer's permit, that is, a permit to manufacture tobacco products  is conditioned upon a person's principal business activity being the  manufacture of tobacco products. A permit may be suspended, and  subsequently revoked, if the person's principal business activity under  such permit is to receive or transfer tobacco products in bond, or if  the person has no activity under such permit for a period of one year.  As a minimum activity requirement, the quantity of tobacco products  manufactured under the permit must be equivalent to, or exceed, the  quantity transferred or received in bond under the permit.
