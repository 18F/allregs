Prior to the submittal, automobile and light-duty truck coating operations were to have complied with final control limits of Sec. A115.191(a)(8)(B) of the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP), by December 31, 1986. In the December 13, 1988, submittal, the final control limits had been moved to Sec. 115.191(a)(8)(A) and had been given a new extended compliance date of December 31, 1987. EPA does not recognize the later compliance data and retains the original compliance date for the final emission limits of December 31, 1986. The owner or operator of an automobile and light-duty truck coating operation shall comply with the requirements of TACB rule 115.191(a)(8)(A) no later than December 31, 1986.
