                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Administrative. Violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder are subject to the administrative sanctions described in this section and to any other liability, sanction, or penalty available under law. The protective administrative measures that are described in Sec. 764.6 of this part are distinct from administrative sanctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Civil monetary penalty. (i) A civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in the EAA may be imposed for each violation, and in the event that any provision of the EAR is continued by IEEPA or any other authority, the maximum monetary civil penalty for each violation shall be that provided by such other authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in the EAA may be imposed for each violation, and in the event that any provision of the EAR is continued by IEEPA or any other authority, the maximum monetary civil penalty for each violation shall be that provided by such other authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payment of any civil penalty may be made a condition, for a period not exceeding one year after the imposition of such penalty, to the granting, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license, License Exception, permission, or privilege granted or to be granted to the person upon whom such penalty is imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The payment of any civil penalty may be deferred or suspended in whole or in part during any probation period that may be imposed. Such deferral or suspension shall not bar the collection of the penalty if the conditions of the deferral, suspension, or probation are not fulfilled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Denial of export privileges. An order may be issued that restricts the ability of the named persons to engage in export and reexport transactions involving items subject to the EAR, or that restricts access by named persons to items subject to the EAR. An order denying export privileges may be imposed either as a sanction for a violation specified in this part or as a protective administrative measure described in Sec. 764.6(c) or (d) of this part.

An order denying export privileges may suspend or revoke any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to a person named in the denial order or in which such person has an interest, may deny or restrict exports and reexports by or to such person of any item subject to the EAR, and may restrict dealings in which that person may benefit from any export or reexport of such items. The standard terms of a denial order are set forth in Supplement No. 1 to this part. A non-standard denial order, narrower in scope, may be issued. Authorization to engage in actions otherwise prohibited by a denial order may be given by the Office of Exporter Services after consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement upon a written request by a person named in the denial order or by a person seeking permission to deal with a named person. Submit such requests to: Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Exporter Services, Room 2099B, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion from practice.

Conduct that constitutes a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, or that occurs in connection with such a violation, may also be prosecuted under other provisions of law, including 18 U.S.C. 371 (conspiracy), 18 U.S.C. 1001 (false statements), 18 U.S.C. 1341, 1343, and 1346 (mail and wire fraud), and 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 (money laundering).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other sanctions.
