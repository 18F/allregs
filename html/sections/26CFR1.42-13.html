                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Publication of guidance. Under section 42(n), the Secretary has  authority to prescribe regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to  carry out the purposes of section 42. The Secretary may also provide  guidance through various publications in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.  (See Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correcting administrative errors and omissions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  An Agency may correct an administrative error or omission with respect  to allocations and recordkeeping, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section, within a reasonable period after the Agency discovers the  administrative error or omission. Whether a correction is made within a  reasonable period depends on the facts and circumstances of each  situation. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section,  an Agency need not obtain the prior approval of the Secretary to correct  an administrative error or omission, if the correction is made in  accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The administrative  errors and omissions to which this paragraph (b) applies are strictly  limited to those described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and,  thus, do not include, for example, any misinterpretation of the  applicable rules and regulations under section 42. Accordingly, an  Agency's allocation of a particular calendar year's low-income housing  credit dollar amount made after the close of that calendar year, or the  use of an incorrect population amount in calculating a State's housing  credit ceiling for a calendar year are not administrative errors that  can be corrected under this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  include the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A mathematical error;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An entry on a document that is inconsistent with another entry  on the same or another document regarding the same property, or  taxpayer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A failure in tracking the housing credit dollar amount an  Agency has allocated (or that remains to be allocated) in the current  calendar year (e.g., a failure to include in its State housing credit  ceiling a previously allocated credit dollar amount that has been  returned by a taxpayer);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An omission of information that is required on a document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other type of error or omission identified by guidance  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec.   601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) as an administrative error or  omission covered by this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for correcting administrative errors or omissions-- </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. An Agency's correction of an administrative error or  omission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, must amend  the document so that the corrected document reflects the original intent  of the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, and complies  with applicable rules and regulations under section 42.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specific procedures. If a document corrects a document  containing an administrative error or omission that has not yet been  filed with the Internal Revenue Service, the Agency, or the Agency and  the affected taxpayer, should complete and file the corrected document  as the original. When a document containing an administrative error or  omission has already been filed with the Service, the Agency, or the  Agency and the affected taxpayer, should refile a copy of the document  containing the administrative error or omission, and prominently and  clearly note the correction thereon or on an attached new document. The  Agency should indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction  is being made under Sec.  1.42-13 of the Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Secretary's prior approval required. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section, an Agency must obtain the  Secretary's prior approval to correct an administrative error or  omission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the  correction is not made before the close of the calendar year of the  error or omission and the correction--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is a numerical change to the housing credit dollar amount  allocated for the building or project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Affects the determination of any component of the State's  housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Affects the State's unused housing credit carryover that is  assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>. For further information on the application procedure see  Rev. Proc. 93-1, 1993-1 I.R.B. 10 (or any subsequent applicable revenue  procedure). (See Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.) The  application requesting the Secretary's approval must contain the  following information--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name, address, and identification number of each affected  taxpayer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Building Identification Number (B.I.N.) and address of each  building or project affected by the administrative error or omission;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A statement explaining the administrative error or omission and  the intent of the Agency, or of the Agency and the affected taxpayer,  when the document was originally completed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Copies of any supporting documentation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of  the administrative error or omission would have on the housing credit  dollar amount allocated for any building or project; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of  the administrative error or omission would have on the determination of  the components of the State's housing credit ceiling under section  42(h)(3)(C) or on the State's unused housing credit carryover that is  assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Agreement to conditions. To obtain the Secretary's approval  under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency, or the Agency  and the affected taxpayer, must agree to the conditions the Secretary  considers appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Secretary's automatic approval. The Secretary grants automatic  approval to correct an administrative error or omission described in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The correction is not made before the close of the calendar year  of the error or omission and the correction is a numerical change to the  housing   credit dollar amount allocated for the building or multiple-building  project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The administrative error or omission resulted in an allocation  document (the Form 8609, ``Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation  Certification,'' or the allocation document under the requirements of  section 42(h)(1)(E) or (F), and Sec.  1.42-6(d)(2)) that either did not  accurately reflect the number of buildings in a project (for example, an  allocation document for a 10-building project only references 8  buildings instead of 10 buildings), or the correct information (other  than the amount of credit allocated on the allocation document);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The administrative error or omission does not affect the  Agency's ranking of the building(s) or project and the total amount of  credit the Agency allocated to the building(s) or project; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The Agency corrects the administrative error or omission by  following the procedures described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> How Agency corrects errors or omissions subject to automatic  approval. An Agency corrects an administrative error or omission  described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section by--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Amending the allocation document described in paragraph  (b)(3)(vi)(B) of this section to correct the administrative error or  omission. The Agency will indicate on the amended allocation document  that it is making the ``correction under Sec.  1.42-13(b)(3)(vii).'' If  correcting the allocation document requires including any additional  B.I.N.(s) in the document, the document must include any B.I.N.(s)  already existing for buildings in the project. If possible, the  additional B.I.N.(s) should be sequentially numbered from the existing  B.I.N.(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Amending, if applicable, the Schedule A (Form 8610), ``Carryover  Allocation of the Low-Income Housing Credit,'' and attaching a copy of  this schedule to Form 8610, ``Annual Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies  Report,'' for the year the correction is made. The Agency will indicate  on the schedule that it is making the ``correction under Sec.  1.42- 13(b)(3)(vii).'' For a carryover allocation made before January 1, 2000,  the Agency must complete Schedule A (Form 8610), and indicate on the  schedule that it is making the ``correction under Sec.  1.42- 13(b)(3)(vii)'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Amending, if applicable, the Form 8609 and attaching the  original of this amended form to Form 8610 for the year the correction  is made. The Agency will indicate on the Form 8609 that it is making the  ``correction under Sec.  1.42-13(b)(3)(vii)''; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Mailing or otherwise delivering a copy of any amended allocation  document and any amended Form 8609 to the affected taxpayer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Other approval procedures. The Secretary may grant automatic  approval to correct other administrative errors or omissions as  designated in one or more documents published either in the Federal  Register or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) of  this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the scope of this  section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Individual B applied to Agency X for a reservation of a  low-income housing credit dollar amount for a building that is part of a  low-income housing project. When applying for the low-income housing  credit dollar amount, B informed Agency X that B intended to form  Partnership Y to finance the project. After receiving the reservation  letter and prior to receiving an allocation, B formed Partnership Y and  sold partnership interests to a number of limited partners. B  contributed the low-income housing project to Partnership Y in exchange  for a partnership interest. B and Partnership Y informed Agency X of the  ownership change. When actually allocating the housing credit dollar  amount, Agency X sent Partnership Y a document listing B, rather than  Partnership Y, as the building's owner. Partnership Y promptly notified  Agency X of the error. After reviewing related documents, Agency X  determined that it had incorrectly listed B as the building's owner on  the allocation document. Since the parties originally intended that  Partnership Y would receive the allocation as the owner of the building,  Agency X may correct the error without obtaining the Secretary's  approval, and insert Partnership Y as the building's owner on the  allocation document.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Agency Y allocated a lower low-income housing credit  dollar amount for a low-income housing building than Agency Y originally  intended. After the close of the calendar year of the allocation, B, the  building's owner, discovered the error and promptly notified Agency Y.  Agency Y reviewed relevant documents and agreed that an error had  occurred. Agency Y and B must apply, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)  of   this section, for the Secretary's approval before Agency Y may correct  the error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section is effective February 24, 1994.  However, an Agency may elect to apply these regulations to  administrative errors or omissions that occurred before the publication  of these regulations. Any reasonable method used by a State or local  housing credit agency to correct an administrative error or omission  prior to February 24, 1994, will be considered proper, provided that the  method is consistent with the rules of section 42. Paragraphs  (b)(3)(vi), (vii), and (viii) of this section are effective January 14,  2000.  [T.D. 8521, 59 FR 8861, Feb. 24, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8859, 65 FR  2328, Jan. 14, 2000]</p>
