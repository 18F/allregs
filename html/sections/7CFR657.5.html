                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prime farmlands--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Prime farmland is land that has  the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for  producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also  available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland,  rangeland, forest land, or other land, but not urban built-up land or  water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply  needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when  treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable  farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and  dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable  temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity,  acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are  permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible  or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do  not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils  that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent  slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0  to 5 percent slopes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific criteria. Prime farmlands meet all the following  criteria: Terms used in this section are defined in USDA publications:  ``Soil Taxonomy, Agriculture Handbook 436''; ``Soil Survey Manual,  Agriculture Handbook 18''; ``Rainfall-erosion Losses From Cropland,  Agriculture Handbook 282''; ``Wind Erosion Forces in the United States  and Their Use in Predicting Soil Loss, Agriculture Handbook 346''; and  ``Saline and Alkali Soils, Agriculture Handbook 60.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The soils have:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Aquic, udic, ustic, or xeric moisture regimes and sufficient  available water capacity within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter), or in  the root zone (root zone is the part of the soil that is penetrated or  can be penetrated by plant roots) if the root zone is less than 40  inches deep, to produce the commonly grown cultivated crops (cultivated  crops include, but are not limited to, grain, forage, fiber, oilseed,  sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush  fruit crops) adapted to the region in 7 or more years out of 10; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Xeric or ustic moisture regimes in which the available water  capacity is limited, but the area has a developed irrigation water  supply that is dependable (a dependable water supply is one in which  enough water is available for irrigation in 8 out of 10 years for the  crops commonly grown) and of adequate quality; or,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Aridic or torric moisture regimes and the area has a developed  irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The soils have a temperature regime that is frigid, mesic,  thermic, or hyperthermic (pergelic and cryic regimes are excluded).  These are soils that, at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm), have a mean  annual temperature higher than 32 [deg]F (0 [deg]C). In addition, the  mean summer temperature at this depth in soils with an O horizon is  higher than 47 [deg]F (8 [deg]C); in soils that have no O horizon, the  mean summer   temperature is higher than 59 [deg]F (15 [deg]C); and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The soils have a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in all horizons within  a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is  less than 40 inches deep; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The soils either have no water table or have a water table that  is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow  cultivated crops common to the area to be grown; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The soils can be managed so that, in all horizons within a depth  of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is less than  40 inches deep, during part of each year the conductivity of the  saturation extract is less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium  percentage (ESP) is less than 15; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season  (less often than once in 2 years); and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The product of K (erodibility factor) x percent slope is less  than 2.0, and the product of I (soils erodibility) x C (climatic factor)  does not exceed 60; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch  (0.15 cm) per hour in the upper 20 inches (50 cm) and the mean annual  soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm) is less than 59 [deg]F  (15 [deg]C); the permeability rate is not a limiting factor if the mean  annual soil temperature is 59 [deg]F (15 [deg]C) or higher; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in  these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches (7.6 cm).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unique farmland--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Unique farmland is land other than  prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value  food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality,  location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically  produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop  when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods.  Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries,  fruit, and vegetables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific characteristics of unique farmland. (i) Is used for a  specific high-value food or fiber crop; (ii) Has a moisture supply that  is adequate for the specific crop; the supply is from stored moisture,  precipitation, or a developed-irrigation system; (iii) Combines  favorable factors of soil quality, growing season, temperature,  humidity, air drainage, elevation, aspect, or other conditions, such a  nearness to market, that favor the growth of a specific food or fiber  crop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional farmland of statewide importance. This is land, in  addition to prime and unique farmlands, that is of statewide importance  for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oil seed crops.  Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by  the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional  farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime  farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated  and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as  high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some  States, additonal farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts  of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional farmland of local importance. In some local areas  there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of  food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops, even though these lands  are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where  appropriate, these lands are to be identified by the local agency or  agencies concerned. In places, additional farmlands of local importance  may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by  local ordinance.</p>
