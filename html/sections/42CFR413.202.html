                                Sec. 413.202  Organ procurement organization (OPO) cost for kidneys 
Medicare beneficiaries.

                            <p class="depth0">An OPO's total costs for all kidneys is reduced by the costs associated with procuring kidneys sent to foreign transplant centers or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries. OPOs, as defined in Sec. 486.302 of this chapter, must separate costs for procuring kidneys that are sent to foreign transplant centers and kidneys transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries from Medicare allowable costs prior to final settlement by the Medicare fiscal contractors. Medicare costs are based on the ratio of the number of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable costs. Certain long-standing arrangements that existed before March 3, 1988 (for example, an OPO that procures kidneys at a military transplant hospital for transplant at that hospital), will be deemed to be Medicare kidneys for cost reporting statistical purposes. The OPO must submit a request to the contractor for review and approval of these arrangements.
