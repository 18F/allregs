                                Sec. 635.7  At-sea observer coverage.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. NMFS may select for at-sea observer coverage any  vessel that has an Atlantic HMS, tunas, shark or swordfish permit issued  under Sec. 635.4 or Sec. 635.32. Vessels permitted in the HMS Charter/ Headboat and Angling categories will be requested to take observers on a  voluntary basis. When selected, vessels issued any other permit under  Sec. 635.4 or Sec. 635.32 are required to take observers on a mandatory  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selection of vessels. NMFS will notify a vessel owner, in  writing, when his or her vessel is selected for observer coverage.  Vessels will be selected to provide information on catch, bycatch and  other fishery data according to the need for representative samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of trips. The owner or operator of a vessel that is  selected under paragraph (b) of this section must notify NMFS, at an  address designated by NMFS, before commencing any fishing trip that may  result in the incidental catch or harvest of Atlantic HMS. Notification  procedures and information requirements such as expected gear  deployment, trip duration and fishing area will be specified in a  selection letter sent by NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of observers. Once notified of a trip, NMFS will  assign an observer for that trip based on current information needs  relative to the expected catch and bycatch likely to be associated with  the indicated gear deployment, trip duration and fishing area. If an  observer is not assigned for a fishing trip, NMFS will issue a waiver  for that trip to the owner or operator of the selected vessel, so long  as the waiver is consistent with other applicable laws. If an observer  is assigned for a trip, the operator of the selected vessel must arrange  to embark the observer and shall not fish for or retain any Atlantic HMS  unless the NMFS-assigned observer is aboard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements. The owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS- approved observer is embarked, regardless of whether required to carry  the observer, must comply with Secs. 600.725 and 600.746 of this chapter  and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those  provided to the crew.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's  communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission  and receipt of messages related to the observer's duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation  equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allow the observer free and unobstructed access to the vessel's  bridge, working decks, holding bins, weight scales, holds, and any other  space used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allow the observer to inspect and copy the vessel's log,  communications logs, and any records associated with the catch and  distribution of fish for that trip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vessel responsibilities. An owner or operator of a vessel  required to carry one or more observer(s) must provide reasonable  assistance to enable observer(s) to carry out their duties, including,  but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measuring decks, codends, and holding bins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing the observer(s) with a safe work area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Collecting bycatch when requested by the observer(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by the  observer(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allowing the observer(s) to collect biological data and samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Providing adequate space for storage of biological samples.
