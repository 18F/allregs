                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lands withdrawn or reserved from the public domain, together  with Government-owned improvements, which have been determined to be  excess to the department, after screening with other DOD agencies and  the U.S. Coast Guard in accordance with Sec. Sec. 644.333 through  644.339, will be processed for disposal in accordance with 43 CFR 2370- 2374 and Sec. 644.381 of this part. The DE will file a Notice of  Intention to Relinquish as provided by 43 CFR 2372.1. The notice will be  filed in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Land Office having  jurisdiction.  Excess buildings and improvements on the property should be left in  place and no disposal action taken thereon pending further instructions  from BLM, unless it is determined that they should be abandoned in  accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 644.472 through  644.500. A copy of the Notice of Intention to Relinquish submitted to  the appropriate BLM Land Office will be transmitted to HQDA (DAEN-REM)  Washington, DC 20314 and to the appropriate GSA regional office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any restoration, or other work, is proposed to be performed  on the land, the matter will be forwarded to DAEN-REM for prior  approval. Where the DE recommends disposition of the land by GSA as  excess property rather than return to the public domain, no restoration  of the property will be proposed (see 43 CFR 2372.1). Generally, lands  which are unimproved, or contain only minor improvements, will be  recommended for return to the public domain. Exception to this procedure  should be made where development surrounding, or in the vicinity of the  land, has changed its character, although the land itself has not been  improved. Another exception would be the situation described in Sec.  644.350(d). Generally lands which are extensively improved will be  recommended to BLM for disposal as excess property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the authorized officer of BLM determines, pursuant to 43 CFR  2372.3, that the conditions prescribed by that regulation have been met  and that the land is suitable for return to the public domain, he will  notify the DE, as the representative of the holding agency, that the  Department of the Interior accepts accountability and responsibility for  the property. A copy of this notification will be furnished to HQDA  (DAEN-REP) Washington, DC 20314.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the authorized officer of BLM determines, pursuant to 43 CFR  2374.1, that the land is not suitable for return to the public domain  because it is substantially changed in character, and GSA concurs in  this determination, he will notify the DE to report the land and  improvements, with or without minerals, to GSA as excess property. Upon  receipt of this notice, the DE will advise DAEN-REP and report the  property to GSA on SF 118, Report of Excess Real Property, including the  information on claims and encumbrances furnished by BLM under 43 CFR  2374.1 (c). The holding agency has the same responsibility for care,  custody, and accountability of excess public domain as for other  property reported to GSA for disposal.</p>
