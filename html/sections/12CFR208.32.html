For the purposes of this paragraph (b), final disciplinary  action means the imposition of any disciplinary sanction pursuant to  section 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act, or other action of a registered  clearing agency which, after notice and opportunity for hearing, results  in final disposition of charges of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One or more violations of the rules of the registered clearing  agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acts or practices constituting a statutory disqualification of  a type defined in paragraph (iv) or (v) (except prior convictions) of  section 3(a)(39) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, if a registered clearing agency fee schedule specifies  certain charges for errors made by its participants in giving  instructions to the registered clearing agency which are de minimis on a  per error basis, and whose purpose is, in part, to provide revenues to  the clearing agency to compensate it for effort expended in beginning to  process an erroneous instruction, such error charges shall not be  considered a final disciplinary action for purposes of this paragraph  (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of final disciplinary action notice.

Any registered clearing agency for which the Board is  the appropriate regulatory agency that takes any final action shall  promptly file notice thereof with the Board (and the appropriate  regulatory agency, if other than the Board, for the affected person) in  accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, where the final action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Denies or conditions participation to any person, or prohibits  or limits access to services offered by the clearing agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is based upon a statutory disqualification of a type defined in  paragraph (A), (B) or (C) of section 3(a)(39) of the Act, consisting of  a prior conviction, as described in subparagraph (E) of section 3(a)(39)  of the Act. However, no such action shall be considered final pursuant  to this paragraph (f) that results merely from a notice of such  disqualification to the person affected, if such person has not sought  an adjudication of the matter, including a hearing, or otherwise  exhausted the administrative remedies within the clearing agency with  respect to such a matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contents of notice required by paragraph (f) of this section.

Any notice pursuant to  paragraph (h) of this section shall contain at least the following  information, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the participant concerned and the participant's last  known address, as reflected in the records of the clearing agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date upon which the summary action became or will become  effective;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the summary action is based upon the provisions of section  17A(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, a copy of the relevant order or decision of  the self-regulatory organization, if available to the clearing agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the summary action is based upon the provisions of section  17A(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, a statement describing the default of any  delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(C)(iii)</em> of the Act, a statement describing the financial or  operating difficulty of the participant based upon which the clearing  agency determined that the suspension and closing of accounts was  necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants,  creditors, or investors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The nature and effective date of the suspension; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Such other matters as the clearing agency deems relevant.</p>
