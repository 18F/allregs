                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the public solicitation requirements of this part, the Director may award a concession contract non-competitively to any qualified person if the Director determines both that such an award is otherwise consistent with the requirements of this part and that extraordinary circumstances exist under which compelling and equitable considerations require the award of the concession contract to a particular qualified person in the public interest. Indisputable equitable considerations must be the determinant of such circumstances. The Director must publish a notice of his intention to award a concession contract to a specified person under these circumstances and the reasons for the proposed award in the Federal Register at least 60 days before the concession contract is awarded. In addition, the Director also must notify the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives at least 60 days before the contract is awarded. The Director must personally approve any such award and may only do so with the prior written approval of the Secretary.</p>
