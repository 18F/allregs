The closed container may contain a device that allows  pressure relief, but does not allow liquid solvent to drain from the  container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a flexible hose or flushing device is used, flushing shall be  performed only within the freeboard area of the solvent cleaning  machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall drain solvent cleaned parts for 15  seconds or until dripping has stopped, whichever is longer. Parts having  cavities or blind holes shall be tipped or rotated while draining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall ensure that the solvent level does  not exceed the fill line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spills during solvent transfer shall be wiped up immediately.

The owner or operator must  demonstrate to the Administrator (or delegated State, local, or Tribal  authority) that the alternative measures will result in equivalent or  better emissions control compared to the measures described in  paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section. For example, storing  solvent and solvent-laden materials in an enclosed area that is  ventilated to a solvent recovery or destruction device may be considered  an acceptable alternative.
