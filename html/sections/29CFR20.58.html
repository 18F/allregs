                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current  value of funds to the United States Treasury as published in the Federal  Register (as of the date the notice is sent), unless another rate is  specified by statute, regulations or preexisting contract condition. The  Office of the Chief Financial Officer will notify agencies promptly of  the current Treasury rate. The responsible agency may assess a higher  rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is  necessary to protect the interests of the United States, and such rate  is agreed to by the Chief Financial Officer (or his designee). The rate  of interest prescribed in section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code  shall be sought for backwages recovered in litigation by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed  for the duration of the indebtedness, except that where a debtor has  defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new  agreement, the agency may set a new interest rate which reflects the  current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is  executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest shall not be assessed on interest, penalties or  administrative costs required by this subpart. However, if the debtor  defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges which accrued but  were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the  principal to be paid under a new repayment agreement.</p>
