                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The cost to acquire a tangible capital asset includes the  purchase price of the asset and costs necessary to prepare the asset for  use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purchase price of an asset shall be adjusted to the extent  practical by premiums and extra charges paid or discounts and credits  received which properly reflect an adjustment in the purchase price.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Purchase price is the consideration given in exchange for an  asset and is determined by cash paid, or to the extent payment is not  made in cash, in an amount equivalent to what would be the cash price  basis. Where this amount is not available, the purchase price is  determined by the current value of the consideration given in exchange  for the asset. For example, current value for a credit instrument is the  amount immediately required to settle the obligation or the amount of  money which might have been raised   directly through the use of the same instrument employed in making the  credit purchase. The current value of an equity security is its market  value. Market value is the current or prevailing price of the security  as indicated by recent market quotations. If such values are unavailable  or not appropriate (thin market, volatile price movement, etc.), an  acceptable alternative is the fair value of the asset acquired.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Donated assets which, at the time of receipt, meet the  contractor's criteria for capitalization shall be capitalized at their  fair value at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs necessary to prepare the asset for use include the cost of  placing the asset in location and bringing the asset to a condition  necessary for normal or expected use. Where material in amount, such  costs, including initial inspection and testing, installation and  similar expenses, shall be capitalized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tangible capital assets constructed or fabricated by a  contractor for its own use shall be capitalized at amounts which include  all indirect costs properly allocable to such assets. This requires the  capitalization of general and administrative expenses when such expenses  are identifiable with the constructed asset and are material in amount  (e.g., when the in-house construction effort requires planning,  supervisory, or other significant effort by officers or other personnel  whose salaries are regularly charged to general and administrative  expenses). When the constructed assets are identical with or similar to  the contractor's regular product, such assets shall be capitalized at  amounts which include a full share of indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In circumstances where the acquisition by purchase or donation  of previously used tangible capital assets is not an arm's length  transaction, acquisition cost shall be limited to the capitalized cost  of the asset to the owner who last acquired the asset through an arm's- length transaction, reduced by depreciation charges from date of that  acquisition to date of gift or sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The capitalized values of tangible capital assets acquired in a  business combination, accounted for under the ``purchase method'' of  accounting, shall be assigned to these assets as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All the tangible capital assets of the acquired company that  during the most recent cost accounting period prior to a business  combination generated either depreciation expense or cost of money  charges that were allocated to Federal government contracts or  subcontracts negotiated on the basis of cost, shall be capitalized by  the buyer at the net book value(s) of the asset(s) as reported by the  seller at the time of the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All the tangible capital asset(s) of the acquired company that  during the most recent cost accounting period prior to a business  combination did not generate either depreciation expense or cost of  money charges that were allocated to Federal government contracts or  subcontracts negotiated on the basis of cost, shall be assigned a  portion of the cost of the acquired company not to exceed their fair  value(s) at the date of acquisition. When the fair value of identifiable  acquired assets less liabilities assumed exceeds the purchase price of  the acquired company in an acquisition under the ``purchase method,''  the value otherwise assignable to tangible capital assets shall be  reduced by a proportionate part of the excess.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under the ``pooling of interest method'' of accounting for  business combinations, the values established for tangible captial  assets for financial accounting shall be the values used for determining  the cost of such assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Asset accountability units shall be identified and separately  capitalized at the time the assets are acquired. However, whether or not  the contractor identifies and separately capitalizes a unit initially,  the contractor shall remove the unit from the asset accounts when it is  disposed of and, if replaced, its replacement shall be capitalized.
