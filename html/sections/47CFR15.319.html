                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All transmissions must use only digital modulation techniques.  Both asynchronous and isochronous operations are permitted within the  1920-1930 MHz band.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Peak transmit power shall not exceed 100 microwatts multiplied  by the square root of the emission bandwidth in hertz. Peak transmit  power must be measured over any interval of continuous transmission  using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an rms-equivalent voltage.  The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument  limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution  bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth,  sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the  emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Power spectral density shall not exceed 3 milliwatts in any 3  kHz bandwidth as measured with a spectrum analyzer having a resolution  bandwidth of 3 kHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The peak transmit power shall be reduced by the amount in  decibels that the maximum directional gain of the antenna exceeds 3 dBi.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The device shall automatically discontinue transmission in case  of either absence of information to transmit or operational failure. The  provisions in this section are not intended to preclude transmission of  control and signaling information or use of repetitive codes used by  certain digital technologies to complete frame or burst intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notwithstanding other technical requirements specified in this  subpart, attenuation of emissions below the general emission limits in  Sec. 15.209 is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where there is a transition between limits, the tighter limit  shall apply at the transition point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Unlicensed PCS devices are subject to the radiofrequency  radiation exposure requirements specified in Secs. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and  2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. All equipment shall be  considered to operate in a ``general population/uncontrolled''  environment. Applications for equipment authorization of devices  operating under this section must contain a   statement confirming compliance with these requirements for both  fundamental emissions and unwanted emissions. Technical information  showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to the Commission  upon request.
