                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart establish procedures consistent with  section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). This  subpart establishes procedures for the approval of State rules,  programs, or other requirements such as permit terms and conditions to  be implemented and enforced in place of certain otherwise applicable  section 112 Federal rules, emission standards, or requirements  (including section 112 rules promulgated under the authority of the Act  prior to the 1990 Amendments to the Act). The authority to implement and  enforce section 112 Federal rules as promulgated without changes may be  delegated under procedures established in this subpart. In this process,  States may seek approval of a State mechanism for receiving delegation  of existing and future unchanged Federal section 112 standards. This  subpart clarifies which part 63, subpart A General Provisions  authorities can be delegated to States. This subpart also establishes  procedures for the review and withdrawal of section 112 implementation  and enforcement authorities delegated through this subpart. This subpart  also establishes procedures for the approval of State rules or programs  to establish limitations on the potential to emit pollutants listed in  or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative requirements means the requirements, rules, permits,  provisions, methods, or other enforceable mechanisms that a State  submits for approval under this subpart or subpart A and, after  approval, replaces the otherwise applicable Federal section 112  requirements, provisions, or methods.</p><p class="depth0">Applicability criteria means the regulatory criteria used to define  all affected sources subject to a specific section 112 rule.</p><p class="depth0">Approval means a determination by the Administrator that a State  rule, program, or requirement meets the criteria of Sec. 63.91 and the  additional criteria of either Sec. 63.92, Sec. 63.93, Sec. 63.94, or  Sec. 63.97 as appropriate. For accidental release prevention programs,  the criteria of Sec. 63.95 must be met in addition to the criteria of  Sec. 63.91. This is considered a ``full approval'' for the purposes of  this subpart. Partial approvals may also be granted as described in this  subpart. Any approved requirements become applicable requirements under  Sec. 70.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance and enforcement measures means requirements relating to  compliance and enforcement, including but not necessarily limited to  monitoring methods and procedures, recordkeeping, reporting, plans,  inspection, maintenance, and operation requirements, pollution  prevention requirements, noticing, field inspections, entry, sampling,  or accidental release prevention oversight.</p><p class="depth0">Intermediate change to monitoring means a modification to federally  required monitoring involving ``proven technology'' (generally accepted  by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on  a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the  stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though  site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a  source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally  required monitoring. Examples of intermediate changes to monitoring  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) in lieu of  a parameter monitoring approach;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Decreased frequency for non-continuous parameter monitoring or  physical inspections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes to quality control requirements for parameter  monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of an electronic data reduction system in lieu of manual  data reduction.</p><p class="depth0">Intermediate change to test method means a within-method  modification to a federally enforceable test method involving ``proven  technology'' (generally accepted by the scientific community as  equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that   may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated  emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate  change may set a national precedent for a source category and may  ultimately result in a revision to the federally enforceable test  method. In order to be approved, an intermediate change must be  validated according to EPA Method 301 (Part 63, Appendix A) to  demonstrate that it provides equal or improved accuracy and precision.  Examples of intermediate changes to a test method include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Modifications to a test method's sampling procedure including  substitution of sampling equipment that has been demonstrated for a  particular sample matrix, and use of a different impinger absorbing  solution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changes in sample recovery procedures and analytical techniques,  such as changes to sample holding times and use of a different  analytical finish with proven capability for the analyte of interest;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Combining'' a federally required method with another proven  method for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">Level of control means the degree to which a rule, program, or  requirement limits emissions or employs design, equipment, work  practice, or operational standards, accident prevention, or other  requirements or techniques (including a prohibition of emissions) for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each hazardous air pollutant, if individual pollutants are  subject to emission limitations, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate total of hazardous air pollutants, if the  aggregate grouping is subject to emission limitations, provided that the  rule, program, or requirement would not lead to an increase in risk to  human health or the environment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each substance regulated under part 68 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test methods and associated procedures and averaging times are  integral to the level of control.</p><p class="depth0">Local agency means a local air pollution control agency or, for the  purposes of Sec. 63.95, any local agency or entity having responsibility  for preventing accidental releases which may occur at a source regulated  under part 68 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Major change to monitoring means a modification to federally  required monitoring that uses ``unproven technology or procedures'' (not  generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new  method (sometimes necessary when the required monitoring is unsuitable).  A major change to monitoring may be site-specific or may apply to one or  more source categories and will almost always set a national precedent.  Examples of major changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of a new monitoring approach developed to apply to a control  technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) in place  of a required continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of alternative calibration procedures that do not involve  calibration gases or test cells;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of an analytical technology that differs from that specified  by a performance specification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Decreased monitoring frequency for a continuous emission  monitoring system, continuous opacity monitoring system, predictive  emission monitoring system, or continuous parameter monitoring system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Decreased monitoring frequency for a leak detection and repair  program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Use of alternative averaging times for reporting purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Major change to recordkeeping/reporting means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> May decrease the stringency of the required compliance and  enforcement measures for the relevant standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May have national significance (e.g., might affect  implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources,  might set a national precedent); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is not site-specific.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples of major changes to recordkeeping and reporting  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Decreases in the record retention for all records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver of all or most recordkeeping or reporting requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Major changes to the contents of reports; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Decreases in the reliability of recordkeeping or reporting  (e.g., manual recording of monitoring data instead of required automated  or electronic recording, or paper reports where electronic reporting may  have been required).</p><p class="depth0">Major change to test method means a modification to a federally  enforceable test method that uses ``unproven technology or procedures''  (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely  new method (sometimes necessary when the required test method is  unsuitable). A major change to a test method may be site-specific, or  may apply to one or more sources or source categories, and will almost  always set a national precedent. In order to be approved, a major change  must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (part 63, appendix A).  Examples of major changes to a test method include, but are not limited  to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of an unproven analytical finish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of a method developed to fill a test method gap;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of a new test method developed to apply to a control  technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combining two or more sampling/analytical methods (at least one  unproven) into one for application to processes emitting multiple  pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">Minor change to monitoring means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A modification to federally required monitoring that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and  enforcement measures for the relevant standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect  implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources,  does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a  revision to the monitoring requirements); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the  operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of  an affected source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples of minor changes to monitoring include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Modifications to a sampling procedure, such as use of an  improved sample conditioning system to reduce maintenance requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Increased monitoring frequency; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Modification of the environmental shelter to moderate  temperature fluctuation and thus protect the analytical instrumentation.</p><p class="depth0">Minor change to recordkeeping/reporting means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and  enforcement measures for the relevant standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect  implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources,  does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a  revision to the recordkeeping or reporting requirement);

and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in recovery and analytical techniques such as a change  in quality control/quality assurance requirements needed to adjust for  analysis of a certain sample matrix.</p><p class="depth0">Partial approval means that the Administrator approves under this  subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A State's legal authorities that fully meet the criteria of  Sec. 63.91(d)(3)(ii)-(v), and substantially meet the criteria of  Sec. 63.91(d)(3)(i) as appropriate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State rule or program that meets the criteria of Sec. 63.92,  Sec. 63.93, Sec. 63.94, Sec. 63.95, or Sec. 63.97 with the exception of  a separable portion of that State rule or program which fails to meet  those criteria. A separable portion of a State rule or program is  defined as a section(s) of a rule or a portion(s) of a program which can  be acted upon independently without affecting the overall integrity of  the rule or program as a whole.</p><p class="depth0">Program means, for the purposes of an approval under this subpart, a  collection of State authorities, resources, and other requirements that  satisfy the criteria of this subpart and subpart A.</p><p class="depth0">State agency, for the purposes of this subpart, includes State and  local air pollution agencies, Indian tribes as defined in Sec. 71.2 of  this chapter, and territories of the United States to the extent they  are or will be delegated Federal section 112 rules, emission standards,  or requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Stringent or stringency means the degree of rigor, strictness or  severity a statute, rule, emission standard, or requirement imposes on  an affected source as measured by the quantity of emissions, or as  measured by parameters relating to rule applicability and level of  control, or as otherwise determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Title V operating permit programs means the part 70 permitting  program and the delegated Indian tribal programs under part 70 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Local agency coordination with State and territorial agencies.
