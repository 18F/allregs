                            <p class="depth0">As indicated in Sec. 784.138, after the character of the aquatic  products as taken from nature has been altered by the performance of the  enumerated operations so as to render them nonperishable (e.g., drying  and cleaning sponges) section 13(b)(4) provides no exemption for any  subsequent operations on the preserved products, unless the subsequent  operation is performed as an integrated part of the operations named in  the exemption which are performed by an employer on aquatic commodities  described in section 13(b)(4)   after receiving them in the perishable state. In the case of an employer  who is engaged in performing on perishable aquatic forms of life  specified in section 13(b)(4) any operations named in that section which  result in a nonperishable product, the employment of his employees in  the storing, marketing, packing for shipment, or distributing of  nonperishable products resulting from such operations performed by him  (including products processed during previous weeks or seasons) will be  considered to be an integrated part of his operations on the perishable  aquatic forms of life during those workweeks when he is actively engaged  in such operations. The employees employed by him in such work on the  nonperishable products are, accordingly, within the exemption in such  workweeks.</p>
