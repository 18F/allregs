boiler to improve thermal efficiency will not affect a unit's classification as a combined cycle unit.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion turbine means a unit that is a rotary engine driven by a gas under pressure that is created by the combustion of any fuel.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial unmarketability as used in the definitions of ``alternate fuel,'' ``natural gas'' and ``petroleum'' shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A waste by-product of industrial or refinery operations is commercially unmarketable by reason of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Quality, where the cost of processing (limited to upgrading the waste by-product to commercial quality), storing, and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Quantity, where the cost of aggregating the waste by-product into commercial quantities through storing and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A fuel will not be classified as ``natural gas'' when it is commercially unmarketable by reason of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Quality, where the cost of producing, upgrading to commercial quality, storing, and distributing the fuel would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Quantity, where the quantities of the fuel are so small that the revenues to be reasonably expected from its sale would not cover the cost of its production, distribution or storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs associated with upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating a by-product or other fuel (to determine if such fuel is natural gas) may properly include a reasonable rate of return on any capital investment required to overcome the problems posed by the quality or quantity of a fuel because the return on investment is a normal aspect of any investment decision. A firm may account for this reasonable rate of return by using its customary discount rate for an investment of similar risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As part of any consideration of the rate of return on investment, the cost of replacing the Btu's lost if the by-product or other fuel were upgraded and sold instead of used as a fuel may be taken into consideration. The actual expense that would result from burning a replacement fuel in lieu of the by-product or other fuel in question may therefore be considered. The costs associated with using a replacement fuel are indirect costs that result from upgrading and selling the fuel, instead of burning it. These indirect costs as well as the direct costs associated with the upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating of by-products or other fuel may be considered in any assessment of commercial unmarketability.</p><p class="depth0">Conference means an informal meeting incident to any proceeding, between DOE and any interested person.</p><p class="depth0">Construction means substantial physical activity at the unit site and includes more than clearance of a site or installation of foundation pilings.</p><p class="depth0">Costs means total costs, both operating and capital, incurred over the estimated remaining useful life of an electric powerplant, discounted to the present, pursuant to rules established in parts 503 and 504 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">DEOA means the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub.
