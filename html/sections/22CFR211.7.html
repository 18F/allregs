                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Costs at discharge ports. Except as otherwise agreed upon by  AID/W and provided in the applicable shipping contract or in paragraph  (d) and (e) of this section, the cooperating sponsor shall be  responsible for all costs, other than those assessed by the delivering  carrier either in accordance with its applicable tariff for delivery to  the discharge port or the applicable charter or booking contract. The  cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for all costs related to</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distributing the commodity to end users, as provided in the  approved Operational Plan or TA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demurrage, detention, and overtime;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtaining independent discharge survey reports as provided in  Sec. 211.9 under which the cooperating sponsor will be reimbursed for  the costs of obtaining independent survey reports as provided in Sec.  211.9(c)(1)(iv); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wharfage, taxes, dues, and port charges assessed and collected  by local authorities from the consignee, lighterage (when not a custom  of the port), and lightening costs when assessed as a charge separate  from the freight rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duty, taxes, and consular invoices. Except for commodities which  are to be monetized (sold) under an approved Operational Plan or TA,  commodities shall be admitted duty free and exempt from all taxes.  Consular or legalization invoices shall not be required unless specific  provision is made in the Operational Plan or TA. If required, they shall  be issued without cost to the cooperating sponsor or to the Government  of the United States. The cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for  ensuring prompt entry and transit in the foreign country(ies) and for  obtaining all necessary import permits, licenses or other appropriate  approvals for entry and transit, including phytosanitary, health and  inspection certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storage facilities and transportation in foreign countries. The  cooperating sponsors shall provide assurance to USAID or the Diplomatic  Post that all necessary arrangements for receiving the commodities have  been made, and shall assume full responsibility for storage and  maintenance of the commodities from time of delivery at port of entry  abroad or, when authorized, at other designated points of entry abroad  agreed upon between the cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. Before  recommending approval of a program to AID/W, USAID or the Diplomatic  Post shall obtain, from the cooperating sponsor, assurance that  provision has been made for internal transportation, and for storage and  handling which are adequate by local commercial standards. The  cooperating sponsor shall be responsible for the maintenance of the  commodities in such manner as to assure distribution of the commodities  in good condition to recipient agencies or eligible recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inland transportation in intermediate countries. In the case of  landlocked countries, transportation in the intermediate country to a  designated inland point of entry in the recipient country shall be  arranged by the cooperating sponsor unless otherwise provided in the  Operational Plan or TA. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall  handle claims arising from loss or damage in the intermediate country,  in accordance with Sec. 211.9(e). Governmental cooperating sponsors  shall assign any rights that they may have to any claims that arise in  the intermediate country to USAID or the Diplomatic Post which shall  pursue and retain the proceeds of such claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authorization for reimbursement of costs. If, because of  packaging damage, a cooperating sponsor determines that commodities must  be repackaged to ensure that the commodities arrive at the distribution  point in a wholesome condition, the cooperating sponsor may incur  expenses for such repackaging up to $500 and such costs will be  reimbursed by CCC. If costs will exceed $500, the authority to repackage  and incur   the costs must be approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post in advance of  repackaging unless such prior approval is specifically waived, in  writing, by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. For losses in transit, the  $500 limitation shall apply to all commodities which are shipped on the  same voyage of the same vessel to the same port of destination,  irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of  different bills of lading issued by the carrier. For other losses, the  $500 limitation shall apply to each loss situation, e.g., if 700 bags  are damaged in a warehouse due to an earthquake, the $500 limitation  applies to the total cost of repackaging the 700 bags. Shipments may not  be artificially divided in order to avoid the limitation of $500 or for  obtaining prior approval to incur repackaging costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Method of reimbursement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Costs of repackaging required  because of damage occurring prior to or during discharge from the ocean  carrier should be included, as a separate item, in claims filed against  the ocean carrier. (See Sec. 211.9(c).) Full reimbursement of such  costs up to $500 will be made by CCC upon receipt of invoices or other  documents to support such costs. For amounts expended in excess of $500,  reimbursement will be made upon receipt of supporting invoices or other  documents establishing the costs of repackaging and showing the prior  approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post to incur the costs, unless  approval is waived under Sec. 211.7(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs of repackaging required because of damage caused after  discharge of the cargo from the ocean carrier will be reimbursed to the  cooperating sponsor by CCC (USDA-ASCS Fiscal Division, 14th &  Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250) upon receipt of supporting  invoices or other documentation.</p>
