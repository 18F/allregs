                            <p class="depth0">Sale contract forms will be prepared by the DE conducting the sale. ENG Form 571-R, Invitation for Bids, Bid and Acceptance, Sale of Surplus Real Property will be used as a guide in sales of bare land or improved land and related personal property. ENG Form

1038-R, Invitation for Bids, Bid and Acceptance, Sale and Removal of Buildings (or other Real Estate Improvements), will be used as a guide in sales of buildings and other improvements for removal from the site. These forms are designed for use in normal sales of land and real estate improvements pursuant to existing delegations of authority. The DE is authorized to change the formats, to rearrange the sequence of paragraphs, and to add or to delete paragraphs in whole or part, as local circumstances require, but no substantive departure from the forms is authorized without prior specific approval of DAEN-REM. Whenever a sale is to be conducted pursuant to a special delegation of authority, and whenever the circumstances of a sale are such as to render use of these forms inappropriate, a form will be devised by the DE to meet the requirements of the particular sale involved, and forwarded to DAEN-REM for approval. Suggested additional provisions and conditions for use in the sale of standing timber are contained in ENG Form 2140-R, Supplement to Standard Form 114 for use in Timber Sales Contract. In preparing sale contract forms, the following instructions will be followed:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A definite date and time will be set for the opening of bids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bids will be prepared in quadruplicate, all copies to be signed by the bidder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Invitation for Bids will require each bidder to submit with his bid a certified check, cashier's check, traveler's check, or United States postal money order drawn to the order of the ``Treasurer of the United States'' for at least 20 percent of the bid. When the cash bid may be a small part of the total consideration (where such dismantling and restoration is involved), the DE should set a definite higher amount as a bid deposit. Also, in such cases a performance bond, adequate to discourage breach of contract after only partial performance, may be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For real property components the Invitation for Bids will require payment in full within seven days after the successful bidder is notified that his bid is accepted and, in any event, prior to removal of the property. The time specified for completion of payment for land will depend upon the sum of money involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bids may be submitted for one or any number of items. Items or lots of real property will be offered in such reasonable quantities as to permit all bidders, small as well as large, to compete on equal terms. Land, however, will not be subdivided solely for this purpose, and in the case of timber sales or sales of embedded sand, gravel and stone, it may not be feasible to have more than one purchaser operating in the same area. Further, it may not be to the Government's interest. Buildings will be offered for sale as single items whenever practicable but submission of bids covering specified groups as an item or all of the buildings may be permitted if the DE considers such a procedure is in the best interest of the Government. It may sometimes be advantageous to divide the buildings into appropriate groups and to permit bidding on individual buildings or on specified groups of buildings or on the entire lot. When such bids are permitted, the Invitation for Bids, ENG Form 1038-R, will be flagged to inform bidders that lump sum bids on the entire lot (and specified groupings, if this procedure is appropriate) may be made but will not be accepted unless the lump sum bid exceeds the total of the highest bids received on each item (or on the groupings).</p>
