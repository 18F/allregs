However, additional HTF funds  may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion,  but the amount of HTF funds in the project may not exceed the maximum  per-unit development subsidy amount established pursuant to Sec.  93.300.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay for the acquisition of property owned by the grantee, except  for property acquired by the grantee with HTF funds or property acquired  in anticipation of carrying out an HTF project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pay delinquent taxes, fees, or charges on properties to be  assisted with HTF funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pay for political activities, advocacy, lobbying (whether  directly or through other parties), counseling services (except for  housing counseling), travel expenses (other than those eligible under  Sec. 93.202(b)), or preparing or providing advice on tax returns. The  prohibited use of funds for political activities includes influencing  the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of one or more  candidates to any Federal, State, or local office as codified in section  501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pay for administrative, outreach, or other costs to manage and  operate the grantee of HTF funds, except those administrative costs  necessary to carry out the HTF program in Sec. 93.202, including  housing counseling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pay for any cost that is not eligible under Sec. 93.201 and  Sec. 93.202.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The grantee may not charge (and must prohibit subgrantees and  recipients from charging) servicing, origination, or other fees for the  costs of administering the HTF program. However, the grantee may charge  owners of rental projects reasonable annual fees for monitoring  compliance during the period of affordability. The fees must be based  upon the average actual cost of performing the monitoring of HTF- assisted rental projects. The basis for determining the amount of the  fee must be documented and the fee must be included in the costs of the  project as part of the project underwriting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grantee may also charge nominal application fees (although  these fees are not an eligible HTF cost) to eligible recipients, to  discourage frivolous applications. The amount of application fees must  be appropriate to the type of application and may not create an undue  impediment to an extremely low-income family to be able to participate  in the grantee's program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All fees are applicable credits under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition, the grantee must prohibit project owners from  charging fees that are not customarily charged in rental housing (e.g.,  laundry room access fees), except that rental project owners may charge:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable application fees to prospective tenants;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Parking fees to tenants only if such fees are customary for  rental housing projects in the neighborhood; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fees for services such as bus transportation or meals, as long  as the services are voluntary and fees are charged for services  provided.</p>
