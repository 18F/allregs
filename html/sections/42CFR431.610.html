The plan must provide that, in certifying NFs, HHAs, and ICF-IIDs, the survey agency designated under paragraph (e) of this section will --</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review and evaluate medical and independent professional review team reports obtained under part 456 of this subchapter as they relate to health and safety requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have qualified personnel perform on-site inspections periodically as appropriate based on the timeframes in the correction plan and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least once during each certification period or more frequently if there is a compliance question; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For non-State operated NFs, within the timeframes specified in Sec.  488.308 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have qualified personnel perform on-site inspections--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least once during each certification period or more frequently if there is a compliance question; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For intermediate care facilities with deficiencies as described in Sec. Sec.  442.112 and 442.113 of this subchapter, within 6 months after initial correction plan approval and every 6 months thereafter as required under those sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> FFP for survey responsibilities.
