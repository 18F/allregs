                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assign each engine a unique identification number and  permanently affix, engrave, or stamp it on the engine in a legible way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label  identifying each engine. The label must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attached in one piece so it is not removable without being  destroyed or defaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secured to a part of the engine needed for normal operation and  not normally requiring replacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Durable and readable for the engine's entire life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Written in English.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The label must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include the heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify  another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply  with the provisions of Sec.  1042.640.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family  (and subfamily, where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify all the emission standards that apply to the engine (or  FELs, if applicable). If you do not declare an FEL under subpart H of  this part, you may alternatively state the engine's category,  displacement (in liters or L/cyl), maximum engine power (in kW), and  power density (in kW/L) as needed to determine the emission standards  for the engine family. You may specify displacement, maximum engine  power, or power density as a range consistent with the ranges listed in  Sec.  1042.101. See Sec.  1042.140 for descriptions of how to specify  per-cylinder displacement, maximum engine power, and power density.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR];  however, you may omit this from the label if you stamp, engrave, or  otherwise permanently identify it elsewhere on the engine, in which case  you must also describe in your application for certification where you  will identify the date on the engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identify the application(s) for which the engine family is  certified (such as constant-speed auxiliary, variable-speed propulsion  engines used with fixed-pitch propellers, etc.). If the engine is  certified as a recreational engine, state: ``INSTALLING THIS  RECREATIONAL ENGINE IN A COMMERCIAL VESSEL OR USING THE VESSEL FOR  COMMERCIAL PURPOSES MAY VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY (40  CFR 1042.601).''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For engines requiring ULSD, state: ``ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL  FUEL ONLY''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> State the useful life for your engine family if the applicable  useful life is based on the provisions of Sec.  1042.101(e)(2) or (3),  or Sec.  1042.104(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Identify the emission control system. Use terms and  abbreviations as described in 40 CFR 1068.45. You may omit this  information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you  put it in the owners manual instead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> State: ``THIS MARINE ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS  FOR [MODEL YEAR].''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> For a Category 1 or Category 2 engine that can be modified to  operate on residual fuel, but has not been certified to meet the  standards on such a fuel, include the statement: ``THIS ENGINE IS  CERTIFIED FOR OPERATION ONLY WITH DIESEL FUEL. MODIFYING THE ENGINE TO  OPERATE ON RESIDUAL OR INTERMEDIATE FUEL MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL  LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> For an engine equipped with on-off emissions controls as  allowed by Sec.  1042.115, include the statement: ``THIS ENGINE IS  CERTIFIED WITH ON-OFF EMISSION CONTROLS. OPERATION OF THE ENGINE  CONTRARY TO 40 CFR 1042.115(g) IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO  CIVIL PENALTIES.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> For engines intended for installation on domestic or public  vessels, include the following statement: ``THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY  WITH INTERNATIONAL MARINE REGULATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL VESSELS UNLESS IT  IS ALSO COVERED BY AN EIAPP CERTIFICATE.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may add information to the emission control information  label as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may identify other emission standards that the engine meets  or does not meet (such as international standards). You may include this  information by adding it to the statement we specify or by including a  separate statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may add other information to ensure that the engine will be  properly maintained and used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may add appropriate features to prevent counterfeit labels.  For example, you may include the engine's unique identification number  on the label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For engines requiring ULSD, create a separate label with the  statement: ``ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL ONLY''. Permanently attach  this label to the vessel near the fuel inlet or, if you do not  manufacture the vessel, take one of the following steps to ensure that  the vessel will be properly labeled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the label to each vessel manufacturer and include in the  emission-related installation instructions the requirement to place this  label near the fuel inlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confirm that the vessel manufacturers install their own  complying labels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may ask us to approve modified labeling requirements in this  part 1042 if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will  approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the  intent of the labeling requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you obscure the engine label while installing the engine in  the vessel such that the label will be hard to read during normal  maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the vessel. If others  install your engine in their vessels in a way that obscures the engine  label, we require them to add a duplicate label on the vessel (see 40  CFR 1068.105); in that case, give them the number of duplicate labels  they request and keep the following records for at least five years:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written documentation of the request from the vessel  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of duplicate labels you send for each family and the  date you sent them.
