                                Sec. 783.22  Pay standards for employees subject to ``old'' coverage
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The 1961 amendments did not change the tests described in Sec. 783.18 by which coverage based on the employee's individual activities is determined. Any employee whose employment satisfies these tests and would not have come within some exemption (such as section 13(a)(14)) in the Act prior to the 1961 amendments is subject to the ``old'' provisions of the law and entitled to a minimum wage of at least $1.15 an hour beginning September 3, 1961, and not less than $1.25 an hour beginning September 3, 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)), unless expressly exempted by some provision of the amended Act. Such an employee is also entitled to overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times his regular rate of pay (29 U.S.C. 207(a)(1)), unless expressly exempt from overtime by some exemption such as section 13(b)(6). (Minimum wage rates in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa are governed by special provisions of the Act (26 U.S.C. 206(a)(3); 206(c)(2).) Information on these rates is available at any office of the Wage and Hour Division.</p>
