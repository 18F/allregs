                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory supervisory actions by credit union. A federally- insured credit union which is ``undercapitalized'' must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Earnings retention. Increase net worth and transfer earnings to  its regular reserve account in accordance with Sec. 702.201;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit net worth restoration plan. Submit a net worth  restoration plan pursuant to Sec. 702.206, provided however, that a  credit union in this category having a net worth ratio of less than five  percent (5%) which fails to timely submit such a plan, or which  materially fails to implement an approved plan, is classified  ``significantly undercapitalized'' pursuant to Sec. 702.102(a)(4)(ii)  above;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restrict increase in assets. Beginning the effective date of  classification as ``undercapitalized'' or lower, not permit the credit  union's assets to increase beyond its total assets (per Sec. 702.2(j))  for the preceding quarter unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Plan approved. The NCUA Board has approved a net worth  restoration plan which provides for an increase in total assets and--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The assets of the credit union are increasing consistent with  the approved plan; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The credit union is implementing steps to increase the net worth  ratio consistent with the approved plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Plan not approved. The NCUA Board has not approved a net worth  restoration plan and total assets of the credit union are increasing  because of increases since quarter-end in balances of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total accounts receivable and accrued income on loans and  investments; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Total cash and cash equivalents; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em>  cannot offer rates on shares in excess of prevailing rates on shares in  its relevant market area, and cannot open new branches;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Restrict member business loans. Beginning the effective date of  classification as ``undercapitalized'' or lower, not increase the total  dollar amount of member business loans (defined as loans outstanding and  unused commitments to lend) as of the preceding quarter-end unless it is  granted an exception under 12 U.S.C. 1757a(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Second tier'' discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA.  Subject to the applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and  enforcing directives set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter,  the NCUA Board may, by directive, take one or more of the following  actions with respect to an ``undercapitalized'' credit union having a  net worth ratio of less than five percent (5%), or a director, officer  or employee of such a credit union, if it determines that those actions  are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requiring prior approval for acquisitions, branching, new lines  of business. Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly,  acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution,  establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in  any new line of business, unless the NCUA Board has approved the credit  union's net worth restoration plan, the credit union is implementing its  plan, and the NCUA Board determines that the proposed action is  consistent with and will further the objectives of that plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO. Restrict  the credit union's transactions with a CUSO, or require the credit union  to reduce or divest its ownership interest in a CUSO;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restricting dividends paid. Restrict the dividend rates the  credit union pays on shares to the prevailing rates paid on comparable  accounts and maturities in the relevant market area, as determined by  the NCUA Board, except that dividend rates already declared on shares  acquired before imposing a restriction under this paragraph may not be  retroactively restricted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prohibiting or reducing asset growth. Prohibit any growth in the  credit union's assets or in a category of assets, or require the credit  union to reduce its assets or a category of assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alter, reduce or terminate activity. Require the credit union or  its CUSO   to alter, reduce, or terminate any activity which poses excessive risk  to the credit union;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prohibiting nonmember deposits. Prohibit the credit union from  accepting all or certain nonmember deposits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Dismissing director or senior executive officer. Require the  credit union to dismiss from office any director or senior executive  officer, provided however, that a dismissal under this clause shall not  be construed to be a formal administrative action for removal under 12  U.S.C. 1786(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Employing qualified senior executive officer. Require the credit  union to employ qualified senior executive officers (who, if the NCUA  Board so specifies, shall be subject to its approval); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other action to carry out prompt corrective action. Restrict or  require such other action by the credit union as the NCUA Board  determines will carry out the purpose of this part better than any of  the actions prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ``First tier'' application of discretionary supervisory actions.  An ``undercapitalized'' credit union having a net worth ratio of five  percent (5%) or more, or which is classified ``undercapitalized'' by  reason of failing to satisfy a risk-based net worth requirement under  Sec. 702.105 or 702.106, is subject to the discretionary supervisory  actions in paragraph (b) of this section if it fails to comply with any  mandatory supervisory action in paragraph (a) of this section or fails  to timely implement an approved net worth restoration plan under  Sec. 702.206, including meeting its prescribed steps to increase its net  worth ratio.
