An employee may, therefore, properly make  an address explaining and interpreting such a program, citing its  achievements, defending it against uninformed or unjust criticism,  pointing out the need for possible improvements, or soliciting views for  improving it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee shall not, either directly or indirectly, use  appropriated funds to influence a Member of Congress to favor or oppose  legislation in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1913. However, an employee is not  prohibited from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testifying as a representative of the Council on pending  legislation proposals before congressional committees on request;  provided, that the relevant provisions of the current OMB Circular A-14  (``Legislation Coordination and Clearance'') are complied with; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assisting congressional committees in drafting bills or reports  on request, when it is clear that the employee is serving solely as a  technical expert under the direction of committee leadership.</p>
