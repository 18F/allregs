logic model for the proposed process, product, strategy, or practice. Specifically, evidence of promise means the conditions in both paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this definition are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is at least one study that is a--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Quasi-experimental design study that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with reservations; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Randomized controlled trial that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with or without reservations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The study referenced in paragraph (i) of this definition found a statistically significant or substantively important (defined as a difference of 0.25 standard deviations or larger) favorable association between at least one critical component and one relevant outcome presented in the logic model for the proposed process, product, strategy, or practice.</p><p class="depth4">Facilities means one or more structures in one or more locations.</p><p class="depth4">Fiscal year means the Federal fiscal year--a period beginning on October 1 and ending on the following September 30.</p><p class="depth4">GEPA means The General Education Provisions Act.</p><p class="depth4">Grant means financial assistance, including cooperative agreements, that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. 2 CFR part 200, as adopted in 2 CFR part 3474, uses the broader, undefined term ``Award'' to cover grants, subgrants, and other agreements in the form of money or property, in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible recipient.

The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award notice (GAN). For example, a GAN may name as the grantee one school or campus of a university. In this case, the granting agency usually intends, or actually intends, that the named component assume primary or sole responsibility for administering the grant-assisted project or program. Nevertheless, the naming of a component of a legal entity as the grantee in a grant award document shall not be construed as relieving the whole legal entity from accountability to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. (This definition is not intended to affect the eligibility provision of grant programs in which eligibility is limited to organizations that may be only components of a legal entity.)

The term also includes the extension of utility lines, such as water and electricity, from points beyond the confines of the space in which the minor remodeling is undertaken but within the confines of the previously completed building.

These studies, depending on design and implementation, can meet What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with reservations (but not What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards without reservations).</p><p class="depth0">Randomized controlled trial means a study that employs random assignment of, for example, students, teachers, classrooms, schools, or districts to receive the intervention being evaluated (the treatment group) or not to receive the intervention (the control group).

The term includes financial assistance when provided by contractual or any other form of legal agreement, but does not include procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance that is excluded from the definition of ``grant or award'' in this part (See 2 CFR 200.92, ``Subaward'').</p><p class="depth4">Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a subgrant is awarded and that is accountable to the grantee for the use of the funds provided.</p><p class="depth4">What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards means the standards set forth in the What Works Clearinghouse Procedures and Standards Handbook (Version 3.0, March 2014), which can be found at the following link: http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/DocumentSum.aspx?sid=19.</p><p class="depth4">Work of art means an item that is incorporated into facilities primarily because of its aesthetic value.
