If necessary, information not supplied with the application will be requested by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special requirements.

Nor will the lender discriminate on the basis of whether all or a part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or whether the applicant in good faith, exercises any rights under the Consumer Protection Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, the lender will not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age, provided the applicant can execute a legal contract.
