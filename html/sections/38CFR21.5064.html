The amount of the contributions refunded upon  disenrollment shall be limited to the amount of his or her contributions  not utilized to receive benefits as of the date of disenrollment, less  any outstanding debts resulting from overpayments of educational  assistance allowance.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3223)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date of refund. The date upon which the refund of  contributions, if any, will be made shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an individual voluntarily disenrolls from the program before  discharge or release from active duty, VA will refund the individual's  unused contributions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On the date of the participant's discharge or release from  active duty; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 60 days of VA's receipt of notice of the individual's  discharge or disenrollment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As soon as possible after VA's receipt of notice indicating  that an earlier refund is needed due to hardship or for other good  reasons.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3223(b), 3232)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an individual voluntarily disenrolls from the program after  discharge or release from active duty under other than dishonorable  conditions, his or her contributions shall be refunded within 60 days of  receipt by VA of an application for a refund from the individual.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3202(1)(A), 3223(c), 3232(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an individual is disenrolled because he or she is discharged  or released from active duty under dishonorable conditions, the  individual's contributions remaining in the fund shall be refunded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On the date of the individual's discharge or release from active  duty; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 60 days of receipt of notice by the Department of  Veterans Affairs of the individual's discharge or release, whichever is  the later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an individual is disenrolled because he or she has not  utilized all of his or her entitlement to benefits within the 10-year  delimiting period, the individual's contributions remaining in the fund  shall be refunded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs shall notify the individual  that the delimiting period has expired and shall state the amount of  unused contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs shall make the refund only  if the individual requests it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If VA does not receive a request within 1 year from the date  that the individual is notified of his or her entitlement to a refund,  VA will presume that the individual's whereabouts is unknown. The funds  on deposit for that   individual will be transferred in accordance with the provisions of  section 1322(a), Title 31, United States Code.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101, 3223, 3232; Pub.
