                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this part, documents shall be filed  with the FAA during a proceeding under this part as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing address. Documents filed under this Part shall be filed  with the Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention: FAA Part 16 Docket  Clerk, AGC-600, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue  SW., Washington, DC 20591. Documents to be filed with a hearing officer  shall be filed at the address and in the manner stated in the hearing  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date and method of filing. Filing of any document shall be by  personal delivery or mail as defined in this part, by facsimile (when  confirmed by filing on the same date by one of the foregoing methods),  or electronically as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section. Unless  the date is shown to be inaccurate, documents filed with the FAA shall  be deemed to be filed on the date of personal delivery, on the mailing  date shown on the certificate of service, on the date shown on the  postmark if there is no certificate of service, on the send date shown  on the facsimile (provided filing has been confirmed through one of the  foregoing methods), or on the mailing date shown by other evidence if  there is no certificate of service and no postmark. Unless the date is  shown to be inaccurate, documents filed electronically shall be deemed  to be filed on the date shown on the certificate of service or, if none,  the date of electronic transmission to the last party required to be  served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Number of copies. With the exception of electronic filing or  unless otherwise specified, an executed original and three copies of  each document shall be filed with the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk. One of  the three copies shall not be stapled, bound or hole-punched. Copies  need not be signed, but the name of the person signing the original  shall be shown. If a hearing order has been issued in the case, one of  the three copies shall be filed with the hearing officer unless  otherwise prescribed by the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form. Documents filed under this part shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be typewritten or legibly printed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include, in the case of docketed proceedings, the docket number  of the proceeding on the front page; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be marked to identify personal, privileged or proprietary  information. Decisions for the publication and release of these  documents will be made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 and 49 CFR part  7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Signing of documents and other papers. The original of every  document filed shall be signed by the person filing it or the person's  duly authorized representative. The signature shall serve as a  certification that the signer has read the document and, based on  reasonable inquiry and to the best of the signer's knowledge,  information, and belief, the document is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Warranted by existing law or that a good faith argument exists  for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to  cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the  administrative process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Designation of person to receive service. The initial document  filed by any person shall state on the first page the name, physical  address, telephone number, facsimile number, if any, and email address,  if filing electronically, of the person(s) to be served with documents  in the proceeding. If any of these items change during the proceeding,  the person shall promptly file notice of the change with the FAA Part 16  Docket Clerk and the hearing officer and shall serve the notice on all  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Docket numbers. Each submission identified as a complaint under  this part by the submitting person will be assigned a docket number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Electronic filing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The initial complaint may be served  electronically upon the respondent only if the respondent has previously  agreed with the complainant in writing to participate in electronic  filing. Documents may be filed under this Part electronically by sending  an email containing (an) attachment(s) of (a) PDF file(s) of the  required pleading to the FAA Docket Clerk, and the person designated in  paragraph (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The subject line of the email must contain the names of the  complainant and respondent, and must contain the FAA docket number (if  assigned). The size of each email must be less than 10 MB. Email  attachments containing executable files (e.g., .exe and .vbs files) will  not be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The email address at which the parties may file the documents  described in this section is 9-AWA-AGC-Part-16@faa.gov. No  acknowledgement or receipt will be provided by the FAA to parties using  this method. A party filing electronically as described in this section  must provide to the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk and the opposing party an  email address of the person designated by the party to receive  pleadings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By filing a pleading or document electronically as described in  this section, a party waives the rights under this part for service by  the opposing party and the FAA by methods other than email. If a party  subsequently decides to ``opt-out'' of electronic filing, that party  must so notify the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk and the other party in  writing, from which time the FAA and the parties will begin serving the  opting-out party in accordance with Sec. Sec. 16.13 and 16.15. This  subsection only exempts the parties from the filing and service  requirements in Sec. 16.13(a) (with the exception that ``Documents to  be filed with a hearing officer shall be filed at the address and in the  manner stated in the hearing order.''), the method of filing  requirements in Sec. 16.13(b), and the number of documents requirements  in Sec. 16.13(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Internet accessibility of documents filed in the Hearing Docket.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless protected from public disclosure, all documents filed in the  Hearing Docket are accessible through the Federal Docket Management  System (FDMS): http://www.regulations.gov. To access a particular case  file, use the FDMS number assigned to the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determinations issued by the Director and Associate  Administrator in Part 16 cases, indexes of decisions, contact  information for the FAA Hearing Docket, the rules of practice, and other  information are available on the FAA Office of Airports' Web site at:  http://part16.airports.faa.gov/index.cfm.
