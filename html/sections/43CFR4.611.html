                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless you meet one of the criteria in Sec. 4.610(b), you must  file with your application a net worth exhibit that meets the  requirements of this section. The adjudicative officer may also require  that you file additional information to determine your eligibility for  an award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exhibit must show your net worth and that of any affiliates  when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provides full disclosure of your and your affiliates' assets and  liabilities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is sufficient to determine whether you qualify under the  standards in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public  record of the proceeding. However, if you object to public disclosure of  information in any portion of the exhibit and believe there are legal  grounds for withholding it from disclosure, you may submit that portion  of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope  labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion  to withhold the information from public disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The motion must describe the information sought to be withheld  and explain, in detail:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Why it falls within one or more of the exemptions from mandatory  disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect  you; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Why disclosure is not required in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must serve the net worth exhibit and motion on counsel  representing the agency against which you seek an award, but you are not  required to serve it on any other party to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should  not be withheld from disclosure, it must be placed in the public record  of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit  will be disposed of in accordance with the Department's procedures under  the Freedom of Information Act, 43 CFR 2.7 et seq.</p>
