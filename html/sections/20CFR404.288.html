                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After entitlement to old-age or disability insurance benefits.  If you first become eligible for old-age or disability insurance  benefits after 1985 and you later become entitled to a monthly pension  based on noncovered employment, we may recompute your primary insurance  amount under the rules in Sec. 404.213. When recomputing, we will use  the amount of the pension to which you are entitled or deemed entitled  in the first month that you are concurrently eligible for both the  pension and   old-age or disability insurance benefits. We will disregard the rule in  Sec. 404.284(e) that the recomputation must increase your primary  insurance amount by at least $1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Already entitled to benefits and to a pension based on  noncovered employment. If we have already computed or recomputed your  primary insurance amount to take into account your monthly pension, we  may later recompute for one of the reasons explained in Sec. 404.281. We  will recompute your primary insurance amount under the rules in  Secs. 404.213 and 404.284. Any increase resulting from the recomputation  under the rules of Sec. 404.284 will be added to the most recent primary  insurance amount which we had computed to take into account your monthly  pension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After your death. If one or more survivors are entitled to  benefits after your death, we will recompute the primary insurance  amount as though it had never been affected by your entitlement to a  monthly pension based in whole or in part on noncovered employment.
