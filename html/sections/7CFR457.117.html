Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic  Provisions, the following will apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have  started if the insured crop will not be harvested;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from  any unit will be sold by direct marketing unless you have records  verifying that the forage was direct marketed. Failure to give timely  notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in  an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the  production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability  to make the required appraisal;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify  us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously  gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions so  that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not destroy the  damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If  you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure  results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such  production will be considered undamaged and will be included as  production to count; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must notify us at least 5 days before grazing of insured  forage begins so we can conduct an appraisal to determine production to  count. Failure to give timely notice that the acreage will be grazed  will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less  than the production guarantee per acre.</p><p class="depth0">10. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you  are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for  which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production  to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage  for the units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, by its respective  production guarantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective  price election you selected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if  applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election you  selected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(4);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in  section 11(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1</p><p class="depth3">Assume you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A forage in  the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price election of  $65.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to harvest  50.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth3">1. 100 acres type A x 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee;</p><p class="depth3">2 & 3. 300 tons x $65 price election = $19,500 total value  guarantee;</p><p class="depth3">4 & 5. 50 tons production to count x $65 price election = $3,250  total value of production to count;</p><p class="depth3">6. $19,500 value guarantee--$3,250 = $16,250 loss; and</p><p class="depth3">7. $16,250 x 100 percent share = $16,250 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2</p><p class="depth3">Assume you also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B  forage in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per acre and a  price election of $50.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only  able to harvest 5.0 tons. Your total indemnity for forage production for  both types A and B in the same unit would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth3">1. 100 acres x 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee for type A; and 100 acres  x 1 ton = 100 ton guarantee for type B;</p><p class="depth3">2. 300 ton guarantee x $65 price election = $19,500 total value of  the guarantee for type A; and 100 ton guarantee x $50 price election =  $5,000 total value of the guarantee for type B;</p><p class="depth3">3. $19,500 + $5,000 = $24,500 total value of the guarantee;</p><p class="depth3">4. 50 tons x $65 price election = $3,250 total value of production  to count for type A; and 5 tons x $50 price election = $250 total value  of production to count for type B;</p><p class="depth3">5. $3,250 + $250 = $ 3,500 total value of production to count for  types A and B;</p><p class="depth3">6. $24,500--$3,500 = $21,000 loss; and</p><p class="depth3">7. $21,000 loss x 100 percent share = $21,000 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable  acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Put to another use without our consent;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For which you fail to provide production records that are  acceptable to us;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested production;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put  to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount  of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that  acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the  crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached  and:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> You do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give  you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave  intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the  crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count  for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals  from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not  leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care  for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put  the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of  production to count); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> You elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of  production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or  our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not  harvested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When forage is harvested as other than air-dry forage, the  production to count will be adjusted to the equivalent of air-dry  forage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any harvested production from plants growing in the forage will  be counted as forage on a weight basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition to the provisions of section 15 (Production Included  in Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we  may determine the amount of production of any unharvested forage on the  basis of our field appraisals conducted after the normal time for each  cutting for the area.</p><p class="depth2">11.
