                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">With any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of  disability, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or  manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to  affected joints. Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification.  Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. The  intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or  periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention  to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to  healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating  for the joint. Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the  tendons or ligaments, or crepitation within the joint structures should  be noted carefully as points of contact which are diseased. Flexion  elicits such manifestations. The joints involved should be tested for  pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight- bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged  joint.
