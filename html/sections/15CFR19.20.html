                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offset of Commerce entity payments to collect debts owed to  other Federal agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In most cases, Federal agencies submit debts  to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments  issued by Commerce entities and other Federal agencies, a process known  as ``centralized offset.'' When centralized offset is not available or  appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a Commerce entity (when acting  as a ``payment agency'') to collect a debt owed to such agency by  offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Commerce entity, including  salary payments issued to Commerce entity employees. This section and  Sec. 19.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks a  Commerce entity to offset a payment issued by the Commerce entity to a  person who owes a debt to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart C does not apply to Commerce debts. See Sec. Sec.  19.10 through 19.12 of this Part for offset procedures applicable to  Commerce debts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This subpart C does not apply to the collection of non-Commerce  debts through tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.2 for tax refund offset  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification.  A Commerce entity will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of  written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the  past-due, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the  creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and  other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, and the  creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue  until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction  of the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset. Requests for  offset under this section shall be sent to the Department of Commerce,  ATTN: Deputy Chief Financial Officer, 1401 Constitution Avenue, NW.,  Room 6827, Washington, DC 20230. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer will  forward the request to the appropriate Commerce entity for processing in  accordance with this subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Incomplete certification. A Commerce entity will return an  incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that  the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section  before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by a  Commerce entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review. A Commerce entity is not authorized to review the merits  of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or  validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When Commerce entities will not comply with offset request. A  Commerce entity will comply with the offset request of another agency  unless the Commerce entity determines that the offset would not be in  the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary  to law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiple debts. When two or more creditor agencies are seeking  offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts  are owed to a single creditor agency, the Commerce entity that has been  asked to offset the payments may determine the order in which the debts  will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by  offset simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Priority of debts owed to Commerce entity. For purposes of this  section, debts owed to a Commerce entity generally take precedence over  debts owed to other agencies. The Commerce entity that has been asked to  offset the payments may determine whether to pay debts owed to other  agencies before paying a debt owed to a Commerce entity. The Commerce  entity that has been asked to offset the payments will determine the  order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests  of the United States.</p>
