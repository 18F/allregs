                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section describes how to verify the accuracy of the dynamometer's timing device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform this verification upon initial installation and after major maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. Perform this verification using one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> WWV method. You may use the time and frequency signal broadcast by NIST from radio station WWV as the time standard if the trigger for the dynamometer timing circuit has a frequency decoder circuit, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contact station WWV by telephone by dialing (303) 499-7111 and listen for the time announcement. Verify that the trigger started the dynamometer timer. Use good engineering judgment to minimize error in receiving the time and frequency signal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After at least 1000 seconds, re-dial station WWV and listen for the time announcement. Verify that the trigger stopped the dynamometer timer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compare the measured elapsed time, yact, to the corresponding time standard, yref, to determine the time error, yerror, using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.063</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ramping method. You may use an operator-defined ramp function to serve as the time standard as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set up a signal generator to output a marker voltage at the peak of each ramp to trigger the dynamometer timing circuit. Output the designated marker voltage to start the verification period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After at least 1000 seconds, output the designated marker voltage to end the verification period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compare the measured elapsed time between marker signals, yact, to the corresponding time standard, yref, to determine the time error, yerror, using Eq. 1066.230-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dynamometer coastdown method. You may use a signal generator to output a known speed ramp signal to the dynamometer controller to serve as the time standard as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Generate upper and lower speed values to trigger the start and stop functions of the coastdown timer circuit. Use the signal generator to start the verification period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After at least 1000 seconds, use the signal generator to end the verification period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compare the measured elapsed time between trigger signals, yact, to the corresponding time standard, yref, to determine the time error, yerror, using Eq. 1066.230-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance evaluation. The time error determined in paragraph (c) of this section may not exceed 0.001%.</p>
