                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Means of collection. Collection of a debt may be made by means of offset under Sec. 831.1306, or under any statutory provision providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government, or by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, as provided in Sec. 831.1306. Referral may also be made to a collection agency under the provisions of the FCCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional charges. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed on the debt in accordance with standards established in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13. Additional charges will be waived when required by the FCCS. In addition, such charges may be waived when OPM determines--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the standards prescribed in Sec. Sec. 831.1403 through 831.1405 of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waiver would be in the best interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection in installments. Whenever feasible, debts will be collected in one lump sum. However, when the debtor is financially unable to pay in one lump sum of fails to respond to a demand for full payment and off-set is available, installment payments may be effected. The amount of the installment payments will be set in accordance with the criteria in 4 CFR 102.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commencement of collection. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for requesting further rights stated in Sec. 831.1304(a)(6) expire or OPM has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a waiver denial, unless: (i) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in Sec. 831.1304 or litigation. When offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for requesting further rights stated in Sec. 831.1304(a)(6) expire or OPM has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a waiver denial, unless: (i) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in Sec. 831.1304 or litigation.

formal determination is made, whichever is later.</p>
