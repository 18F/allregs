                                Sec. 20.2044-1  Certain property for which marital deduction was
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2044 generally provides for the inclusion in  the gross estate of property in which the decedent had a qualifying  income interest for life and for which a deduction was allowed under  section 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f). The value of the property included in the  gross estate under section 2044 is not reduced by the amount of any  section 2503(b) exclusion that applied to the transfer creating the  interest. See section 2207A, regarding the right of recovery against the  persons receiving the property that is applicable in certain cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Passed from. For purposes of section 1014 and chapters 11 and 13  of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code, property included in a  decedent's gross estate under section 2044 is considered to have been  acquired from or to have passed from the decedent to the person  receiving the property upon the decedent's death. Thus, for example, the  property is treated as passing from the decedent for purposes of  determining the availability of the charitable deduction under section  2055, the marital deduction under section 2056, and special use  valuation under section 2032A. In addition, the tax imposed on property  includible under section 2044 is eligible for the installment payment of  estate tax under section 6166.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presumption. Unless established to the contrary, section 2044  applies to the entire value of the trust at the surviving spouse's  death. If a marital deduction is taken on either the estate or gift tax  return with respect to the transfer which created the qualifying income  interest, it is presumed that the deduction was allowed for purposes of  section 2044. To avoid the inclusion of property in the decedent- spouse's gross estate under this section, the executor of the spouse's  estate must establish that a deduction was not taken for the transfer  which created the qualifying income interest. For example, to establish  that a deduction was not taken, the executor may produce a copy of the  estate or gift tax return filed with respect to the transfer by the  first spouse or the first spouse's estate establishing that no deduction  was taken under section 2523(f) or section 2056(b)(7). In addition, the  executor may establish that no return was filed on the original transfer  by the decedent because the value of the first spouse's gross estate was  below the threshold requirement for filing under section 6018.  Similarly, the executor could establish that the transfer creating the  decedent's qualifying income interest for life was made before the  effective date of section 2056(b)(7) or section 2523(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount included--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The amount included under this  section is the value of the entire interest   in which the decedent had a qualifying income interest for life,  determined as of the date of the decedent's death (or the alternate  valuation date, if applicable). If, in connection with the transfer of  property that created the decedent's qualifying income interest for  life, a deduction was allowed under section 2056(b)(7) or section  2523(f) for less than the entire interest in the property (i.e., for a  fractional or percentage share of the entire interest in the transferred  property), the amount includible in the decedent's gross estate under  this section is equal to the fair market value of the entire interest in  the property on the date of the decedent's death (or the alternate  valuation date, if applicable) multiplied by the fractional or  percentage share of the interest for which the deduction was taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inclusion of income. If any income from the property for the  period between the date of the transfer creating the decedent-spouse's  interest and the date of the decedent-spouse's death has not been  distributed before the decedent-spouse's death, the undistributed income  is included in the decedent-spouse's gross estate under this section to  the extent that the income is not so included under any other section of  the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reduction of includible share in certain cases. If only a  fractional or percentage share is includible under this section, the  includible share is appropriately reduced if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The decedent-spouse's interest was in a trust and distributions  of principal were made to the spouse during the spouse's lifetime;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The trust provides that the distributions are to be made from  the qualified terminable interest share of the trust; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The executor of the decedent-spouse's estate can establish the  reduction in that share based on the fair market value of the trust  assets at the time of each distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interest in previously severed trust. If the decedent-spouse's  interest was in a trust consisting of only qualified terminable interest  property and the trust was severed (in compliance with Sec. 20.2056(b)- 7(b) or Sec. 25.2523(f)-1(b) of this chapter) from a trust that, after  the severance, held only property that was not qualified terminable  interest property, only the value of the property in the severed portion  of the trust is includible in the decedent-spouse's gross estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles in  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, where the decedent, D, was  survived by spouse, S.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Inclusion of trust subject to election. Under D's will,  assets valued at $800,000 in D's gross estate (net of debts, expenses  and other charges, including death taxes, payable from the property)  passed in trust with income payable to S for life. Upon S's death, the  trust principal is to be distributed to D's children. D's executor  elected under section 2056(b)(7) to treat the entire trust property as  qualified terminable interest property and claimed a marital deduction  of $800,000. S made no disposition of the income interest during S's  lifetime under section 2519. On the date of S's death, the fair market  value of the trust property was $740,000. S's executor did not elect the  alternate valuation date. The amount included in S's gross estate  pursuant to section 2044 is $740,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Inclusion of trust subject to partial election. The facts  are the same as in Example 1, except that D's executor elected under  section 2056(b)(7) with respect to only 50 percent of the value of the  trust ($400,000). Consequently, only the equivalent portion of the trust  is included in S's gross estate; i.e., $370,000 (50 percent of  $740,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Spouse receives qualifying income interest in a fraction  of trust income. Under D's will, assets valued at $800,000 in D's gross  estate (net of debts, expenses and other charges, including death taxes,  payable from the property) passed in trust with 20 percent of the trust  income payable to S for S's life. The will provides that the trust  principal is to be distributed to D's children upon S's death. D's  executor elected to deduct, pursuant to section 2056(b)(7), 50 percent  of the amount for which the election could be made; i.e., $80,000 (50  percent of 20 percent of $800,000). Consequently, on the death of S,  only the equivalent portion of the trust is included in S's gross  estate; i.e., $74,000 (50 percent of 20 percent of $740,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Distribution of corpus during spouse's lifetime. The  facts are the same as in Example 3, except that S was entitled to  receive all the trust income but the executor of D's estate elected  under section 2056(b)(7) with respect to only 50 percent of the value of  the trust ($400,000). Pursuant to authority in the will, the trustee  made a discretionary distribution of $100,000 of principal to S in 1995  and charged the entire distribution to   the qualified terminable interest share. Immediately prior to the  distribution, the fair market value of the trust property was $1,100,000  and the qualified terminable interest portion of the trust was 50  percent. Immediately after the distribution, the qualified terminable  interest portion of the trust was 45 percent ($450,000 divided by  $1,000,000). Provided S's executor can establish the relevant facts, the  amount included in S's gross estate is $333,000 (45 percent of  $740,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Spouse assigns a portion of income interest during life.  Under D's will, assets valued at $800,000 in D's gross estate (net of  debts, expenses and other charges, including death taxes, payable from  the property) passed in trust with all the income payable to S, for S's  life. The will provides that the trust principal is to be distributed to  D's children upon S's death. D's executor elected under section  2056(b)(7) to treat the entire trust property as qualified terminable  interest property and claimed a marital deduction of $800,000. During  the term of the trust, S transfers to C the right to 40 percent of the  income from the trust for S's life. Because S is treated as transferring  the entire remainder interest in the trust corpus under section 2519 (as  well as 40 percent of the income interest under section 2511), no part  of the trust is includible in S's gross estate under section 2044.  However, if S retains until death an income interest in 60 percent of  the trust corpus (which corpus is treated pursuant to section 2519 as  having been transferred by S for both gift and estate tax purposes), 60  percent of the property will be includible in S's gross estate under  section 2036(a) and a corresponding adjustment is made in S's adjusted  taxable gifts.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Inter vivos trust subject to election under section  2523(f). D transferred $800,000 to a trust providing that trust income  is to be paid annually to S, for S's life. The trust provides that upon  S's death, $100,000 of principal is to be paid to X charity and the  remaining principal distributed to D's children. D elected to treat all  of the property transferred to the trust as qualified terminable  interest property under section 2523(f). At the time of S's death, the  fair market value of the trust is $1,000,000. S's executor does not  elect the alternate valuation date. The amount included in S's gross  estate is $1,000,000; i.e., the fair market value at S's death of the  entire trust property. The $100,000 that passes to X charity on S's  death is treated as a transfer by S to X charity for purposes of section  2055. Therefore, S's estate is allowed a charitable deduction for the  $100,000 transferred from the trust to the charity to the same extent  that a deduction would be allowed by section 2055 for a bequest by S to  X charity.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Spousal interest in the form of an annuity. D died prior  to October 24, 1992, the effective date of the Energy Policy Act of 1992  (Pub. L. 102-486). See Sec. 20.2056(b)-7(e). Under D's will, assets  valued at $500,000 in D's gross estate (net of debts, expenses and other  charges, including death taxes, payable from the property) passed in  trust pursuant to which an annuity of $20,000 a year was payable to S  for S's life. Trust income not paid to S as an annuity is to be  accumulated in the trust and may not be distributed during S's lifetime.  D's estate deducted $200,000 under section 2056(b)(7) and Sec.  20.2056(b)-7(e)(2). S did not assign any portion of S's interest during  S's life. At the time of S's death, the value of the trust property is  $800,000. S's executor does not elect the alternate valuation date. The  amount included in S's gross estate pursuant to section 2044 is $320,000  ([$200,000/$500,000]x$800,000).</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Inclusion of trust property when surviving spouse dies  before first decedent's estate tax return is filed. D dies on July 1,  1997. Under the terms of D's will, a trust is established for the  benefit of D's spouse, S. The will provides that S is entitled to  receive the income from that portion of the trust that the executor  elects to treat as qualified terminable interest property. The remaining  portion of the trust passes as of D's date of death to a trust for the  benefit of C, D's child. The trust terms otherwise provide S with a  qualifying income interest for life under section 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii). S  dies on February 10, 1998. On April 1, 1998, D's executor files D's  estate tax return on which an election is made to treat a portion of the  trust as qualified terminable interest property under section  2056(b)(7). S's estate tax return is filed on November 10, 1998. The  value on the date of S's death of the portion of the trust for which D's  executor made a QTIP election is includible in S's gross estate under  section 2044.  [T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9646, Mar. 1, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8779, 63 FR  44393, Aug. 19, 1998]</p>
