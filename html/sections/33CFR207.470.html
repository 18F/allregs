                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority of canal officers. The movement of all boats and  floating things in the canal and in the approaches thereto shall be  under the direction of the superintendent or his authorized assistants,  and their orders and instructions must be obeyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signals. On entering the canal at either entrance, steamers or  tugs must blow their whistles for 1 minute in order to warn craft  approaching from   opposite direction and give them time to guard against collisions, by  tying up if necessary. All steamers approaching others going in the  opposite direction shall slacken speed so as to pass in safety.  Compliance is required with rule V of the rules and regulations for the  government of pilots, adopted by the U.S. Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2">Rule V. Whenever a steamer is nearing a short bend or curve in the  channel where, from the height of the banks or other cause, a steamer  approaching from the opposite direction cannot be seen for a distance of  half a mile, the pilot of such steamer, when he shall have arrived  within half a mile of such curve or bend, shall give a signal by one  long blast of the steam whistle, which signal shall be answered by a  similar blast by the pilot of any approaching steamer that may be within  hearing. Should such signal be so answered by a steamer upon the farther  side of such bend, then the usual signals for the meeting and passing  shall immediately be given and answered; but if the first alarm signal  of such pilot be not answered, he is to consider the channel clear and  govern himself accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Speed. The rate of speed while passing through the canal shall  not exceed 5 miles per hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Keeping in the center. The center must be kept all the way  through, except in passing other craft. In case of grounding, the rapid  or strong working of boat's engines is strictly forbidden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)-(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Rafts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The passage of bag or sack rafts, or of loose logs,  into or through the canal is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rafts shall be made up with logs parallel to each other, in the  direction of raft lengths, secured and held closely together by frequent  cross-sticks, chains, or cables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rafts shall not be of greater dimensions, either way, than 50  feet wide by 600 feet long, and if longer than 300 feet shall be handled  by two tugs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No raft shall pass through the canal, unless by special  permission of the superintendent or his authorized assistants, who will  direct a time for passing that will least interfere with other  navigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Masters of tugs and other persons in charge of rafts are  required to avoid damaging the canal revetments, and displacing buoys,  spars, or the pedestal of any range light aiding navigation through the  canal. They shall keep careful watch when passing aids to navigation,  and should any be accidentally displaced, shall report the fact at the  earliest possible moment to the superintendent or his authorized  assistants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)-(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Refuse in canal. No person shall roll or throw any stones,  ashes, cinders, or other material into the canal or the approaches  thereto, or place any such material on any bank or berm of the canal so  that it is liable to be thrown or roll in.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)-(o)</em> [Reserved]  [Regs., Feb. 15, 1895, as amended Apr. 14, 1908; 42 FR 57962, Nov. 7,  1977; 56 FR 13765, Apr. 4, 1991]</p>
