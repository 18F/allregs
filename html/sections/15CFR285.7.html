                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Frequency and scheduling. Before initial accreditation, during  the first renewal year, and every two years thereafter, an on-site  assessment of each laboratory is conducted to determine compliance with  the NVLAP criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessors. NVLAP shall select qualified assessors to evaluate  all information collected from an applicant laboratory pursuant to Sec.  285.6 of this part and to conduct the assessment on its behalf at the  laboratory and any other sites where activities to be covered by the  accreditation are performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conduct of assessment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assessors use checklists provided by  NVLAP so that each laboratory receives an assessment comparable to that  received by others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the assessment, the assessor meets with management and  laboratory personnel, examines the quality system, reviews staff  information, examines equipment and facilities, observes demonstrations  of testing or calibrations, and examines tests or calibration reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The assessor reviews laboratory records including resumes, job  descriptions of key personnel, training, and   competency evaluations for all staff members who routinely perform, or  affect the quality of the testing or calibration for which accreditation  is sought. The assessor need not be given information which violates  individual privacy, such as salary, medical information, or performance  reviews outside the scope of the accreditation program. The staff  information may be kept in the laboratory's official personnel folders  or separate folders that contain only the information that the NVLAP  assessor needs to review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the conclusion of the assessment, the assessor conducts an  exit briefing to discuss observations and any deficiencies with the  authorized representative who signed the NVLAP application and other  responsible laboratory staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assessment report. At the exit briefing, the assessor submits a  written report on the compliance of the laboratory with the  accreditation requirements, together with the completed checklists,  where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deficiency notification and resolution. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Laboratories are  informed of deficiencies during the on-site assessment, and deficiencies  are documented in the assessment report (see paragraph (d) of this  section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A laboratory shall, within thirty days of the date of the  assessment report, provide documentation that the specified deficiencies  have either been corrected and/or a plan of corrective actions as  described in the NVLAP handbooks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If substantial deficiencies have been cited, NVLAP may require  an additional on-site assessment, at additional cost to the laboratory,  prior to granting accreditation. All deficiencies and resolutions will  be subject to thorough review and evaluation prior to an accreditation  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the assessor submits their final report, NVLAP reviews the  report and the laboratory's response to determine if the laboratory has  met all of the on-site assessment requirements.</p>
