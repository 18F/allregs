In the absence of such affidavit the application will be rejected. If properly supported, the application will be received and suspended subject to a hearing to determine the swamp or nonswamp character of the land, the burden of proof being upon the non-swamp claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In those States where the survey returns are not made the basis for adjudication of the swamp-land selections, junior applications for lands covered by swamp-land selections may be

received and suspended, if supported by non-swamp affidavits corroborated by two witnesses, subject to hearing to determine the character of the land, whether swamp or non-swamp, and the burden of proof will be upon the junior applicant. Likewise, the State, if a junior applicant, may be heard upon furnishing an affidavit corroborated by two witnesses alleging that the land is swamp in character within the meaning of the swamp-land grant, in which case the burden of proof at the hearing will be upon the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where hearings are ordered in any such cases, the Rules of Practice governing contests will be applied, except as herein otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 2627_Alaska</p><p class="depth2">Source: 35 FR 9611, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.</p>
