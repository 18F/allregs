                                Sec. 1050.3  What conditions apply to the Charitable Choice provisions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">These Charitable Choice provisions apply whenever the Federal  government, or a State or local government, uses funds under the CSBG  Act to provide awards, contracts, or other assistance under any program  authorized in the Community Services Block Grant, 42 U.S.C. 9901, et  seq. Additionally, these provisions apply whenever an intermediate  organization acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with a  Federal, State, or local government entity selects nongovernmental  organizations to provide assistance under any of the programs authorized  under the Community Services Block Grant Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as  any other organization, to participate in the applicable programs as  long as they use program funds consistent with the Establishment Clause  and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States  Constitution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Neither the Federal government nor a State or local government  receiving funds under an applicable program shall discriminate against  an organization that applies to provide, or provides, services or  benefits on the basis of the organization's religious character or  affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No program participant that receives direct funding under an  applicable program may expend the program funds for inherently religious  activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.  If an organization conducts such activities, it must offer them  separately, in time or location, from the programs or services directly  funded under any applicable program, and participation must be voluntary  for program beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A religious organization that participates in an applicable  program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local  governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the  definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided  that it does not expend any direct funding under the applicable program  to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,  religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, religious  organizations may use space in their facilities to provide services  funded under an applicable program without removing religious art,  icons, scriptures, or other symbols. In addition, such a religious  organization retains the authority over its internal governance, and it  may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board  members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its  organization's   mission statements and other governing documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The participation of a religious organization in, or its receipt  of funds from, an applicable program does not affect that organization's  exemption provided under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1 regarding employment  practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A religious organization that receives funds under an applicable  program, shall not, in providing program services or benefits,  discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program  beneficiary on the basis of religion or a religious belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Religious organizations that receive funds under an applicable  program are subject to the same regulations as other nongovernmental  organizations to account, in accordance with generally accepted auditing  and accounting principles, for the use of such funds. In addition,  religious organizations are required to keep any Federal funds they  receive for services segregated in a separate account from non-Federal  funds. Only the segregated government funds are subject to audit by the  government under the applicable program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a State or local government contributes its own funds to  supplement CSBG Act funded activities, the State or local government has  the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if  the funds are commingled, the Charitable Choice provisions apply to all  of the commingled funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a nongovernmental intermediate organization, acting under a  grant, contract, or other agreement with the Federal, State or local  government, is given the authority to select nongovernmental  organizations to provide services under an applicable program, then the  intermediate organization must ensure that there is compliance with  these Charitable Choice provisions. The intermediate organization  retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under the  Charitable Choice provisions.</p>
