Advice regarding FMV shall be provided to DRMS by USDA, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the high bid for a sale item does not equal or exceed the FMV, DRMS is vested with the discretion to reject all bids and reoffer the item:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On another wildfire suppression sale if there is indication that reoffer may be successful, or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With DLA concurrence, as normal surplus under the FPMR if there is no such indication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disposition of proceeds from sale of aircraft under the Act will be as prescribed in guidance from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Purchases shall certify that aircraft and aircraft parts will be used only in accordance with conditions stated in Sec. 171.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales solicitations will require bidders to submit end-use certificates with their bids, stating the intended use and proposed areas of operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The completed end-use certificates shall be used in the bid evaluation process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sales contracts shall include terms and conditions for verifying and enforcing the use of the aircraft and aircraft parts in accordance with provisions of this guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DRMS Sales Contracting Officer (SCO) is responsible for verifying and enforcing the use of aircraft and aircraft parts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sales contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sales contracts include provisions for on-site visits to the purchaser's place(s) of business and/or worksite(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sales contracts require the purchaser to make available to the SCO, upon his or her request, all records concerning the use of aircraft and aircraft parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> USDA shall nominate in writing, and the SCO shall appoint, qualified Government employees (not contract employees) to serve as Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) for the purpose of conducting on-site verification and enforcement of the use of aircraft and aircraft parts for those purposes permitted by the sales contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> COR appointments must be in writing and must state the COR's duties, the limitations of the appointment, and the reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> USDA bears all COR costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The SCO may reject any COR nominee for cause, or terminate any COR appointment for cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) requirements in Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, paragraphs B 2 b (4)(d)2 through (40)(d)5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts regime in Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, paragraph B 26 c and

Resales are only permitted to other entities which, at time of resale, meet the qualifications required of initial purchasers. The SCO must seek, and USDA must provide, written assurance as to the acceptability of a prospective repurchaser before approving resale. Resales will normally be approved for airtanker contracts which have completed their contracts, or which have had their contracts terminated, or which can provide other valid reasons for seeking resale which are acceptable to the SCO.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If it is determined by the SCO that there is no interest in the aircraft or aircraft parts being offered for resale among entities deemed qualified repurchasers by USDA, the SCO may permit resale to entities outside the airtanker industry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When an aircraft or aircraft parts are determined to be uneconomically repairable and suitable only for cannibalization and/or scrapping, the purchaser shall advise the SCO in writing and provide evidence in the form of a technical inspection document from a qualified FAA airframe and powerplant mechanic, or equivalent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The policy outlined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section also applies to resales by repurchasers, and to all other manner of proposed title transfer (including, but no limited to, exchange and barters).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sales of aircraft and aircraft parts under the Act are intended for principals only. Sales offerings will caution prospective purchasers not to buy with the expectation of acting as brokers, dealers, agents, or middlemen for other interested parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The failure of a purchaser to comply with the sales contract terms and conditions may be cause for suspension and/or debarment, in addition to other administrative, contractual, civil, and criminal (including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001) remedies which may be available to DOD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Aircraft parts will be made available in two ways:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> DRMS may, based on availability and demand, offer for sale under the Act whole unflyable aircraft, aircraft carcasses for cannibalization, or aircraft parts, utilizing substantially the same provisions outlined in paragraphs (a) through (d)(6) of this section for flyable aircraft.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If USDA directs that DRMS set aside parts for sale under the Act, USDA must provide listings of parts required, by National Stock Number and Condition Code.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Only qualified airtanker operators which fly the end-term aircraft will be allowed to purchase unflyable aircraft, aircraft carcasses, or aircraft parts applicable to that end-item.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> FMVs are not required for aircraft parts. DRMS must utilize historic prices received for similar parts in making sale determinations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As an agency of the Federal Government, USDA remains eligible to receive no-cost transfers of excess DOD aircraft parts under the FPMR.</p>
