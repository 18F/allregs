                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each track owner shall determine the load capacity of each of  its railroad bridges. The load capacity need not be the ultimate or  maximum load capacity, but must be a safe load capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The load capacity of each bridge shall be documented in the  track owner's bridge management program, together with the method by  which the capacity was determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The determination of load capacity shall be made by a railroad  bridge engineer using appropriate engineering methods and standards that  are particularly applicable to railroad bridges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bridge load capacity may be determined from existing design and   modification records of a bridge, provided that the bridge substantially  conforms to its recorded configuration. Otherwise, the load capacity of  a bridge shall be determined by measurement and calculation of the  properties of its individual components, or other methods as determined  by a railroad bridge engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a track owner has a group of bridges for which the load  capacity has not already been determined, the owner shall schedule the  evaluation of those bridges according to their relative priority, as  established by a railroad bridge engineer. The initial determination of  load capacity shall be completed not later than five years following the  required date for adoption of the track owner's bridge management  program in conformance with Sec. 237.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where a bridge inspection reveals that, in the determination of  the railroad bridge engineer, the condition of a bridge or a bridge  component might adversely affect the ability of the bridge to carry the  traffic being operated, a new capacity shall be determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Bridge load capacity may be expressed in terms of numerical  values related to a standard system of bridge loads, but shall in any  case be stated in terms of weight and length of individual or combined  cars and locomotives, for the use of transportation personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Bridge load capacity may be expressed in terms of both normal  and maximum load conditions. Operation of equipment that produces forces  greater than the normal capacity shall be subject to any restrictions or  conditions that may be prescribed by a railroad bridge engineer.</p>
