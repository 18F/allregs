For the purpose of proving eligibility, a child is considered to be pursuing a full-time course of study or training during an interval between school periods that does not exceed 150 days if he has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department concerned that he has a bona fide intention of commencing, resuming, or continuing to pursue a full-time course of study or training in a recognized educational institution immediately after that interval.</p>
