For each smelting furnace, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each smelting furnace, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(b). Process off-gas from a smelting furnace is generated when copper ore concentrates and fluxes are being smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each smelting furnace, you must control the process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the smelting furnace according to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the smelting furnace, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use. The design and placement of this capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the capture system used to comply with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section any gases that contain total particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Slag cleaning vessels. For each slag cleaning vessel, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section that apply to you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each slag cleaning vessel, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an alternative to complying with the emission limit for nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each existing slag cleaning vessel you may choose to comply with the emission limit for

total particulate matter specified in this paragraph (c)(2). You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains total particulate matter in excess of 46 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each slag cleaning vessel, you must control process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the slag cleaning vessel according to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the slag cleaning vessel, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use.

For each existing copper converter department, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section that apply to you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must operate a capture system that collects the process off gas vented from each batch copper converter. At all times when one or more batch copper converters are blowing, you must operate the capture system according to the written operation and maintenance plan that has been prepared according to the requirements in Sec. 63.1447(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your copper converter department uses Pierce-Smith converters, the capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the entire mouth of the converter vessel when the copper converter is positioned for blowing. Additional hoods (e.g., secondary hoods) or other capture devices must be included in the capture system design as needed to achieve the opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The capture system design may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and individual duct segments may be connected to separate control devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your copper converter department uses Hoboken converters, the capture system must collect all process off-gas vented during blowing through the side-flue intake on each converter vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must operate the capture system such that any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department meet the opacity limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The opacity of any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department must not exceed 4 percent as determined by a performance test conducted according to Sec. 63.1450(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section applies only at those times when a performance test is conducted according to Sec. 63.1450(c). The requirements for compliance with opacity and visible emission standards specified in Sec. 63.6(h) do not apply to this opacity limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any Pierce-Smith converter primary hood capture system or Hoboken converter side-flue intake capture system any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any secondary capture system any gases that contain total particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in Sec. 63.1450(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> New copper converter departments. For each new copper converter department for which construction commenced on or after April 20, 1998, the

use of batch copper converters is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Baghouses. For each baghouse applied to meet any total particulate matter emission limit in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, you must operate the baghouse such that the bag leak detection system does not alarm for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in any semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Venturi wet scrubbers. For each venturi wet scrubber applied to meet any total particulate matter emission limit in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, you must maintain the hourly average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate at or above the minimum levels established during the initial or subsequent performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Other control devices. For each control device other than a baghouse or venturi wet scrubber applied to meet any total particulate matter emission limit in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, you must operate the control device as specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must select one or more operating parameters, as appropriate for the control device design, that can be used as representative and reliable indicators of the control device operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must maintain the hourly average value for each of the selected parameters at or above the minimum level or at or below the maximum level, as appropriate for the selected parameter, established during the initial or subsequent performance test.</p>
