Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of Sec.  63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements of subpart A of this part. The owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements in subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 of this subpart. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Malfunction recordkeeping and reporting. (i) Records of malfunctions. The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Records of malfunctions. The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures.

If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time, and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For new affected sources, each owner or operator shall comply with the provisions in Sec.  63.5 regarding construction and reconstruction, excluding the provisions specified in Sec.  63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recordkeeping and documentation.

If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to Sec.  63.1314(a)(9) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (10) of this section apply. As described in Sec.  63.1314(a)(9), certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph. Owners and operators of such storage vessels shall keep records as specified in the monitoring plan required by Sec.  63.1314(a)(9). Paragraphs (d)(8) and (d)(9) of this section specify documentation requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once every 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall record either each measured data value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period.

If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and recording a daily average (or batch cycle daily average) for that operating day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed under this subpart.
