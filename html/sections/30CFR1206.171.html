Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. Transportation allowance

An area may be all lands within the boundaries of an Indian reservation.</p><p class="depth0">Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. The following percentages (based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership) determine if persons are affiliated:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which ONRR may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. ONRR may require the lessee to certify the percentage of ownership or control of the entity. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as well as when the contract was executed.</p><p class="depth2">Audit means a review, conducted under generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other persons who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.</p><p class="depth2">BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2">Compression means raising the pressure of gas.</p><p class="depth2">Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to processing.

Drip condensate includes condensate recovered as a result of its becoming a liquid during the transportation of the gas removed from the lease or recovered at the inlet of a gas processing plant by mechanical means, often referred to as scrubber condensate.</p><p class="depth2">Dual Accounting (or accounting for comparison) refers to the requirement to pay royalty based on a value which is the higher of the value of gas prior to processing less any applicable allowances as compared to the combined value of drip condensate, residue gas, and gas plant products after processing, less applicable allowances.</p><p class="depth2">Entitlement (or entitled share) means the gas production from a lease, or allocable to lease acreage under the terms of an AFA, multiplied by the operating rights owner's percentage of interest ownership in the lease or the acreage.</p><p class="depth2">Facility measurement point (or point of royalty settlement) means the point where the BLM-approved measurement device is located for determining the

volume of gas removed from the lease. The facility measurement point may be on the lease or off-lease with BLM approval.</p><p class="depth2">Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located.</p><p class="depth2">Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth2">Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas. However, it does not include residue gas.</p><p class="depth2">Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized area; or a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel.</p><p class="depth2">Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the disposition of unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as compression, dehydration, measurement, or field gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor, and payments for gas processing rights. Gross proceeds, as applied to gas, also includes but is not limited to reimbursements for severance taxes and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest is exempt from taxation.
