                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(5)(A)(i)(I))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em> and  (c)(1) of this section are in addition to the common rule requirements.  Also, paragraphs included in the common rule which relate to the use of  donated buildings and other real property as match have been excluded  from this provision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only costs that would be allowable if paid for with WtW grant  funds will be accepted as match.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Because the use of Federal funds is prohibited for construction  or purchase of facilities or buildings except where there is explicit  statutory authority permitting it, costs incurred for the construction  or purchase of facilities or buildings shall not be acceptable as match  for a WtW grant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Because the costs of construction or purchase of facilities or  buildings are unallowable as match, the donation of a building or  property as a third party in-kind contribution is also unallowable as a  match for a WtW grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A match or cost-sharing requirement may be satisfied by either  or both of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost  type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable  cost borne by non-Federal grants or by others and cash donations from  non-Federal third parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to  the FY period to which the cost-sharing or matching requirement applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the total match  expenditures may be in the form of third party in-kind contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Match expenditures must be recorded in the books of account of  the entity that incurred the cost or received the contribution. These  amounts may be rolled up and reported as aggregate State level match.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualifications and exceptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The matching requirements may not be met by the use of an  employer's share of participant wage payments (e.g., employer share of  OJT wages).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements. A cost-sharing or  matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal  grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or  subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section,  general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not  considered Federal grant funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost-sharing  requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind  contributions may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching  requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted  towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of another  Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other  award of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program  income, as defined in 29 CFR 97.25, shall not count towards satisfying a  cost-sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted  in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program  income is described in 29 CFR 97.25(g)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Services or property financed by income earned by contractors.  Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried  out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party  awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by  this income may count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching  requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly  permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting  towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement must be  verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type  contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party  in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer  services will be supported by the same methods that the organization  uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost- sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the  contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable  costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services  that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the  contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an  indirect costs. Cost sharing or matching credit for such contributions  shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has  established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate  for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the  contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract  may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement only  if it results in:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An increase in the services or property provided under the  contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for  cost-sharing or matching purposes must conform to the rules in the  succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution  is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it must  be fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Valuation of donated services--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Volunteer services. Unpaid  services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals must be  valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for   similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the  grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work,  the rates must be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other  employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a  reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a  grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge  the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the  services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive  of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services  are in a different line of work, paragraph (d)(1) of this section  applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment  or space. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a third party donates supplies, the contribution must  be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a  building but retains title, the contribution must be valued at:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> the fair rental rate of the equipment or space for property  donated by non-governmental entities, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> a depreciation or use-allowance based on the property's market  value at the time it was donated for property donated by governmental  entities.</p>
