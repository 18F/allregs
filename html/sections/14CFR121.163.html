                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial airplane proving tests. No person may operate an  airplane not before proven for use in a kind of operation under this  part or part 135 of this chapter unless an airplane of that type has  had, in addition to the airplane certification tests, at least 100 hours  of proving tests acceptable to the Administrator, including a  representative number of flights into en route airports. The requirement  for at least 100 hours of proving tests may be reduced by the  Administrator if the Administrator determines that a satisfactory level  of proficiency has been demonstrated to justify the reduction. At least  10 hours of proving flights must be flown at night; these tests are  irreducible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proving tests for kinds of operations. Unless otherwise  authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane, a  certificate holder must conduct at least 50 hours of proving tests  acceptable to the Administrator for each kind of operation it intends to  conduct, including a representative number of flights into en route  airports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proving tests for materially altered airplanes. Unless otherwise  authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane that is  materially altered in design, a certificate holder must conduct at least  50 hours of proving tests acceptable to the Administrator for each kind  of operation it intends to conduct with that airplane, including a  representative number of flights into en route airports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition of materially altered. For the purposes of paragraph  (c) of this section, a type of airplane is considered to be materially  altered in design if the alteration includes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The installation of powerplants other than those of a type  similar to those with which it is certificated; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alterations to the aircraft or its components that materially  affect flight characteristics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No certificate holder may carry passengers in an aircraft during  proving tests, except for those needed to make the test and those  designated by the Administrator. However, it may carry mail, express, or  other cargo, when approved.  [Doc.
