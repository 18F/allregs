The test headforms shall comply with the dimensions of the full chin ISO reference headforms sizes A, E, J, M, and O.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test fixture. The headform shall be secured in a test fixture with the headform's vertical axis pointing downward and 45 degrees to the direction of gravity (see Figure 7 of this part). The test fixture shall permit rotation of the headform about its vertical axis and include means to lock the headform in the face up and face down positions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dynamic impact apparatus. A dynamic impact apparatus shall be used to apply a shock load to a helmet secured to the test headform. The dynamic impact apparatus shall allow a 4-kg (8.8-lb) drop weight to slide in a guided free fall to impact a rigid stop anvil (see Figure 7 of this part). The entire mass of the dynamic impact assembly, including the drop weight, shall be no more than 5 kg (11 lb).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Strap or cable. A hook and flexible strap or cable shall be used to connect the dynamic impact apparatus to the

helmet. The strap or cable shall be of a material having an elongation of no more than 5 mm (0.20 in.) per 300 mm (11.8 in.) when loaded with a 22-kg (48.5 lb) weight in a free hanging position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure.
