                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial scoping speciation to identify fluorinated GHGs. You  must conduct an initial scoping speciation to identify all fluorinated  GHGs that may be generated from processes that are subject to this  subpart and that have at least one process vent with uncontrolled  emissions of 1.0 metric ton or more of fluorinated GHGs per year based  on the preliminary estimate of emissions in Sec. 98.123(c)(1). You are  not required to quantify emissions under this initial scoping  speciation. Only fluorinated GHG products and by-products that occur in  greater than trace concentrations in at least one stream must be  identified under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. To conduct the scoping speciation, select the  stream(s) (including process streams or destroyed streams) or process  vent(s) that would be expected to individually or collectively contain  all of the fluorinated GHG by-products of the process at their maximum  concentrations and sample and analyze the contents of these selected  streams or process vents. For example, if fluorinated GHG by-products  are separated into one low-boiling-point and one high-boiling-point  stream, sample and analyze both of these streams. Alternatively, you may  sample and analyze streams where fluorinated GHG by-products occur at  less than their maximum concentrations, but you must ensure that the  sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to compensate for the expected  difference in concentration. For example, if you sample and analyze  streams where fluorinated GHG by-products are expected to occur at one  half their maximum concentrations elsewhere in the process, you must  ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to detect  fluorinated GHG by-products that occur at concentrations of 0.05 percent  or higher. You do not have to sample and analyze every stream or process  vent, i.e., you do not have to sample and analyze a stream or process  vent that contains only fluorinated GHGs that are contained in other  streams or process vents that are being sampled and analyzed. Sampling  and analysis must be conducted according to the procedures in paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Previous measurements. If you have conducted testing of streams  (including process streams or destroyed streams) or process vents less  than 10 years before December 31, 2010, and the testing meets the  requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you may use the  previous testing to satisfy this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mass balance monitoring. Mass balance monitoring was available  for reporting years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 only. See paragraph 2 of  Appendix A of this subpart for the former mass balance method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(8)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Process vent testing. Conduct an emissions test that is based on  representative performance of the process or operating scenario(s) of  the process, as applicable. For process vents for which you performed an  initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated  GHG that was identified in the initial scoping speciation. For process  vents for which you did not perform an initial scoping speciation,  include in the emission test any   fluorinated greenhouse gas that occurs in more than trace concentrations  in the vent stream or, where a destruction device is used, in the inlet  to the destruction device. You may include startup and shutdown events  if the testing is sufficiently long or comprehensive to ensure that such  events are not overrepresented in the emission factor. Malfunction  events must not be included in the testing. If you do not detect a  fluorinated GHG that was identified in the scoping speciation or that  occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or in the  inlet to the destruction device, assume that fluorinated GHG was emitted  at one half of the detection limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Number of runs. For continuous processes, sample the process  vent for a minimum of three runs of 1 hour each. If the relative  standard deviation (RSD) of the emission factor calculated based on the  first three runs is greater than or equal to 0.15 for the emission  factor, continue to sample the process vent for an additional three runs  of 1 hour each. If more than one fluorinated GHG is measured, the RSD  must be expressed in terms of total CO2e.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Process activity measurements. Determine the mass rate of  process feed, process production, or other process activity as  applicable during the test using flow meters, weigh scales, or other  measurement devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision of  1 percent of full scale or better. These devices  may be the same plant instruments or procedures that are used for  accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders,  combination of volume measurements and bulk density, etc.) if these  devices or procedures meet the requirement. For monitoring ongoing  process activity, use flow meters, weigh scales, or other measurement  devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision of 1 percent of full scale or better.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(iii)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may sample emissions from each process in the ducts before  the emissions are combined.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may sample in the common duct or at the outlet of the  destruction device when only one process is operating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may sample the combined emissions and use engineering  calculations and assessments as specified in Sec. 98.123(c)(4) to  allocate the emissions to each manifolded process vent, provided the sum  of the calculated fluorinated GHG emissions across the individual  process vents is within 20 percent of the total fluorinated GHG  emissions measured during the manifolded testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Emission test results. The results of an emission test must  include the analysis of samples, number of test runs, the results of the  RSD analysis, the analytical method used, determination of emissions,  the process activity, and raw data and must identify the process, the  operating scenario, the process vents tested, and the fluorinated GHGs  that were included in the test. The emissions test report must contain  all information and data used to derive the process-vent-specific  emission factor, as well as key process conditions during the test. Key  process conditions include those that are normally monitored for process  control purposes and may include but are not limited to yields,  pressures, temperatures, etc. (e.g., of reactor vessels, distillation  columns).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Emissions testing frequency. You must conduct emissions testing  to develop the process-vent-specific emission factor under paragraph  (c)(7)(i) or (c)(7)(ii) of this section, whichever occurs first:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 10-year revision. Conduct an emissions test every 10 years. In  the calculations under Sec. 98.123, apply the revised process-vent- specific emission factor to the process activity that occurs after the  revision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operating scenario change that affects the emission factor. For  planned operating scenario changes, you must estimate and compare the  emission calculation factors for the changed operating scenario and for  the original operating scenario whose process vent specific emission  factor was measured. Use the calculation methods in Sec. 98.123(c)(4).  If the emission calculation   factor for the changed operating scenario is 15 percent or more  different from the emission calculation factor for the previous  operating scenario (this includes the cumulative change in the emission  calculation factor since the last emissions test), you must conduct an  emissions test to update the process-vent-specific emission factor,  unless the difference between the operating scenarios is solely due to  the application of a destruction device to emissions under the changed  operating scenario. Conduct the test before February 28 of the year that  immediately follows the change. In the calculations under Sec. 98.123,  apply the revised process-vent-specific emission factor to the process  activity that occurs after the operating scenario change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Subsequent measurements. If a continuous process vent with  fluorinated GHG emissions less than 10,000 metric tons CO2e,  per Sec. 98.123(c)(2), is later found to have fluorinated GHG emissions  of 10,000 metric tons CO2e or greater, you must conduct the  emissions testing for the process vent during the following year and  develop the process-vent-specific emission factor from the emissions  testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> of this  section, you may use the previous emissions testing to develop process- vent-specific emission factors. For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of  this section, the date of the previous emissions test rather than  December 31, 2010 shall constitute the beginning of the 10-year re- measurement cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operating scenario. Perform the emissions calculation for the  process vent based on representative performance of the operating  scenario of the process. If more than one operating scenario applies to  the process that contains the subject process vent, you must conduct a  separate emissions calculation for operation under each operating  scenario. For each continuous process vent that contains more than trace  concentrations of any fluorinated GHG and for each batch process vent  that contains more than trace concentrations of any fluorinated GHG,  develop the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor for each  operating scenario. For continuous process vents, determine the  emissions based on the process activity for the representative  performance of the operating scenario. For batch process vents,  determine emissions based on the process activity for each typical batch  operating scenario.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Process activity measurements. Use flow meters, weigh scales, or  other measurement devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision  of 1 percent of full scale or better for  monitoring ongoing process activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission calculation results. The emission calculation must be  documented by identifying the process, the operating scenario, and the  process vents. The documentation must contain the information and data  used to calculate the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Operating scenario change that affects the emission calculation  factor. For planned operating scenario changes that are expected to  change the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor, you must  conduct an emissions calculation to update the process-vent-specific  emission calculation factor. In the calculations under Sec. 98.123,  apply the revised emission calculation factor to the process activity  that occurs after the operating scenario change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Previous calculations. If you have performed an emissions  calculation for the process vent and operating scenario less than 10  years before December 31, 2010, and the emissions calculation meets the  requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section and in  Sec. 98.123(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii), you may use the previous  calculation to develop the site-specific process-vent-specific emission  calculation factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emission and stream testing, including analytical methods.  Select and document testing and analytical methods as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sampling and mass measurement for emission testing. For emission  testing in process vents or at the stack, use methods for sampling,  measuring volumetric flow rates, non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis, and  measuring stack gas moisture that have been validated using a  scientifically sound validation protocol.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sample and velocity traverses. Acceptable methods include but  are not limited to EPA Method 1 or 1A in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Velocity and volumetric flow rates. Acceptable methods include  but are not limited to EPA Method 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G in  Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60. Alternatives that may be used for  determining flow rates include OTM-24 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 98.7) and ALT-012 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis. Acceptable methods include  but are not limited to EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR  part 60.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Stack gas moisture. Acceptable methods include but are not  limited to EPA Method 4 in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Analytical methods. Use a quality-assured analytical measurement  technology capable of detecting the analyte of interest at the  concentration of interest and use a sampling and analytical procedure  validated with the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest.  Where calibration standards for the analyte are not available, a  chemically similar surrogate may be used. Acceptable analytical  measurement technologies include but are not limited to gas  chromatography (GC) with an appropriate detector, infrared (IR), fourier  transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  Acceptable methods for determining fluorinated GHGs include EPA Method  18 in appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60, EPA Method 320 in appendix A of 40  CFR part 63, EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  98.7), ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7), or  other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 301 at 40 CFR part  63, appendix A or some other scientifically sound validation protocol.  Acceptable methods for determining total fluorine concentrations for  fluorine-containing compounds in streams under paragraph (b)(3) of this  section include ASTM D7359-08 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  98.7), or other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 301 at 40  CFR part 63, appendix A or some other scientifically sound validation  protocol. The validation protocol may include analytical technology  manufacturer specifications or recommendations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation in GHG Monitoring Plan. Describe the sampling,  measurement, and analytical method(s) used under paragraphs (e)(1) and  (e)(2) of this section in the GHG Monitoring Plan as required under  Sec. 98.3(g)(5). Identify the methods used to obtain the samples and  measurements listed under paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) of  this section. At a minimum, include in the description of the analytical  method a description of the analytical measurement equipment and  procedures, quantitative estimates of the method's accuracy and  precision for the analytes of interest at the concentrations of  interest, as well as a description of how these accuracies and  precisions were estimated, including the validation protocol used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Site-specific leak monitoring approach. You may develop a site- specific leak monitoring approach. You must validate the leak monitoring  method and describe the method and the validation in the GHG Monitoring  Plan. To validate the site-specific method, you may, for example,  release a known rate of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest,  or you may compare the results of the site-specific method to those of a  method that has been validated for the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of  interest. In the description of the leak detection method and its  validation, include a detailed description of the method, including the  procedures and equipment used and any sampling strategies. Also include  the   rationale behind the method, including why the method is expected to  result in an unbiased estimate of emissions from equipment leaks. If the  method is based on methods that are used to detect or quantify leaks or  other emissions in other regulations, standards, or guidelines, identify  and describe the regulations, standards, or guidelines and why their  methods are applicable to emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates  from leaks. Account for possible sources of error in the method, e.g.,  instrument detection limits, measurement biases, and sampling biases.  Describe validation efforts, including but not limited to any  comparisons against standard leaks or concentrations, any comparisons  against other methods, and their results. If you use the Screening  Ranges Approach, the EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific  Correlation Approach with a monitoring instrument that does not meet all  of the specifications in EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7,  then explain how and why the monitoring instrument, as used at your  facility, would nevertheless be expected to accurately detect and  quantify emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from process  equipment, and describe how you verified its accuracy. For all methods,  provide a quantitative estimate of the accuracy and precision of the  method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA Method 21 monitoring. If you determine that EPA Method 21 at  40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated  GHG, conduct the screening value concentration measurements using EPA  Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to determine the screening  range data or the actual screening value data for the Screening Ranges  Approach, EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific Correlation  Approach. For the one-time testing to develop the Unit-Specific  Correlation equations in EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 98.7), conduct the screening value concentration measurements  using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 and the bagging  procedures to measure mass emissions. Concentration measurements of  bagged samples must be conducted using gas chromatography following EPA  Method 18 analytical procedures or other method according to Sec.  98.124(e). Use methane or other appropriate compound as the calibration  gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Frequency of measurement and sampling. If you estimate emissions  based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually.  Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment  that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy  liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual  mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no  external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an  upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or  closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed  through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the  sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in  the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a  sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is  representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple  processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and  that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical  composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures  and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in  one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in  each process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Destruction device performance testing. If you vent or otherwise  feed fluorinated GHGs into a destruction device and apply the  destruction efficiency of the device to one or more fluorinated GHGs in  Sec. 98.123, you must conduct emissions testing to determine the  destruction efficiency for each fluorinated GHG to which you apply the  destruction efficiency. You must either determine the destruction  efficiency for the most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG fed into  the device (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy) and  apply that destruction efficiency to all the fluorinated GHGs   fed into the device or alternatively determine different destruction  efficiencies for different groups of fluorinated GHGs using the most- difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG of each group (or a surrogate that  is still more difficult to destroy).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Destruction efficiency testing. You must sample the inlet and  outlet of the destruction device for a minimum of three runs of 1 hour  each to determine the destruction efficiency. You must conduct the  emissions testing using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section. To  determine the destruction efficiency, emission testing must be conducted  when operating at high loads reasonably expected to occur (i.e.,  representative of high total fluorinated GHG load that will be sent to  the device) and when destroying the most-difficult-to-destroy  fluorinated GHG (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy)  that is fed into the device from the processes subject to this subpart  or that belongs to the group of fluorinated GHGs for which you wish to  establish a DE. If the outlet concentration of a fluorinated GHG that is  fed into the device is below the detection limit of the method, you may  use a concentration of one-half the detection limit to estimate the  destruction efficiency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If perfluoromethane (CF4) is vented to the  destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you  must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved specifically  for CF4 to take credit for the CF4 emissions  reduction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is vented to the  destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you  must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved specifically  for SF6, or alternatively for CF4 as a surrogate,  to take credit for the SF6 emissions reduction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If saturated perfluorocarbons other than CF4 are  vented to the destruction device in any stream in more than trace  concentrations, you must test and determine the destruction efficiency  achieved for the lowest molecular weight saturated perfluorocarbon  vented to the destruction device, or alternatively for a lower molecular  weight saturated PFC or SF6 as a surrogate, to take credit  for the PFC emission reduction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For all other fluorinated GHGs that are vented to the  destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you  must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved for the  most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG or surrogate vented to the  destruction device. Examples of acceptable surrogates include the Class  1 compounds (ranked 1 through 34) in Appendix D, Table D-1 of ``Guidance  on Setting Permit Conditions and Reporting Trial Burn Results; Volume II  of the Hazardous Waste Incineration Guidance Series,'' January 1989, EPA  Publication EPA 625/6-89/019. You can obtain a copy of this publication  by contacting the Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania  Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 272-0167, http://www.epa.gov.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, whichever occurs first:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct an emissions test every 10 years. In the calculations  under Sec. 98.123, apply the updated destruction efficiency to the  destruction that occurs after the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Destruction device changes that affect the destruction  efficiency. If you make a change to the destruction device that would be  expected to affect the destruction efficiency, you must conduct an  emissions test to update the destruction efficiency. Conduct the test  before the February 28 of the year that immediately follows the change.  In the calculations under Sec. 98.123, apply the updated destruction  efficiency to the destruction that occurs after the change to the  device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Previous testing .If you have conducted an emissions test within  the 10 years prior to December 31, 2010, and the emissions testing meets  the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, you may use the  destruction efficiency determined during this previous emissions  testing. For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the date  of the previous emissions test rather than December 31, 2010 shall   constitute the beginning of the 10-year re-measurement cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hazardous Waste Combustor testing. If a destruction device used  to destroy fluorinated GHG is subject to subpart EEE of part 63 of this  chapter or any portion of parts 260-270 of this chapter, you may apply  the destruction efficiency specifically determined for CF4,  SF6, PFCs other than CF4, and all other  fluorinated GHGs under that test if the testing meets the criteria in  paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iv) of this section. If the testing  of the destruction efficiency under subpart EEE of part 63 of this  chapter was conducted more than 10 years ago, you may use the most  recent destruction efficiency test provided that the design, operation,  or maintenance of the destruction device has not changed since the last  destruction efficiency test in a manner that could affect the ability to  achieve the destruction efficiency, and the hazardous waste is fed into  the normal flame zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Mass of previously produced fluorinated GHGs fed into  destruction device. You must measure the mass of each fluorinated GHG  that is fed into the destruction device in more than trace  concentrations and that was previously produced as defined at Sec.  98.410(b). Such fluorinated GHGs include but are not limited to  quantities that are shipped to the facility by another facility for  destruction and quantities that are returned to the facility for  reclamation but are found to be irretrievably contaminated and are  therefore destroyed. You must use flowmeters, weigh scales, or a  combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and  precision of 1 percent of full scale or better. If  the measured mass includes more than trace concentrations of materials  other than the fluorinated GHG being destroyed, you must measure the  concentration of the fluorinated GHG being destroyed. You must multiply  this concentration (mass fraction) by the mass measurement to obtain the  mass of the fluorinated GHG fed into the destruction device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Emissions due to malfunctions of destruction device. In their  estimates of the mass of fluorinated GHG destroyed, fluorinated gas  production facilities that destroy fluorinated GHGs must account for any  temporary reductions in the destruction efficiency that result from any  malfunctions of the destruction device, including periods of operation  outside of the operating conditions defined in operating permit  requirements and/or destruction device manufacturer specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Emissions due to process startup, shutdown, or malfunctions.  Fluorinated GHG production facilities must account for fluorinated GHG  emissions that occur as a result of startups, shutdowns, and  malfunctions, either recording fluorinated GHG emissions during these  events, or documenting that these events do not result in significant  fluorinated GHG emissions. Facilities may use the calculation methods in  Sec. 98.123(c)(1) to estimate emissions during startups, shutdowns, and  malfunctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers.  Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the  facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature  measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in  cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container.  Scales must have an accuracy and precision of 1  percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers  of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For  example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that  contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115  pounds, this equates to 1 percent of 230 pounds,  or 2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers  used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must  have an accuracy and precision of 1 percent of  full scale or better.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Initial scoping speciations, emissions testing, emission factor  development, emission calculation factor development, emission  characterization development, and destruction efficiency determinations  must be completed by February 29, 2012 for processes and operating  scenarios that operate between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.  For other processes and operating scenarios, initial scoping   speciations, emissions testing, emission factor development, emission  calculation factor development, emission characterization development,  and destruction efficiency determinations must be complete by February  28 of the year following the year in which the process or operating  scenario commences or recommences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Calibrate all flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations of  volumetric and density measures using monitoring instruments traceable  to the International System of Units (SI) through the National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other recognized national  measurement institute.

To estimate emissions that  occur from January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011, owners or operators  may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter that cannot  reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC  requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator must use the  calculation methodologies and equations in Sec. 98.123, but may use the  best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not  reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate a required piece of  monitoring equipment, to procure measurement services from necessary  providers, or to gain physical access to make required measurements in a  facility by January 1, 2011. Starting no later than July 1, 2011, the  owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and  begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this  part, except as provided in paragraphs (o)(2) through (o)(4) of this  section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following  methods specified in this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not  meet the specifications of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Supplier data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engineering calculations or assessments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other company records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring  methods to estimate 2011 emissions: parameters other than scoping  speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations.
