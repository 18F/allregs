However, in no case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each pump must be capable of delivering water simultaneously from the outlets having the greatest pressure drop from the five pumps to the nozzles which may not always be the two highest outlets, at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. Where 1\1/2\-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2\1/2\-inch hose by footnote 2 of Table 193.10-5(a), the pump capacity shall be determined on the same basis as if 2\1/2\-inch hose had been permitted.

Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, operating under shutoff conditions, are not capable of developing a pressure exceeding this amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fire pumps shall be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge side of the pumps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at all times. In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be so arranged that adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The total area of the pipes leading from a pump shall not be less than the discharge area of the pump.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> On vessels with main or auxiliary oil fired boilers or vessels with internal combustion propulsion machinery, when two fire pumps are required, the boilers or machinery must be located in separate spaces, and the arrangement, pumps, sea connections, and sources of power must be such as to ensure that a fire in any one space will

not put all of the fire pumps out of operation. However, when it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this requirement due to the size or arrangement of the vessel, or for other reasons, the installation of a total flooding system using carbon dioxide or a clean agent complying with 46 CFR subpart 95.16 may be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire that could affect the powering and operation for the required fire pumps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided for in Sec. 193.10-10(e), a sufficient number of hose streams for fire fighting purposes must be immediately available from the fire main at all times by either of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance of water pressure.

(35 p.s.i. for \3/4\-inch hose); or,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A pressure tank capable of supplying one hose stream at a Pitot tube pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (35 p.s.i. for \3/4\-inch hose) for five minutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An audible alarm must be installed to sound in a continuously manned space if the pressure in the fire main drops to less than that necessary to maintain the minimum Pitot tube pressures specified in Sec. 193.10-5(i)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remote control of fire pumps.
