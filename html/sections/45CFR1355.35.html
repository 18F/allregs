                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory program improvement plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title IV-E agencies  found not to be operating in substantial conformity shall develop a  program improvement plan. The program improvement plan must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be developed jointly by title IV-E agency and Federal staff in  consultation with the review team;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the areas in which the title IV-E agency's program is  not in substantial conformity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>Set forth the goals, the action steps required to correct each  identified weakness or deficiency, and dates by which each action step  is to be completed in order to improve the specific areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Set forth the amount of progress the statewide/Tribal data will  make toward meeting the national standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Establish benchmarks that will be used to measure the title IV-E  agency's progress in implementing the program improvement plan and  describe the methods that will be used to evaluate progress;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Identify how the action steps in the plan build on and make  progress over prior program improvement plans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Identify the technical assistance needs and sources of  technical assistance, both Federal and non-Federal, which will be used  to make the necessary improvements identified in the program improvement  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that ACF and the title IV-E agency cannot reach  consensus regarding the content of a program improvement plan or the  degree of program or data improvement to be achieved, ACF retains the  final authority to assign the contents of the plan and/or the degree of  improvement required for successful completion of the plan. Under such  circumstances, ACF will render a written rationale for assigning such  content or degree of improvement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary program improvement plan. Title IV-E agencies found to  be operating in substantial conformity may voluntarily develop and  implement a program improvement plan in collaboration with the ACF  Regional Office, under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The title IV-E agency and Regional Office agree that there are  areas of the title IV-E agency's child and family services programs in  need of improvement which can be addressed through the development and  implementation of a voluntary program improvement plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ACF approval of the voluntary program improvement plan will not  be required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No penalty will be assessed for the title IV-E agency's failure  to achieve   the goals described in the voluntary program improvement plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of program improvement plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A title IV-E agency  determined not to be in substantial conformity must submit a program  improvement plan to ACF for approval within 90 calendar days from the  date the title IV-E agency receives the written notification from ACF  that it is not operating in substantial conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any program improvement plan will be approved by ACF if it meets  the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the program improvement plan does not meet the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section, the title IV-E agency will have 30  calendar days from the date it receives notice from ACF that the plan  has not been approved to revise and resubmit the plan for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the title IV-E agency does not submit a revised program  improvement plan according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this  section or if the plan does not meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of  this section, withholding of funds pursuant to the provisions of Sec.  1355.36 of this part will begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration of program improvement plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ACF retains the  authority to establish time frames for the program improvement plan  consistent with the seriousness and complexity of the remedies required  for any areas determined not in substantial conformity, not to exceed  two years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particularly egregious areas of nonconformity impacting child  safety must receive priority in both the content and time frames of the  program improvement plans and must be addressed in less than two years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary may approve extensions of deadlines in a program  improvement plan not to exceed one year. The circumstances under which  requests for extensions will be approved are expected to be rare. The  title IV-E agency must provide compelling documentation of the need for  such an extension. Requests for extensions must be received by ACF at  least 60 days prior to the affected completion date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Title IV-E agencies must provide quarterly status reports  (unless ACF and the title IV-E agency agree to less frequent reports) to  ACF. Such reports must inform ACF of progress in implementing the  measures of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evaluating program improvement plans. Program improvement plans  will be evaluated jointly by the title IV-E agency and ACF, in  collaboration with other members of the review team, as described in the  title IV-E agency's program improvement plan and in accordance with the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The methods and information used to measure progress must be  sufficient to determine when and whether the title IV-E agency is  operating in substantial conformity or has reached the negotiated  standard with respect to statewide/Tribal service area data indicators  that failed to meet the national standard for that indicator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The frequency of evaluating progress will be determined jointly  by the title IV-E agency and Federal team members, but no less than  annually. Evaluation of progress will be performed in conjunction with  the annual updates of the title IV-E agency's CFSP, as described in  paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Action steps may be jointly determined by the title IV-E agency  and ACF to be achieved prior to projected completion dates, and will not  require any further evaluation at a later date; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The title IV-E agency and ACF may jointly renegotiate the terms  and conditions of the program improvement plan as needed, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The renegotiated plan is designed to correct the areas of the  title IV-E agency's program determined not to be in substantial  conformity and/or achieve a standard for the statewide/Tribal service  area data indicators that is acceptable to ACF;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of time needed to implement the provisions of the  plan does not extend beyond three years from the date the original  program improvement plan was approved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The terms of the renegotiated plan are approved by ACF; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Secretary approves any extensions beyond the two-year  limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Integration of program improvement plans with CFSP planning. The  elements of the program improvement plan must   be incorporated into the goals and objectives of the title IV-E agency's  CFSP. Progress in implementing the program improvement plan must be  included in the annual reviews and progress reports related to the CFSP  required in 45 CFR 1357.16.   (This requirement has been approved by the Office of Management and  Budget under OMB Control Number 0970-0214. In accordance with the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor,  and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information  unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.)
