Exception: If the position is  excluded by regulation (not by law), and the employee does not have a  break in service of more than three days, the Basic insurance continues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 870.701, the Basic insurance of  an insured employee who is in nonpay status stops on the date the  employee completes 12 months in nonpay status, subject to a 31-day  extension of coverage. The 12   months' nonpay status may be broken by periods of less than 4  consecutive months in pay status. If an employee has at least 4  consecutive months in pay status after a period of nonpay status, he or  she is entitled to begin the 12 months' continuation of Basic insurance  again.
