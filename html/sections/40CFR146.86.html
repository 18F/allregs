                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The owner or operator must ensure that all Class VI  wells are constructed and completed to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prevent the movement of fluids into or between USDWs or into any  unauthorized zones;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit the use of appropriate testing devices and workover  tools; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permit continuous monitoring of the annulus space between the  injection tubing and long string casing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Casing and cementing of Class VI wells. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Casing and cement or  other materials used in the construction of each Class VI well must have  sufficient structural strength and be designed for the life of the  geologic sequestration project. All well materials must be compatible  with fluids with which the materials may be expected to come into  contact and must meet or exceed standards developed for such materials  by the American Petroleum Institute, ASTM International, or comparable  standards acceptable to the Director. The casing and cementing program  must be designed to prevent the movement of fluids into or between  USDWs. In order to allow the Director to determine and specify casing  and cementing requirements, the owner or operator   must provide the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Depth to the injection zone(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Injection pressure, external pressure, internal pressure, and  axial loading;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Hole size;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Size and grade of all casing strings (wall thickness, external  diameter, nominal weight, length, joint specification, and construction  material);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Corrosiveness of the carbon dioxide stream and formation fluids;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Down-hole temperatures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Lithology of injection and confining zone(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Type or grade of cement and cement additives; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Quantity, chemical composition, and temperature of the carbon  dioxide stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface casing must extend through the base of the lowermost  USDW and be cemented to the surface through the use of a single or  multiple strings of casing and cement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least one long string casing, using a sufficient number of  centralizers, must extend to the injection zone and must be cemented by  circulating cement to the surface in one or more stages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Circulation of cement may be accomplished by staging. The  Director may approve an alternative method of cementing in cases where  the cement cannot be recirculated to the surface, provided the owner or  operator can demonstrate by using logs that the cement does not allow  fluid movement behind the well bore.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cement and cement additives must be compatible with the carbon  dioxide stream and formation fluids and of sufficient quality and  quantity to maintain integrity over the design life of the geologic  sequestration project. The integrity and location of the cement shall be  verified using technology capable of evaluating cement quality radially  and identifying the location of channels to ensure that USDWs are not  endangered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tubing and packer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tubing and packer materials used in the  construction of each Class VI well must be compatible with fluids with  which the materials may be expected to come into contact and must meet  or exceed standards developed for such materials by the American  Petroleum Institute, ASTM International, or comparable standards  acceptable to the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All owners or operators of Class VI wells must inject fluids  through tubing with a packer set at a depth opposite a cemented interval  at the location approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order for the Director to determine and specify requirements  for tubing and packer, the owner or operator must submit the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Depth of setting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Characteristics of the carbon dioxide stream (chemical content,  corrosiveness, temperature, and density) and formation fluids;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maximum proposed injection pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Maximum proposed annular pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Proposed injection rate (intermittent or continuous) and volume  and/or mass of the carbon dioxide stream;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Size of tubing and casing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Tubing tensile, burst, and collapse strengths.</p>
