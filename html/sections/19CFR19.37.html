                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b) of this part. The crib may be a permanent  location or a mobile facility which is periodically moved to a location  beyond the exit point. The quantity of goods in the crib may be an  amount requested by the proprietor which is commercially necessary for  the delivery operations for a period, if approved by the port director.  The port director may increase or decrease the quantity as deemed  necessary for the protection of the revenue and proper administration of  U.S. laws and regulations, or may order the return to the storage area  of goods remaining unsold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery and removal of merchandise. Conditionally duty-free  merchandise shall be delivered to the crib, or removed from the crib for  return to the storage area, under the procedures in subpart D, part 125,  and Sec. 144.34(a), of this chapter, or under a local control system  approved by the port director wherein any discrepancy found in the  merchandise will be treated as if it occurred in the bonded warehouse.  If delivery is made by licensed cartman, cartage vehicles shall be  conspicuously marked as provided in Sec. 112.27 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delivery vehicles. Vehicles, including mobile cribs, containing  conditionally duty-free merchandise for delivery to or from a crib shall  carry a listing of the articles contained therein. The proprietor shall  provide, upon request by Customs, a transfer document sufficient to  account for each movement of inventory among its locations. The  merchandise in the vehicles shall be subject to inspection by Customs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of records. Class 9 warehouse proprietors shall  maintain records of conditionally duty-free merchandise transported  beyond the exit point and returned therefrom, and Customs permits for  such movements, for not less than 5 years after exportation of the  articles. Such records need not be placed in permit file folders but  must be filed by date of movement, destination site and warehouse entry  number or by unique identifier where permitted by the port director (see  Sec. 19.36(g)).
