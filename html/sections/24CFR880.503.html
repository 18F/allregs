                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maximum Annual Commitment. Where HUD is the contract administrator, the maximum annual amount that may be committed under the Contract is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project. Where the PHA is the contract administrator, the maximum annual contribution that may be contracted for in the ACC is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units plus an administrative fee for the PHA as approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project Account. (1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the Contract or ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account for housing assistance payments (and fees for PHA administration, if appropriate) when needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant rents and for other cost specifically approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project.
