                            <p class="depth0">CAA Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) requirements for the 1997 8-hour ozone  and PM2.5 standards. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, of  the Utah SIP submitted by the Utah Governor on March 22, 2007, satisfies  the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 8- hour ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS promulgated by EPA in July 1997.  Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, was adopted by the UAQB on February  9, 2007. The March 22, 2007 Governor's letter included as an attachment  a set of replacement pages for the Interstate Transport text. The new  pages reflect correctly that the Interstate Transport declaration is  under Section XXIII of the Utah SIP   and not under Section XXII as incorrectly indicated in the pages  submitted with the Administrative Documentation for the adoption of this  SIP section.
