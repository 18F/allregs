There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any person working in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility is a miner. This presumption may be rebutted by proof that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person was not engaged in the extraction, preparation or transportation of coal while working at the mine site, or in maintenance or construction of the mine site; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual was not regularly employed in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coal mine construction and transportation workers; special provisions. A coal mine construction or transportation worker shall be considered a miner to the extent such individual is or was exposed to coal mine dust as a result of employment in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility. A transportation worker shall be considered a miner to the extent that his or her work is integral to the extraction or preparation of coal. A construction worker shall be considered a miner to the extent that his or her work is integral to the building of a coal or underground mine (see Sec. 725.101(a)(12), (30)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such individual was exposed to coal mine dust during all periods of such employment occurring in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility for purposes of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determining whether such individual is or was a miner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing the applicability of any of the presumptions described in section 411(c) of the Act and part 718 of this subchapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determining the identity of a coal mine operator liable for the payment of benefits in accordance with Sec. 725.495.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The presumption may be rebutted by evidence which demonstrates that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual was not regularly exposed to coal mine dust during his or her work in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual did not work regularly in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A person who is or was a self-employed miner or independent contractor, and who otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph, shall be considered a miner for the purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions of entitlement; miner. An individual is eligible for benefits under this subchapter if the individual:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is a miner as defined in this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has met the requirements for entitlement to benefits by establishing that he or she:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has pneumoconiosis (see Sec. 718.202), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment (see Sec. 718.203), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is totally disabled (see Sec. 718.204(c)), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The pneumoconiosis contributes to the total disability (see Sec. 718.204(c)); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has filed a claim for benefits in accordance with the provisions of this part.</p>
