The agency shall instead permit respondents to prove or satisfy the legal conditions in any other reasonable manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If OMB disapproves the whole of such a collection of information (and the disapproval is not overridden under Sec. 1320.15), the agency shall grant the benefit to (or not impose the penalty on) otherwise qualified persons without requesting further proof concerning the condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If OMB instructs an agency to make a substantive or material change to such a collection of information (and the instruction is not overridden under Sec. 1320.15), the agency shall permit respondents to prove or satisfy the condition by complying with the collection of information as so changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a member of the public is protected from imposition of a penalty under this section for failure to comply with a collection of information, such penalty may not be imposed by an agency directly, by an agency through judicial process, or by any

other person through administrative or judicial process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The protection provided by paragraph (a) of this section does not preclude the imposition of a penalty on a person for failing to comply with a collection of information that is imposed on the person by statute--e.g., 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6011(a) (statutory requirement for person to file a tax return), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 6938(c) (statutory requirement for person to provide notification before exporting hazardous waste).</p>
