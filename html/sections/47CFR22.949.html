Consequently, Unserved Area applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general procedures under Sec. 22.131.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unserved Area applications under this section may propose a CGSA covering more than one CMA.
