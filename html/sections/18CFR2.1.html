[58 FR 38292, July 16, 1993]    Sec. 2.1c  Policy statement on consultation with Indian tribes in  Commission proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Commission recognizes the unique relationship between the  United States and Indian tribes as defined by treaties, statutes, and  judicial decisions. Indian tribes have various sovereign authorities,  including the power to make and enforce laws, administer justice, and  manage and control their lands and resources. Through several Executive  Orders and a Presidential Memorandum, departments and agencies of the  Executive Branch have been urged to consult with federally-recognized  Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the government-to-government  relationship between these agencies and tribes. In essence, this means  that consultation should involve direct contact between agencies and  tribes and should recognize the status of the tribes as governmental  sovereigns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commission acknowledges that, as an independent agency of  the federal government, it has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes  and this historic relationship requires it to adhere to certain  fiduciary standards in its dealings with Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Commission will endeavor to work with Indian tribes on a  government-to-government basis, and will seek to address the effects of  proposed projects on tribal rights and resources through consultation  pursuant to the Commission's trust responsibility, the Federal Power  Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act,  section 32 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, the Interstate  Commerce Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, section 106 of the  National Historic Preservation Act, and in the Commission's  environmental and decisional documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> As an independent regulatory agency, the Commission functions as  a neutral, quasi-judicial body, rendering decisions on applications  filed with it,   and resolving issues among parties appearing before it, including Indian  tribes. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act  and the Commission's rules concerning off-the-record communications, as  well as the nature of the Commission's licensing and certificating  processes and of the Commission's review of jurisdictional rates, terms  and conditions, place some limitations on the nature and type of  consultation that the Commission may engage in with any party in a  contested case. Nevertheless, the Commission will endeavor, to the  extent authorized by law, to reduce procedural impediments to working  directly and effectively with tribal governments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Commission, in keeping with its trust responsibility, will  assure that tribal concerns and interests are considered whenever the  Commission's actions or decisions have the potential to adversely affect  Indian tribes or Indian trust resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Commission will seek to engage tribes in high-level meetings  to discuss general matters of importance, such as those that uniquely  affect the tribes. Where appropriate, these meetings may be arranged for  particular tribes, by region, or in some proceedings involving  hydroelectric projects, by river basins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Commission will strive to develop working relationships with  tribes and will seek to establish procedures to educate Commission staff  about tribal governments and cultures and to educate tribes about the  Commission's various statutory functions and programs. To assist in this  effort, the Commission is establishing the position of tribal liaison.  The tribal liaison will provide a point of contact and a resource for  tribes for any proceeding at the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Concurrently with this policy statement, the Commission is  issuing certain new regulations regarding the licensing of hydroelectric  projects. In this connection, the Commission sets forth the following  additional policies for the hydroelectric licensing process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Commission believes that the hydroelectric licensing process  will benefit by more direct and substantial consultation between the  Commission staff and Indian tribes. Because of the unique status of  Indian tribes in relation to the Federal government, the Commission will  endeavor to increase direct communications with tribal representatives  in appropriate circumstances, recognizing that different issues and  stages of a proceeding may call for different approaches, and there are  some limitations that must be observed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The Commission will seek to notify potentially-affected tribes  about upcoming hydroelectric licensing processes, to discuss the  consultation process and the importance of tribal participation, to  learn more about each tribe's culture, and to establish case-by-case  consultation procedures consistent with our ex parte rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> In evaluating a proposed hydroelectric project, the Commission  will consider any comprehensive plans prepared by Indian tribes or  inter-tribal organizations for improving, developing, or conserving a  waterway or waterways affected by a proposed project. The Commission  will treat as a comprehensive plan, a plan that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is a comprehensive study of one or more of the beneficial uses  of a waterway or waterways;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includes a description of the standards applied, the data relied  upon, and the methodology used in preparing the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.
