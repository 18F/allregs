This part applies to  all contracts and orders for services regardless of the contract type or  kind of service being acquired. This part requires the use of  performance-based acquisitions for services to the maximum extent  practicable and prescribes policies and procedures for use of  performance-based acquisition methods (see Subpart 37.6). Additional  guidance for research and development services is in part 35; architect- engineering services is in part 36; information technology is in part  39; and transportation services is in part 47. Parts 35, 36, 39, and 47  take precedence over this part in the event of inconsistencies. This  part includes, but is not limited to, contracts for services to which 41  U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards, applies (see  subpart 22.10).
