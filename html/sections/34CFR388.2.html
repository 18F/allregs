                            <p class="depth0">Each designated State agency is eligible to receive an award under the basic State award program described in Sec. 388.21. If a designated State agency does not apply for an award during an announced competition, no funds may be made available for in-service training of the staff of that designated State agency under this program until there is a new competition for funding. At least 15 percent of the sums appropriated to carry out section 302 of the Act must be allocated to designated State agencies to be used, directly or indirectly, for projects for in-service training of rehabilitation personnel.
