                            <p class="depth0">The head of the agency, or his or her designee, shall appoint review committees to review adverse determinations made by officials for programs under their jurisdiction. A minimum of three employees shall be appointed (one of whom shall be designated as chairperson) either on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, or as regular members of review committees for such terms as may be designated. None of the members of the review committee reviewing any given appeal may be from the office of the responsible official whose adverse determination is being appealed (e.g., project officer, grants specialist, program manager, grants management officer).
