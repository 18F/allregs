                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-NAFI RIMP claims can arise from the activities of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members of NAFIs or authorized users of NAFI sports equipment or devices for recreational purposes, while

using such property, except real property, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by DA regulations and the charter, constitution, and bylaws of the particular NAF activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Family child care providers, authorized members of the provider's household and approved substitute providers while care under the family child care program is being provided in the manner prescribed in AR 608-10, except as excluded below. Such claims are generally limited to injuries to, or death of, children receiving care under the family child care program that are caused by the negligence of authorized providers. Claims arising from the transportation of such children in motor vehicles and claims involving loss of or damage to property are not cognizable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An ACO or a CPO will ask the Commander USARCS for an advisory opinion prior to settling any non-NAFI RIMP claim where the person whose conduct generated liability does not fall clearly within the categories listed above. Such authorities may also ask, through the Commander USARCS, for an advisory opinion from the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center prior to settling any claim arising under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, where it is not clear that the injured or deceased child was receiving care within the scope of the family child care program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where liability has been determined to exist for both non-NAFI RIMP and APF activities, liability will be apportioned between the two activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The total payment for all claims (including derivative claims), arising as a result of injury to, or death of, any one person is limited to $500,000 for each incident. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or similar harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for purposes of determining the limits of liability.</p>
