                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 60.482-1 through Sec. 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days after initial startup, except that indications of liquids dripping from bleed ports in existing pumps in light liquid service are not considered to be a leak as defined in Sec. 60.482-2(b)(2). For purposes of this standard, a ``bleed port'' is a technologically-required feature of the pump whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible leak of fluid. This exemption expires when the existing pump is replaced or reconstructed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 60.483-1 and Sec. 60.483-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with requirements specified in Sec. 60.484.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions specified in Sec. 60.485 except an owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to Sec. 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 [deg]C (302 [deg]F) as determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 60.17).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with Sec. 60.486 and Sec. 60.487.
