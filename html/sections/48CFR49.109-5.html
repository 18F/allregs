                            <p class="depth0">The TCO should attempt to settle in one agreement all rights and  liabilities of the parties under the contract except those arising from  any continued portion of the contract. Generally, the TCO shall not  attempt to make partial settlements covering particular items of the  prime contractor's settlement proposal. However, when a TCO cannot  promptly complete settlement under the terminated contract, a partial  settlement may be entered into if (a) the issues on which agreement has  been reached are clearly severable from other issues and (b) the partial  settlement will not prejudice the Government's or contractor's interests  in disposing of the unsettled part of the settlement proposal.</p>
