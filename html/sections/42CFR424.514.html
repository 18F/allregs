deny or revoke Medicare billing privileges of a provider or supplier based on noncompliance if, in the absence of a written request for a hardship exception from the application fee that accompanies a Medicare enrollment application, the bank account on which the check that is submitted with the enrollment application is drawn does not contain sufficient funds to pay the application fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information needed for submission of a hardship exception request.
