                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Substitute res. Where property is seized for administrative  forfeiture for a violation involving controlled substances in personal  use quantities, the owner or interested party may offer to post an  amount equal to the appraised value of the property (the res) to obtain  release of the property. The offer, which may be tendered at any time  subsequent to seizure and up until the completion of administrative  forfeiture proceedings, must be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter  of credit, certified funds such as a certified check, traveler's  check(s), or money order made payable to U.S. Customs. Unless the  property is evidence of a violation of law or has other characteristics  that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities, it will be  released to the owner or interested party subsequent to tender of the  substitute res.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forfeiture of res. If a substitute res is posted and it is  determined that the property should be administratively forfeited, the  res will be forfeited in lieu of the property.  [T.D. 89-86, 54 FR 37602, Sept. 11, 1989]</p>
