These may include equity or general fund  contributions to construction, service termination payments, proceeds  from the sale of property, amounts recovered from insurance for losses  during the construction period, and interest received on loan funds in  savings or interest bearing checking accounts, and similar receipts.  Deposit slips for any deposit to the construction fund shall show the  source and amount of funds deposited and be executed by an authorized  representative of the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds shall be disbursed only up to the amount approved for  advance on the FRS as described in Sec. 1744.66. No funds may be  withdrawn from the fund except for loan purposes approved by RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The disbursement of nonloan funds requires the same RUS  approvals as loan funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disbursements must be evidenced by canceled checks. The invoices  and supporting documentation needed for construction contracts are  specified in the contracts and in 7 CFR part 1753. Disbursements to  reimburse the borrower's general funds shall be documented by a  reimbursement schedule, to be retained in the borrower's files, that  lists the construction fund check number, date, and an explanation of  amounts reimbursed by budget account.</p>
