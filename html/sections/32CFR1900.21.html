                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Requests meeting the requirements of Secs. 1900.11  through 1900.13 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under  the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and these regulations.  Upon receipt, the Agency shall within ten (10) days record each request,  acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect  the necessary taskings to the CIA components reasonably believed to hold  responsive records. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day  provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic  Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Database of ``officially released information.'' As an  alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many  requesters, the Agency maintains a database of ``officially released  information'' which contains copies of documents released by this  Agency. Searches of this database, containing currently in excess of  500,000 pages, can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests  that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any,  costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate  in their correspondence. Effective November 1, 1997 and consistent with  the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of  1996, on-the public. Detailed information regarding such access will  line electronic access to these records will be available to be  available at that time from the point of contact specified in  Sec. 1900.03.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(5)</em> of the National Security Act of 1947. In such  circumstances, the Agency, in the form of a final written response,  shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an  administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for response. The Agency will utilize every effort to  determine within the statutory guideline of ten (10) days after receipt  of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However,  the current volume of requests require that the Agency seek additional  time from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such event, the  Agency will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or  her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination.  Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to  twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act  Amendments of 1996.</p>
