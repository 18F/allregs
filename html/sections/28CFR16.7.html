                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential commercial information means  commercial or financial information obtained by the Department from a  submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the  FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person or entity, including a corporation,  State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal  Government entity, that provides information, either directly or  indirectly to the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter  of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to  designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or  within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that  it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These  designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission  unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer  designation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When notice to submitters is required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A component shall  promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential  commercial information whenever records containing such information are  requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive  records, and any appeal by the requester, the component determines that  it may be required to disclose the records, provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requested information has been designated in good faith by  the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under  Exemption 4; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The component has a reason to believe that the requested  information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has  not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure  under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice shall either describe the commercial information  requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of  records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous  number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the  notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice  requirements of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The component determines that the information is exempt under  the FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been lawfully published or has been  officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other  than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the  requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of  this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case,  the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final  decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within  a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A component shall  specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond  to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to  disclosure, it should provide the component a detailed written statement  that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information  under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as  basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information  constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that  is privileged or confidential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A submitter who fails to respond within the time period  specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to  disclosure of the information. Information received by the component  after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the  component. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart  may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Analysis of objections. A component shall consider a submitter's  objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to  disclose the requested information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever a component decides to  disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the component  shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's  disclosure objections was not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time  subsequent to the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit  seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information,  the component shall promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Requester notification. The component shall notify a requester  whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to  object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent  to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a  lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</p>
