                            <p class="depth0">The following policies governing the exercise of its loan guarantee  authority have been established by DOE:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The use of the loan guarantee authority is not restricted to  contracts or   subcontracts of any particular type or class. Each case is to be  evaluated on its own merits and under the particular circumstances  applicable thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fact that a contract has been awarded as a result of  competitive bidding should not, of itself, render the loan ineligible  for guarantee by DOE if the contractor is financially responsible and  its need for working capital is the result of the impact of a defense  program or any other DOE program for which guaranteed loans are  authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The guarantee authority should, in general, not be used in  connection with loans to contractors required to furnish performance  bonds, except in those cases in which the time likely to be required for  the surety or DOE to take over in the event of default will result in  delays which cannot be tolerated by the particular program concerned.  When performance bonds have been furnished, the surety shall be required  to subordinate its rights in favor of the guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The criterion that the materials or services to be provided  cannot readily be acquired from alternative sources does not require the  finding that the materials or services are absolutely unobtainable  elsewhere. The criterion should be so applied as to permit guarantees of  loans when, although the materials or services can be obtained  elsewhere, such factors as the urgency of supply schedules, technical  capacity of the contractor, comparative prices, and time and expense  involved in reissuing the contract, including termination payment,  establish that it is to the Government's advantage not to resort to  alternative sources merely because the contractor or subcontractor may  require a guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If it is known at the time the contract is to be awarded that  the low offeror who is technically qualified and competent to furnish  the required materials and services will require a guaranteed loan, the  contracting officer should obtain appropriate advice and in reaching a  decision should consider at least the following--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The savings to be realized by awarding the contract to the low  offeror;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The risk to the Government in guaranteeing a loan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The likelihood, if award is made to the second low offeror, of  that offeror's applying for a guaranteed loan at a later date.  Extreme care should be exercised in rejecting a low bid or proposal  simply because the low offeror requires a guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The amount of the loan should bear reasonable relationship to  such factors as the value and terms of the contract, the probable  investment required to be made by the contractor in payrolls and  inventories, the frequency with which contract payments are to be made,  and the borrower's current working capital position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Borrowings for working capital purposes under guaranteed loans  shall be limited to the amount necessary to perform the contract for  which the loan is sought. In order that the contractor will also use its  own funds in the performance of the contracts, amounts outstanding under  the loan or line-of-credit shall be limited to an amount not to exceed  90 percent of the borrower's investment in its contracts, regardless of  the total amount of the loan or line of credit authorized. The  borrower's investment includes all items for which the borrower would be  entitled to payment on performance or termination of contracts, but does  not include any items for which no work has been done nor expenditures  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the loan should  mature not later than 30 days after the estimated date of final payment  under the contract.  [49 FR 12011, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9106, Feb. 25, 1994; 74  FR 36367, July 22, 2009]</p>
