                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to establish that a smallpox vaccine recipient or  vaccinia contact sustained a covered injury, a requester must submit the  following medical records:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All physician, clinic, or hospital outpatient medical records  documenting medical visits, consultations, and test results that  occurred on or after the date of the smallpox vaccination or exposure to  vaccinia; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All inpatient hospital medical records, including the admission  history and physical examination, the discharge summary, all physician  subspecialty consultation reports, all progress notes, and all test  results that occurred on or after the date of the smallpox vaccination  or exposure to vaccinia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A requester may submit additional medical documentation that he  or she believes will support the Request Package. Although generally not  required if a Table injury was sustained, a requester may need to  introduce additional medical documentation or scientific evidence in  order to establish that an injury was caused by a covered countermeasure  (including the smallpox vaccine) or vaccinia contracted through  accidental vaccinia inoculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If certain medical records listed in paragraph (a) of this  section are unavailable to the requester after he or she has made  reasonable efforts to obtain the records, the requester must submit a  statement describing the reasons for the records' unavailability and the  efforts he or she has taken to obtain the records. The Secretary has the  discretion to accept such a statement in place of the unavailable  medical records. In this circumstance, the Secretary may require an  authorization   from the requester (or his or her representative) to try to obtain the  records on his or her behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In certain circumstances, the Secretary may require additional  medical records to make a determination that a covered injury was  sustained (e.g., medical records prior to the date of vaccination or  accidental vaccinia exposure) or may determine that certain records  described in paragraph (a) of this section are not necessary for an  eligibility determination (e.g., records that are duplicative of other  records submitted). If the Program requests additional medical records  (or information) from a requester's health care practitioner, then the  requester may use a release form in order to have the medical records  sent directly to the Program.</p>
