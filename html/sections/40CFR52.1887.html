Supplemental information was submitted on March 8, 1983, March 16, 1983, December 5, 1983, and May 9, 1985. The June 9, 1982, and March 8, 1983, submittals also requested that the 5-year extension for meeting the NAAQS requested on July 29, 1979, and granted by USEPA on October 31, 1980, and June 18, 1981, be rescinded for this area. The attainment demonstration and rescission request are disapproved by USEPA because they do not meet the requirements of Sec. 51.10(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval--On October 20, 2005, Ohio submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision of the Cuyahoga County carbon monoxide (CO) maintenance plan. The CO maintenance plan revision is an update to the current approved maintenance plan and continues to demonstrate maintenance of the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for an additional 10 years. The maintenance plan revision is submitted as a limited maintenance plan for the Cuyahoga County, Ohio carbon monoxide area and provides an unlimited motor vehicle emissions budget as long as the ambient CO levels remain below the 7.65 parts per million design value specified as the criterion for the limited maintenance plan.
