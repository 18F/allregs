                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a request for a conference, the official imposing  the sanction shall arrange such a conference with the participant or  contractor and may designate another official to conduct the conference.  The participant shall be given the opportunity to be heard within 10  business days of receipt of the request. This conference precedes, and  is in addition to, the formal hearing provided if an appeal is taken  under Sec. 801.1113. Although formal rules of procedure do not apply to  the conference, the participant or contractor may be represented by  counsel and may present all relevant information and materials to the  official or designee. After consideration of the information and  materials presented, the official shall, in writing, advise the  participant or contractor of the decision to withdraw, modify or affirm  the limited denial of participation. If the decision is made to affirm  all or a portion   of the remaining period of exclusion, the participant shall be advised  of the right to request a formal hearing in writing within 30 days of  receipt of the notice of decision. This decision shall be issued  promptly, but in no event later than 20 days after the conference and  receipt of materials.</p>
