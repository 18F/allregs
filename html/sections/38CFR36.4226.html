                                Sec. 36.4226  Withdrawal of authority to close manufactured home loans
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided in 38 U.S.C. 3702(e), the authority of any lender  to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis may be withdrawn  by the Secretary at any time upon 30 days notice. The automatic  processing authority of both supervised and nonsupervised lenders may be  withdrawn for engaging in practices which are imprudent from a lending  standpoint or which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans or the  Government but are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete  debarment or suspension of the lender from participation in the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Automatic processing authority may be withdrawn for failure to  meet basic qualifying criteria. For non-supervised lenders, this  includes lack of a designated underwriter, failure to maintain $50,000  working capital and/or failure to file required financial statements.  For supervised lenders this includes loss of status as an entity subject  to examination and supervision by a Federal or State supervisory agency  as required by 38 U.S.C. 3702(d). During the 1 year probationary period  for newly approved automatic lenders, automatic authority may be  withdrawn based upon poor underwriting or consistently careless  processing by the lender, as determined by VA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Automatic processing authority may also be withdrawn based on  any of the causes for debarment set forth in 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic  basis may also be temporarily withdrawn for a period of time under the  following schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withdrawal for 60 days:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Automatic loan submissions show deficiencies in credit  underwriting, such as use of unstable sources of income to qualify the  borrower, ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting the  applicant's creditworthiness, etc., after such deficiencies have been  repeatedly called to the lender's attention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employment or deposit verifications are handcarried by  applicants or otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands  of a third party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Automatic loan submissions are consistently incomplete after  such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention  by VA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> There are continued instances of disregard of VA requirements  after they have been called to the lender's attention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withdrawal for 180 days:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Loans are closed automatically which conflict with VA credit  standards and which would not have been made by a lender acting  prudently;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lender fails to disclose to VA significant obligations or  other information so material to the veteran's ability to repay the loan  that undue risk to the Government results;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Employment or deposit verifications are allowed to be  handcarried by applicant or otherwise mishandled, resulting in the  submission of significant misinformation to VA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Substantiated complaints are received that the lender  misrepresented VA requirements to veterans to the detriment of their  interests (e.g., veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest  rate based on lender's incorrect advice that such options were precluded  by VA requirements);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Closing documentation shows instances of improper charges to the  veteran after the impropriety of such charges has been called to the  lender's attention by Va, or refusal to refund   such charges after notification by VA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> There are other instances of lender actions which are  prejudicial to the interests of veterans, such as deliberate delays in  scheduling loan closings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Withdrawal for a period from one year to three years:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lender fails to properly disburse loans (e.g., loan  disbursement checks returned due to insufficient funds); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is involvement by the lender in the improper use of a  veteran's entitlement (e.g., knowingly permitting the veteran to violate  occupancy requirements, lender involvement in sale of veteran's  entitlement).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A continuation of actions that have led to previous withdrawal  of automatic authority justifies withdrawal of automatic authority for  the next longer period of time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Withdrawal of automatic processing authority does not prevent a  lender from processing VA guaranteed manufactured home loans on the  prior approval basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Action by VA to remove a lender's automatic authority does not  prevent VA from also taking debarment or suspension action based on the  same conduct by the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> VA field facilities are authorized to withdraw automatic  privileges for 60 days, based on any of the violations set forth in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, for nonsupervised  lenders without operations in other stations' jurisdictions. All  determinations regarding withdrawal of automatic authority for longer  periods of time or multi-jurisdictional lenders must be made in Central  Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VA will provide 30 days notice of withdrawal of automatic  authority in order to enable the lender to either close or obtain prior  approval for a loan on which processing has begun. There is no right to  a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of automatic processing  privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender  requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit  in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and  argument in opposition to the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the lender's submission in opposition raises a dispute over  facts material to the withdrawal of automatic authority, the lender will  be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit  documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witnesses VA  presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing  officer or panel to conduct the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made available  at cost to the lender, upon request, unless the requirement for a  transcript is waived by mutual agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in  which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under  Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the  information in the administrative record, including any submissions made  by the lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g))</em>.  [56 FR 40560, Aug. 15, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 28058, June 4, 1996; 72  FR 30242, May 31, 2007]</p>
