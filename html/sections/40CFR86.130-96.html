                            <p class="depth0">Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are applicable to  vehicles tested for the FTP test. Paragraph (e) of this section is  applicable to vehicles tested for the SFTP supplemental tests of air  conditioning (SC03) and aggressive driving (US06). Paragraph (f) of this  section is applicable to all emission testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. The test sequence  shown in figure B96-10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle  undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity  with the standards set forth. The full three- diurnal sequence depicted  in figure B96-10 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative   emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is designed to  verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters  during the exhaust emission test. Sections 86.132-96, 86.133-96 and  86.138-96 describe the separate specifications of the supplemental two- diurnal test sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gaseous-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure B96- 10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the  procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the  standards set forth, with the exception that the fuel drain and fill and  precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled  vehicles. In addition, the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running  loss test are not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is  conducted as a stand-alone test (see Sec. 86.146). This test is not  required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle shall  be not less than 68 F nor more than 86 F, unless otherwise specified.  If a different ambient temperature is specified for soaking the vehicle,  the soak period may be interrupted once for up to 10 minutes to  transport the vehicle from one soak area to another, provided the  ambient temperature experienced by the vehicle is never below 68 F. The  temperatures monitored during testing must be representative of those  experienced by the test vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of  the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The supplemental tests for exhaust emissions related to  aggressive driving (US06) and air conditioning (SC03) use are conducted  as stand-alone tests as described in Secs. 86.158 through 86.160. These  tests may be performed in any sequence that maintains the appropriate  preconditioning requirements as specified in Sec. 86.132.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If tests are invalidated after collection of emission data from  previous test segments, the test may be repeated to collect only those  data points needed to complete emission measurements. Compliance with  emission standards may be determined by combining emission measurements  from different test runs. If any emission measurements are repeated, the  new measurements supersede previous values.
