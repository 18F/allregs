                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nonconforming markings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorized markings are identified  in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software  and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings  are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the  form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the  clause at 252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is  not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions-- Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on  computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to  252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To  the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer  software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming  markings to the person who has placed   the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation to provide  that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming  markings at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the  nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within  60 days following the person's receipt of the software or documentation,  the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the  person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software  or computer software documentation for correction, contracting officers  may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government  expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used  in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unjustified markings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An unjustified marking is an  authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions  applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release,  or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software  documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on  computer software developed under a Government contract either  exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations  under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose  rights) is an unjustified marking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the  validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during  performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge,  the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive  marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon  such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election,  either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's  expense; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Return the computer software or computer software documentation  to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's  expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person  fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the  corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60  days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified  marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.</p>
