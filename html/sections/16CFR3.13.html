                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of hearing. When the Commission, acting under Sec.  1.26(g) of this chapter, determines that objections which have been  filed are sufficient to warrant the holding of an adjudicative hearing  in rulemaking proceedings under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, or  when the Commission otherwise determines that the holding of such a  hearing would be in the public interest, a hearing will be held before  an Administrative Law Judge for the purpose of receiving evidence  relevant and material to the issues raised by such objections or other  issues specified by the Commission. In such case the Commission will  publish a notice in the Federal Register containing a statement of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of the rule or order to which objections have  been filed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The issues raised by the objections or the issues on which the  Commission wishes to receive evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time and place for hearing, the time to be at least thirty  (30) days after publication of the notice; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time within which, and the conditions under which, any  person who petitioned for issuance, amendment, or repeal of the rule or  order, or any person who filed objections sufficient to warrant the  holding of the hearing, or any other interested person, may file notice  of intention to participate in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parties. Any person who petitions for issuance, amendment, or  repeal of a rule or order, and any person who files objections  sufficient to warrant the holding of a hearing, and who files timely  notice of intention to participate, shall be regarded as a party and  shall be individually served with any pleadings filed in the proceeding.  Upon written application to the Administrative Law Judge and a showing  of good cause, any interested person may be designated by the  Administrative Law Judge as a party.
