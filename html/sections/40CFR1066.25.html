Refer to the standard-setting part and Sec.   1066.695 regarding specific recordkeeping requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must promptly send us organized, written records in English  if we ask for them. We may review them at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may waive specific reporting or recordkeeping requirements we  determine to be unnecessary for the purposes of this part and the  standard-setting part. Note that while we will generally keep the  records required by this part, we are not obligated to keep records we  determine to be unnecessary for us to keep. For example, while we  require you to keep records for invalid tests so we may verify that your  invalidation was appropriate, it is not necessary for us to keep records  for our own invalid tests.</p>
