                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State of Delaware is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq., subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR 271.9 through 271.17 and 271.21. The State's program, as administered by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval was effective on June 22, 1984, 48 FR 23837.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delaware is not authorized to implement any HSWA requirement in lieu of EPA unless EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to do so in a Federal Register notice granting Delaware authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delaware has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities, including conducting inspections under section 3007, 42 U.S.C. 6927, and taking enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003, 42 U.S.C. 6928, 6934 and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delaware must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Delaware must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Delaware obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, the newly authorized provisions will be listed in Sec.  272.401. If Delaware obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in Sec.  272.402.</p>
