                            <p class="depth0">You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any  individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the  affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected  source to demonstrate compliance with an organic HAP emission limit. You  must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with  add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source  for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance  using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating  operation or group of coating operations must comply with the applicable  emission limit in Sec. 63.4890, but is not required to meet the  operating limits or work practice standards in Sec. Sec. 63.4892 and  63.4893, respectively. You must meet all the requirements of this  section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission  limit in Sec. 63.4890 for the coating operation or group of coating  operations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to  this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning  materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant  material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do  not need to include organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning  materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating  operation for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls  option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> from  test results using ASTM Method D1475-90, information from the supplier  or manufacturer of   the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity  data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method  D1475-90 test results and such other information sources, the test  results will take precedence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determine the volume of each material used. You must determine  the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used  during the compliance period by measurement or usage records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions. The mass of organic  HAP emissions is the combined mass of organic HAP contained in all  coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the compliance  period minus the organic HAP in certain waste materials. Use Equation 1  of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MY03.021  Where:  He = Total mass of organic HAP emissions during the</p><p class="depth2">compliance period, kg. A = Total mass of organic HAP in the coatings used during the compliance</p><p class="depth2">period, kg, as calculated in Equation 1A of this section.

The TSDF may be either off-site or on-site. You may  not include in the determination of the total mass of organic HAP in  waste materials sent or designated for shipment to a hazardous waste  TSDF for treatment or disposal during each compliance period only waste  materials that are generated by coating operations the organic HAP  contained in wastewater, nor the organic HAP contained in any waste  material reused during the same compliance period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> You must determine either the amount of the waste materials  sent to a TSDF during the compliance period or the amount collected and  stored during the compliance period and designated for future transport  to a TSDF. Do not include in your determination of the total mass of  organic HAP in waste materials sent or designated for shipment to a  hazardous waste TSDF for treatment or disposal during each compliance  period only waste materials that are generated by coating operations any  waste materials sent to a TSDF during a compliance period if you have  already included them in the amount collected and stored during that or  a previous compliance period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the total mass of organic HAP contained in the waste  materials specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iv)</em> You must document your methodology to determine the amount of  waste materials and the total mass of organic HAP they contain, as  required in Sec. 63.4930(h). To the extent that waste manifests include  this information, they may be used as part of the documentation of the  amount of waste materials and mass of organic HAP contained in them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculate the total volume of coating solids used. Calculate the  total volume of coating solids used, which is the combined volume of  coating solids for all the coatings used during the compliance period,  using Equation 2 of this section: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MY03.025  Where:  Vst = Total volume of coating solids used during the</p><p class="depth2">compliance period, liters.

The calculated organic HAP emission  rate for the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the  applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4890. You must keep all records as  required by Sec. Sec. 63.4930 and 63.4931. As part of the Notification  of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.4910 and the semiannual  compliance reports required in Sec. 63.4920, you must identify the  coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the  emission rate without add-on controls option. If there were no  deviations from the emission limit, include a statement that the coating  operation or group of coating operations was in   compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance  period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to  the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4890, determined according to  this section.</p>
