                            <p class="depth0">A contractor debarred from further contracts for an indefinite  period under the Order may request reinstatement in a letter filed with  the Deputy Assistant Secretary at any time after the effective date of  the debarment. A contractor debarred for a fixed period may request  reinstatement in a letter filed with the Deputy Assistant Secretary 30  days prior to the expiration of the fixed debarment period, or at any  time thereafter. The filing of a reinstatement request 30 days before a  fixed debarment period ends will not result in early reinstatement. In  connection with the reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors  shall be required to show that they have established and will carry out  employment policies and   practices in compliance with the Order and implementing regulations.  Before reaching a decision, the Deputy Assistant Secretary may conduct a  compliance evaluation of the contractor and may require the contractor  to supply additional information regarding the request for  reinstatement. The Deputy Assistant Secretary shall issue a written  decision on the request.  [62 FR 44192, Aug. 19, 1997]</p>
