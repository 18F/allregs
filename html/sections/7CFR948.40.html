Master containers may bear the identification instead of the individual containers within said master container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insofar as the requirements of this section are concerned, the length of time for which an inspection certificate is valid may be established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When potatoes are inspected in accordance with the requirements of this section, a copy of each inspection certificate issued shall be made available to the committee by the inspection service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Area committees with the approval of the Colorado Potato Committee may recommend and the Secretary may require that no handler shall transport or cause the transportation of potatoes by motor vehicle or by other means unless such shipment is accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate issued thereon, or other document authorized by the committee to indicate that such inspection has been performed. Such certificate or document shall be surrendered to such authority as may be designated.</p><p class="depth2">Committees</p>
