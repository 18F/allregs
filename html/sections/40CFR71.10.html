                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delegation of part 71 program. The Administrator may delegate,  in whole or in part, with or without signature authority, the authority  to administer a part 71 operating permits program to a State, eligible  Tribe, local, or other non-State agency in accordance with the  provisions of this section. In order to be delegated authority to  administer a part 71 program, the delegate agency must submit a legal  opinion from the Attorney General from the State, or the attorney for  the State, local, interstate, or eligible Tribal agency that has  independent legal counsel, stating that the laws of the State, locality,  interstate compact or Indian Tribe provide adequate authority to carry  out all aspects of the delegated program. A Delegation of Authority  Agreement (Agreement) shall set forth the terms and conditions of the  delegation, shall specify the provisions that the delegate agency shall  be authorized to implement, and shall be entered into by the  Administrator and the delegate agency. The Agreement shall become  effective upon the date that both the Administrator and the delegate  agency have signed the Agreement. Once delegation becomes effective, the  delegate agency will be responsible, to the extent specified in the  Agreement, for administering the part 71 program for the area subject to  the Agreement. Delegate agencies that choose to receive electronic  documents as part of their delegated program must satisfy the  requirements of 40 CFR part 3--(Electronic reporting).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Publication of Notice of Delegation of Authority Agreement. The  Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register informing  the public of any delegation of a portion of the part 71 program to a  State, eligible Tribe, or local agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revision or revocation of Delegation of Authority Agreement. An  Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by  the Administrator after consultation with the delegate agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transmission of information to the Administrator. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a  part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of  this section, the delegate agency shall provide to the Administrator a  copy of each permit application (including any application for permit  modification), each proposed permit, and each final part 71 permit. The  applicant may be required by the delegate agency to provide a copy of  the permit application (including the compliance plan) directly to the  Administrator. Upon agreement with the Administrator, the delegate  agency may submit to the Administrator a permit application summary form  and any relevant portion of the permit application and compliance plan,  in place of the complete permit application and compliance plan. To the  extent practicable, the preceding information shall be provided in  computer-readable format compatible with EPA's national database  management system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)  of this section for any category of sources (including any class, type,  or size within such category) other than major sources by regulation for  a category of sources nationwide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retention of records. The records for each draft, proposed, and  final permit, and application for permit renewal or modification shall  be kept for a period of 5 years by the delegate agency. The delegate  agency shall also submit to the Administrator such information as the  Administrator may reasonably require to ascertain whether the delegate  agency is implementing, administering, and enforcing the delegated part  71 program in compliance with the requirements of the Act and of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prohibition of default issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of Federal  law and title V of the Act, when a part 71 program has been delegated in  accordance with the provisions of this section, no part 71 permit  (including a permit renewal or modification) will be issued   until affected States have had an opportunity to review the draft permit  as required pursuant to Sec. 71.8(a) and EPA has had an opportunity to  review the proposed permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To receive delegation of signature authority, the legal opinion  submitted by the delegate agency pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  section shall certify that no applicable provision of State, local or  Tribal law requires that a part 71 permit or renewal be issued after a  certain time if the delegate agency has failed to take action on the  application (or includes any other similar provision providing for  default issuance of a permit), unless EPA has waived such review for EPA  and affected States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> EPA objection. (1) The Administrator will object to the issuance  of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in  compliance with applicable requirements or requirements under this part.  No permit for which an application must be transmitted to the  Administrator under paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section shall be issued if  the Administrator objects to its issuance in writing within 45 days of  receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting information.  When a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the  provisions of this section, failure of the delegate agency to do any of  the following shall constitute grounds for an objection by the  Administrator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Comply with paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit any information necessary to review adequately the  proposed permit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Process the permit under the procedures required by Sec. Sec.  71.7 and 71.11; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Comply with the requirements of Sec. 71.8(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any EPA objection under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall  include a statement of the Administrator's reason(s) for objection and a  description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to  respond to the objection. The Administrator will provide the permit  applicant a copy of the objection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the delegate agency fails, within 90 days after the date of  an objection under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, to revise and  submit to the Administrator the proposed permit in response to the  objection, the Administrator shall issue or deny the permit in  accordance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Public petitions. In the case of a delegated program, any  interested person may petition the Administrator to reopen a permit for  cause as provided in Sec. 71.11(n).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Appeal of permits. When a part 71 program has been delegated  with signature authority in accordance with the provisions of this  section, any person or affected State that submitted recommendations or  comments on the draft permit, or that participated in the public hearing  process may petition the Environmental Appeals Board in accordance with  Sec. 71.11(l)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Nondelegable conditions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator's authority to  object to the issuance of a part 71 permit cannot be delegated to an  agency not within EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator's authority to act upon petitions submitted  pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section cannot be delegated to an  agency not within EPA.
