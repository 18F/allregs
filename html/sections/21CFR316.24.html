                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FDA will send a deficiency letter to the sponsor if the request for orphan-drug designation lacks information required under Sec. Sec. 316.20 and 316.21, or contains inaccurate or incomplete

information. FDA may consider a designation request voluntarily withdrawn if the sponsor fails to respond to the deficiency letter within 1 year of issuance of the deficiency letter, unless within that same timeframe the sponsor requests in writing an extension of time to respond. This request must include the reason(s) for the requested extension and the length of time of the requested extension. FDA will grant all reasonable requests for an extension. In the event FDA denies a request for an extension of time, FDA may consider the designation request voluntarily withdrawn. In the event FDA considers a designation request voluntarily withdrawn, FDA will so notify the sponsor in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FDA will grant the request for orphan-drug designation if none of the reasons described in Sec. 316.25 for requiring or permitting refusal to grant such a request applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a request for orphan-drug designation is granted, FDA will notify the sponsor in writing and will publicize the orphan-drug designation in accordance with Sec. 316.28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A sponsor may voluntarily withdraw an orphan-drug designation request or an orphan-drug designation at any time after the request is submitted or granted, respectively, by submitting a written request for withdrawal to FDA. FDA will acknowledge such withdrawal in a letter to the sponsor. Any benefits attendant to designation (such as orphan-exclusive approval) will cease once designation is voluntarily withdrawn, from the date of FDA's acknowledgement letter. If a sponsor voluntarily withdraws designation, FDA will publicize such withdrawal in accordance with Sec. 316.28.
