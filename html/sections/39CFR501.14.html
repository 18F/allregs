                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each authorized provider of Postage Evidencing Systems must  permanently hold title to all Postage Evidencing Systems that it  manufactures or distributes, except those purchased by the Postal  Service or distributed outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An authorized provider must maintain sufficient facilities for  and records of the business relationship, distribution, control,  storage, maintenance, repair, replacement, and destruction or disposal  of all Postage Evidencing Systems and their components to enable  accurate accounting and location thereof throughout the entire life  cycle of each Postage Evidencing System. A complete record shall entail  a list by serial number of all Postage Evidencing Systems manufactured  or distributed showing all movements of each system from the time that  it is produced until it is scrapped, and the reading of the ascending  register each time the system is checked into or out of service. These  records must be available for inspection by Postal Service officials at  any time during business hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To ensure adequate control over Postage Evidencing Systems,  plans for the following subjects must be submitted for prior approval,  in writing, to the office of Payment Technology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service procedures for all Postage Evidencing Systems--these are  procedures to address the process to be used for new Postage Evidencing  Systems as well as those previously leased to another customer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation and storage of Postage Evidencing Systems--these  are procedures that provide reasonable precautions to prevent use by  unauthorized individuals. Providers must ship all postage meters by  Postal Service Registered Mail[supreg] service unless given written  permission by the Postal Service to use another carrier. The provider  must demonstrate that the alternative delivery carrier employs security  procedures equivalent to those for Registered Mail service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postage Evidencing System examination/inspection procedures and  schedule--the provider is required to perform postage meter examinations  or inspections based on an approved schedule. Failure to complete the  postage meter examination or inspections by the due date may result in  the Postal Service requiring the provider to disable the meter's  resetting capability. If necessary, the Postal Service shall notify the  customer that the postage meter is to be removed from service and the  authorization to use a Postage Evidencing System revoked, following the  procedures for revocation specified by regulation. The Postal Service  shall notify the provider to remove the postage meter from the  customer's location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Out-of-service procedures for a nonfaulty Postage Evidencing  System--these procedures must be used when the system is to be removed  from service for any reason.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Postage Evidencing System repair process--any physical or  electronic access to the internal components of a postage meter, as well  as any access to software or security parameters, must be conducted  within an approved facility under the provider's direct control and  active supervision. To prevent unauthorized use, the provider or any  third party acting on its behalf must keep secure any equipment or other  component that can be used to open or access the internal, electronic,  or secure components of a postage meter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Handling procedures for faulty meters--the provider must  maintain handling procedures for faulty meters, including those that are  inoperable, mis-registering, have unreadable registers, inaccurately  reflect their current status, show any evidence of possible tampering or  abuse, and those for which there is any indication that the postage  meter has some mechanical or electrical malfunction of any critical  security component, such as any component the improper operation of  which could adversely affect Postal Service revenues, or of any memory  component, or that affects the accuracy of the registers or the accuracy  of the value printed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lost or stolen postage meter procedures--the provider must  promptly report to the Postal Service the loss or theft of any postage  meter or the recovery of any lost or stolen postage meter. Such  notification to the Postal Service will be made by completing and filing  a standardized lost and stolen meter incident report within 10 calendar  days of the provider's determination of a meter loss, theft, or  recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Postage meter destruction--when required, the postage meter must  be rendered completely inoperable by the destruction process and  associated postage; printing dies and components must be destroyed.  Manufacturers or distributors of meters must submit the proposed  destruction method; a schedule listing the postage meters to be  destroyed, by serial number and model; and the proposed time and place  of destruction to Payment Technology for approval prior to any meter  destruction. Providers must record and retain the serial numbers of the  meters to be destroyed and provide a list of such serial numbers in  electronic form in accordance with Postal Service requirements for meter  accounting and tracking systems. Providers must give sufficient advance  notice of the destruction to allow Payment Technology to schedule  observation by its designated representative who shall verify that the  destruction is performed in accordance with a Postal Service-approved  method or process. To the extent that the Postal Service elects not to  observe a particular destruction, the provider must submit a  certification of destruction, including the serial number(s), to the  Postal Service within 5 calendar days of destruction. These requirements  for meter destruction apply to all postage meters, Postage Evidencing  Systems, and postal security devices included as a component of a  Postage Evidencing System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the provider uses a third party to perform functions that may  have an impact upon a Postage Evidencing System (especially its  security), including, but not limited to, business relationships,  repair, maintenance, and disposal of Postage Evidencing Systems, Payment  Technology must be advised in advance of all aspects of the  relationship, as they relate to the custody and control of Postage  Evidencing Systems and must specifically authorize in   writing the proposed arrangement between the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Postal Service authorization of a third-party relationship to  perform specific functions applies only to the functions stated in the  written authorization but may be amended to embrace additional  functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No third-party relationship shall compromise the Postage  Evidencing System, or its components, including, but not limited to, the  hardware, software, communications, and security components, or of any  security-related system with which it interfaces, including, but not  limited to, the resetting system, reporting systems, and Postal Service  support systems. The functions of the third party with respect to a  Postage Evidencing System, its components, and the systems with which it  interfaces are subject to the same scrutiny as the equivalent functions  of the provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any authorized third party must keep adequate facilities for and  records of Postage Evidencing Systems and their components in accordance  with paragraph (b) of this section. All such facilities and records are  subject to inspection by Postal Service representatives, insofar as they  are used to distribute, control, store, maintain, repair, replace,  destroy, or dispose of Postage Evidencing Systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provider must ensure that any party acting on its behalf in  any of the functions described in paragraph (b) of this section  maintains adequate facilities, records, and procedures for the security  of the Postage Evidencing Systems. Deficiencies in the operations of a  third party relating to the custody and control of Postage Evidencing  Systems, unless corrected in a timely manner, can place at risk a  provider's approval to manufacture and/or distribute Postage Evidencing  Systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Postal Service reserves the right to review all aspects of  any relationship if it appears that the relationship poses a threat to  Postage Evidencing System security and may require the provider to take  appropriate corrective action. By entering into any relationship under  this section, the provider is not relieved of any responsibility to the  Postal Service, and such must be stated in any memorialization of the  relationship.
