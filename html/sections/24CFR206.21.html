A fixed interest rate is agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustable interest rate. An initial interest rate is agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee. The interest rate shall be adjusted in one of two ways depending on the option selected by the mortgagor. Whenever an interest rate is adjusted, the new interest rate applies to the entire mortgage balance.

The first adjustment must occur on the first day of the second full month after closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pre-loan Disclosure. (1) At the time the mortgagee provides the mortgagor with a loan application, a mortgagee also shall provide a mortgagor with a written explanation of any adjustable interest rate features of a mortgage.

The explanation must include the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the time the mortgagee provides the mortgagor with a loan application, a mortgagee also shall provide a mortgagor with a written explanation of any adjustable interest rate features of a mortgage.
