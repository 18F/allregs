Platelets must not be pooled during processing unless the platelets are pooled as specified in the directions for use for the blood collecting, processing, and storage system approved for such use by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immediately after collection, the whole blood or plasma shall be held in storage between 20 and 24 [deg]C unless it must be transported from the collection center to the processing laboratory. During such transport, all reasonable methods shall be used to maintain the temperature as close as possible to a range between 20 and 24 [deg]C until it arrives at the processing laboratory where it shall be held between 20 and 24 [deg]C until the platelets are separated. The platelet concentrate shall be separated within 4 hours or within the timeframe specified in the directions for use for the blood collecting, processing, and storage system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The time and speed of centrifugation must have been demonstrated to produce an unclumped product, without visible hemolysis, that yields a count of not less than 5.5 x 10\10\ platelets per unit in at least 75 percent of the units tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The volume of original plasma used for resuspension of the platelets shall be determined by the maintenance of a pH of not less than 6.2 during the storage period. The pH shall be measured on a sample of platelets

which has been stored for the maximum dating period at the selected storage temperature. One of the following storage temperatures shall be used continuously:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 20 to 24 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 1 to 6 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final containers used for Platelets shall be colorless and transparent to permit visual inspection of the contents; any closure shall maintain a hermetic seal and prevent contamination of the contents. The container material shall not interact with the contents, under the customary conditions of storage and use, in such a manner as to have an adverse effect upon the safety, purity, potency, or efficacy of the product. At the time of filling, the final container shall be marked or identified by number so as to relate it to the donor.
