If the no-load loss measurements were made between 10 [deg]C and 30 [deg]C, this correction is not required. If the correction to reference temperature is applied, then the core temperature of the transformer during no-load loss measurement (Tnm) must be determined within 10 [deg]C of the true average core temperature.

Load losses consist of ohmic loss in the windings due to the load current and stray losses due to the eddy currents induced by the leakage flux in the windings, core clamps, magnetic shields, tank walls, and other conducting parts. The ohmic loss of a transformer varies directly with temperature, whereas the stray losses vary inversely with temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For a transformer with a tap changer, conduct the test at the rated current and rated-voltage tap position. For a transformer that has a configuration of windings which allows for more than one nominal rated voltage, determine its load losses either in the winding configuration in which the highest losses occur or in each winding configuration in which the transformer can operate.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.2 Tests for Measuring Load Losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Connect the transformer with either the high-voltage or low-voltage windings to the appropriate test set. Then short-circuit the winding that was not connected to the test set. Apply a voltage at the rated frequency (of the transformer under test) to the connected windings to produce the rated current in the transformer. Take the readings of the wattmeter(s), the ammeters(s), and rms voltmeter(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Regardless of the test set selected, the following preparatory requirements must be satisfied for accurate test results:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine the temperature of the windings using the applicable method in section 3.2.1 or section 3.2.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The conductors used to short-circuit the windings must have a cross-sectional

area equal to, or greater than, the corresponding transformer leads, or, if the tester uses a different method to short-circuit the windings, the losses in the short-circuiting conductor assembly must be less than 10 percent of the transformer's load losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the tester uses a power supply that is not synchronized with an electric utility grid, such as a dc/ac motor-generator set, follow the provisions of the ``Note'' in section 4.4.2.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3 Corrections.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3.1 Correction for Losses from Instrumentation and Auxiliary Devices.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3.1.1 Instrumentation Losses.</p><p class="depth0">Measured losses attributable to the voltmeters, wattmeter voltage circuit and short-circuiting conductor (SC), and to the voltage transformers if they are used, may be deducted from the total load losses measured during testing.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3.1.2 Losses from Auxiliary Devices.</p><p class="depth0">Measured losses attributable to auxiliary devices (e.g., circuit breakers, fuses, switches) installed in the transformer, if any, that are not part of the winding and core assembly, may be excluded from load losses measured during testing. To exclude these losses, either (1) measure transformer losses without the auxiliary devices by removing or by-passing them, or (2) measure transformer losses with the auxiliary devices connected, determine the losses associated with the auxiliary devices, and deduct these losses from the load losses measured during testing.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3.2 Correction for Phase Angle Errors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corrections for phase angle errors are not required if the instrumentation is calibrated over the entire range of power factors and phase angle errors.

Where the total system phase angle is equal to or less than 12 milliradians (41 minutes), use either equation 4-4 or 4-5 to correct the measured load loss power for phase angle errors, and where the total system phase angle exceeds 12 milliradians (41 minutes) use equation 4-5, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AP06.019
