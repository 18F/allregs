                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days of receipt of a petition, the regulatory  authority shall notify the petitioner by certified mail whether the  petition is complete under Sec. 764.13 (b) or (c). Complete, for a  designation or termination petition, means that the information required  under Sec. 764.13 (b) or (c) has been provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulatory authority shall determine whether any identified  coal resources exist in the area covered by the petition, without  requiring any showing from the petitioner. If the regulatory authority  finds there are not any identified coal resources in that area, it shall  return the petition to the petitioner with a statement of the findings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the regulatory authority determines that the petition is  incomplete, frivolous, or that the petitioner does not meet the  requirements of Sec. 764.13(a), it shall return the petition to the  petitioner with a written statement of the reasons for the determination  and the categories of information needed to make the petition complete.  A frivolous petition is one in which the allegations of harm lack  serious merit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When considering a petition for an area which was previously and  unsuccessfully proposed for designation, the regulatory authority shall  determine if the new petition presents significant new allegations of  facts with evidence which tends to establish the allegations. If the  petition does not contain such material, the regulatory authority may  choose not to consider the petition and may return the petition to the  petitioner, with a statement of its findings and a reference to the  record of the previous designation proceedings where the facts were  considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The regulatory authority shall notify the person who submits a  petition of any application for a permit received which includes any  area covered by the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The regulatory authority may determine not to process any  petition received insofar as it pertains to lands for which an  administratively complete permit application has been filed and the  first newspaper notice has been published. Based on such a  determination, the regulatory authority may issue a decision on a  complete and accurate permit application and shall inform the petitioner  why the regulatory authority cannot consider the part of the petition  pertaining to the proposed permit area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly after a petition is received, the regulatory  authority shall notify the general public of the receipt of the petition  by a newspaper advertisement placed in the locale of the area covered by  the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the  region of the petitioned area and in any official State register of  public notices. The regulatory authority shall make copies of the  petition available to the public and shall provide copies of the  petition to other interested governmental agencies, intervenors, persons  with an ownership interest of record in the property, and other persons  known to the regulatory authority to have an interest in the property.  Proper notice to persons with   an ownership interest of record in the property shall comply with the  requirements of applicable State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Promptly after the determination that a petition is complete,  the regulatory authority shall request submissions from the general  public of relevant information by a newspaper advertisement placed once  a week for two consecutive weeks in the locale of the area covered by  the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the  region of the petitioned area, and in any offical State register of  public notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Until three days before the regulatory authority holds a hearing  under Sec. 764.17, any person may intervene in the proceeding by filing  allegations of facts describing how the designation determination  directly affects the intervenor, supporting evidence, a short statement  identifying the petition to which the allegations pertain, and the  intervenor's name, address and telephone number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Beginning from the date a petition is filed, the regulatory  authority shall compile and maintain a record consisting of all  documents relating to the petition filed with or prepared by the  regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall make the record  available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at  reasonable cost during all normal hours at the main office of the  regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall also maintain  information at or near the area in which the petitioned land is located  and make this information available to the public for inspection free of  charge and for copying at reasonable cost during all normal business  hours. At a minimum, this information shall include a copy of the  petition.  [48 FR 41351, Sept. 14, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 49323, 49324, Dec. 30,  1987]</p>
