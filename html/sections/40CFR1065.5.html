                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part specifies procedures that apply generally to testing  various categories of engines. See the standard-setting part for  directions in applying specific provisions in this part for a particular  type of engine. Before using this part's procedures, read the standard- setting part to answer at least the following questions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> What duty cycles must I use for laboratory testing?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Should I warm up the test engine before measuring emissions, or  do I need to measure cold-start emissions during a warm-up segment of  the duty cycle?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Which exhaust constituents do I need to measure? Measure all  exhaust constituents that are subject to emission standards, any other  exhaust constituents needed for calculating emission rates, and any  additional exhaust constituents as specified in the standard-setting  part. Alternatively, you may omit the measurement of N2O and  CH4 for an engine, provided it is not subject to an  N2O or CH4 emission standard. If you omit the  measurement of N2O and CH4, you must provide other  information and/or data that will give us a reasonable basis for  estimating the engine's emission rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Do any unique specifications apply for test fuels?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> What maintenance steps may I take before or between tests on an  emission-data engine?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Do any unique requirements apply to stabilizing emission levels  on a new engine?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Do any unique requirements apply to test limits, such as ambient  temperatures or pressures?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Is field testing required or allowed, and are there different  emission standards or procedures that apply to field testing?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Are there any emission standards specified at particular engine- operating conditions or ambient conditions?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Do any unique requirements apply for durability testing?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The testing specifications in the standard-setting part may  differ from the specifications in this part. In cases where it is not  possible to comply with both the standard-setting part and this part,  you must comply with the specifications in the standard-setting part.  The standard-setting part may also allow you to deviate from the  procedures of this part for other reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following table shows how this part divides testing  specifications into subparts:</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 of Sec.   1065.5--Description of Part 1065 Subparts ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Describes these specifications or</p><p class="depth2">This subpart                          procedures ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Subpart A....................
