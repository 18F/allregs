(followed by the type of authority request, e.g., exemption, frequency allocation) and, where applicable, shall state if the application involves renewal and/or amendment of existing exemption authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Factual statement. Each application shall state:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The section(s) of the Statute or the rule, regulation, term, condition, or limitation from which the exemption is requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The proposed effective date and duration of the exemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of how the applicant proposes to exercise the authority (for example, applications for exemption from section 41101 or 41301 of the Statute should include at least: places to be served; equipment types, capacity and source; type and frequency or service; and other operations that the proposed service will connect with or support); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any other facts the applicant relies upon to establish that the proposed service will be consistent with the public interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Supporting evidence. (1) Each application shall be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement of economic data, or other matters or information that the applicant desires the Department to officially notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Affidavits, or statements under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001, establishing any other facts the applicant wants the Department to rely upon; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Information showing the applicant is qualified to perform the proposed services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an application for exemption from section 41101 or 41301 of the Statute (except exemptions under section 40109(g)) shall state whether the authority sought is governed by a bilateral agreement or by principles of comity and reciprocity. Applications by foreign carriers shall state whether the applicant's homeland government grants U.S. carriers authority similar to that requested. If so, the application shall state whether the fact of reciprocity has been established by the Department and cite the pertinent finding. If the fact of reciprocity has not been established by the Department, the application shall include documentation to establish such reciprocity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Emergency cabotage.

An application requesting renewal of an exemption or other limited authority under this subpart that is intended to invoke the automatic extension provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) shall comply with, and contain the statements and information required by part 377 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Record of service.
