                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Clean Air Act and a petition  submitted by the Governor of the Virgin Islands, an exemption to section  123 of the Clean Air Act is granted to the Hess Oil Virgin Islands  Corporation (HOVIC) at the St. Croix refinery. Specifically, the  exemption waives the prohibition on the implementation of an  Intermittent Control Strategy (ICS) based upon atmospheric conditions in  order to set emission limitations. The emission limitations shall depend  upon the sulfur content in the residual oil burned at the refinery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HOVIC shall maintain a meteorological tower on its property for  the purpose of the ICS which meets the required EPA QA/QC operating  specifications. At a minimum, the wind direction data will be monitored,  collected and reported as 1-hour averages, starting on the hour. If the  average wind direction for a given hour is from within the designated  sector, the wind will be deemed to have flowed from within the sector  for that hour. Each ``day'' or ``block period'', for these purposes will  start at midnight and end the following midnight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HOVIC shall maintain SO2 ambient monitors and collect ambient  SO2 concentration data for the purpose of implementing the ICS at nearby  locations approved by EPA and specified in the PSD permit. The ambient  monitors must follow the required EPA QA/QC operating specifications. At  a minimum, the data will be collected according to EPA approved State  and Local Ambient Monitoring Stations procedures found at 40 CFR 58.20,  but will, for these purposes, be averaged by the hour, starting on the  hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The winds blow from a 45 degree sector defined as 143 to 187  degrees inclusive, where zero degrees is due north, for at least 6  consecutive hours during a 24-hour block period or any 12 non- consecutive hours during a 24 hour block period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One of HOVIC's ICS monitors measures an average ambient SO2  concentration that is 75% of the 24-hour NAAQS during any rolling 24- hour average. (75% of the 24-hour NAAQS = 274 ug/m3 or 0.105 ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(iii)</em> of  this section are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section for at least 3 consecutive hours  following the period during which the winds were blowing inside the  sector.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section, the switch back may occur after all of HOVIC's ICS ambient  monitors measure a 24-hour average concentration which is less than 75%  of the NAAQS for at least one 24-hour block period following any  occurrence when the monitor measured the concentration which was 75% of  the NAAQS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the ICS was triggered by both paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and  (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the switch back may occur when both of the  conditions in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) of this section are  met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The protocol may be modified by EPA to protect against  exceedances of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event that there is an exceedance of the NAAQS, HOVIC  will report the exceedance to EPA and recommend corrective action as  well as amendments to the protocol to ensure the protection of the  NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> HOVIC must comply with all fuel switching requirements,  contained in HOVIC's PSD permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This exemption shall take effect only in the event that a final  PSD permit modification becomes effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Administrator may terminate the exemption through rulemaking  procedures upon determining that HOVIC's use of the ICS is causing or  contributing to an exceedance of the NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pursuant to section 325(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and a  petition submitted by the Governor of United States Virgin Islands on  July 21, 2003, (``2003 Petition''), the Administrator of EPA  conditionally exempts Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority  (``VIWAPA'') from certain CAA requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A waiver of the requirement to obtain a PSD permit prior to  construction is granted for the electric generating unit identified in  the 2003 Petition as Unit 23, St. Krum Bay plant in St. Thomas with the  following condition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unit 23 shall not operate until a final PSD permit is received  by VIWAPA for this unit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unit 23 shall not operate until it complies with all  requirements of its PSD permit, including, if necessary, retrofitting  with BACT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If Unit 23 operates either prior to the issuance of a final  PSD permit or without BACT equipment, Unit 23 shall be deemed in  violation of this waiver and the CAA beginning on the date of  commencement of construction of the unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]  [62 FR 61205, Nov. 14, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 10335, Mar. 5, 2004]</p>
