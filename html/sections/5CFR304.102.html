When an agency  requires public advisory participation, a consultant also may be a  person who is affected by a   particular program and can provide useful views from personal  experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A consultant position is one that requires providing advice,  views, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations on a temporary and/or  intermittent basis on issues, problems, or questions presented by a  Federal official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An expert is a person who is specially qualified by education  and experience to perform difficult and challenging tasks in a  particular field beyond the usual range of achievement of competent  persons in that field. An expert is regarded by other persons in the  field as an authority or practitioner of unusual competence and skill in  a professional, scientific, technical or other activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An expert position is one that requires the services of a  specialist with skills superior to those of others in the same  profession, occupation, or activity to perform work on a temporary and/ or intermittent basis assigned by a Federal official. For example, a  microbial contamination specialist may apply new test methods to  identify bacteria on products, a computer scientist may adapt advanced  methods to develop a complex software system, or a plate maker may  engrave a novel design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Intemittent employment, as defined in part 340, subpart D, of  this chapter, means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of  duty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Temporary employment means employment not to exceed 1 year. An  expert or consultant serving under a temporary appointment may have a  full-time, part-time, seasonal, or intermittent work schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employment without compensation means unpaid service that is  provided at the agency's request and is to perform duties that are  unclassified. It is not volunteer service.</p>
