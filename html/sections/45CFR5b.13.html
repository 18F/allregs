                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Policy. Where applicable, fees for copying records will be  charged in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. Fees  may only be charged where an individual requests that a copy be made of  the record to which he is granted access. No fee may be charged for  making a search of the system of records whether the search is manual,  mechanical, or electronic. Where a copy of the record must be made in  order to provide access to the record (e.g., computer printout where no  screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to the  individual without cost. Where a medical record is made available to a  representative designated by the individual or to a physician or health  professional designated by a parent or guardian under Sec. 5b.6 of this  part, no fee will be charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fee schedule. The fee schedule for the Department is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Copying of records susceptible to photocopying--$.10 per page.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Copying records not susceptible to photocopying (e.g., punch  cards or magnetic tapes)--at actual cost to be determined on a case-by- case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No charge will be made if the total amount of copying does not  exceed $25.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 5b--Employee Standards of Conduct</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. All employees are required to be aware of their  responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.  Regulations implementing the Act are set forth in 45 CFR 5b. Instruction  on the requirements of the Act and regulation shall be provided to all  new employees of the Department. In addition, supervisors shall be  responsible for assuring that employees who are working with systems of  records or who undertake new duties which require the use of systems of  records are informed of their responsibilities. Supervisors shall also  be responsible for assuring that all employees who work with such  systems of records are periodically reminded of the requirements of the  Act and are advised of any new provisions or interpretations of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Penalties. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All employees must guard against improper  disclosure f records which are governed by the Act. Because of the  serious consequences of improper invasions of personal privacy,  employees may be subject to disciplinary action and criminal prosecution  for knowing and willful violations of the Act and regulation. In  addition, employees may also be subject to disciplinary action for  unknowing or unwillful violations, where the employee had notice of the  provisions of the Act and regulations and failed to inform himself  sufficiently or to conduct himself in accordance with the requirements  to avoid violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Department may be subjected to civil liability for the  following actions undertaken by its employees:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Making a determination under the Act and Sec. Sec. 5b.7 and  5b.8 of the regulation not to amend an individual's record in accordance  with his request, or failing to make such review in conformity with  those provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Refusing to comply with an individual's request for notification  of or access to a record pertaining to hiem;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failing to maintain any record pertaining to any individual with  such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary  to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications,  character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual  that may be made on the basis of such a record, and consequently a  determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failing to comply with any other provision of the Act or any  rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect  on an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An employee may be personally subject to criminal liability as  set forth below and in 5 U.S.C. 552a (i):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any officer or employee of an agency, who by virtue of his  employment or official position, has possession of, or access to, agency  records which contain individually identifiable information the  disclosure of which is prohibited by the Act or by rules or regulations  established thereunder, and who, knowing that disclosure of the specific  material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any  manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be  guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any officer or employee of any agency who willfully maintains a  system of records without meeting the notice requirements [of the Act]  shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules Governing Employees Not Working With Systems of Records.  Employees whose duties do not involve working with systems of records  will not generally disclose to any one, without specific authorization  from their supervisors, records pertaining to employees or other  individuals which by reason of their official duties are available to  them. Notwithstanding the above, the following records concerning  Federal employees are a matter of public record and no further  authorization is necessary for disclosure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and title of individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grade classification or equivalent and annual rate of salary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Position description.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Location of duty station, including room number and telephone  number.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, employees shall disclose records which are listed in  the Department's Freedom of Information Regulation as being available to  the public. Requests for other records will be referred to the  responsible Department official. This does not preclude employees from  discussing matters which are known to them personally, and without  resort to a record, to official investigators of Federal agencies for  official purposes such as suitability checks, Equal Employment  Opportunity investigations, adverse action proceedings, grievance  proceedings, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules governing employees whose duties require use or reference  to systems of records. Employees whose official duties require that they  refer to, maintain, service, or otherwise deal with systems of records  (hereinafter referred to as ``Systems Employees'') are governed by the  general provisions. In addition, extra precautions are required and  systems employees are held to higher standards of conduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Systems Employees shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Be informed with respect to their responsibilities under the  Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Be alert to possible misuses of the system and report to their  supervisors any potential or actual use of the system which they believe  is not in compliance with the Act and regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Make a disclosure of records within the Department only to an  employee who has a legitimate need to know the record in the course of  his official duties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Maintain records as accurately as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Consult with a supervisor prior to taking any action where they  are in doubt whether such action is in conformance with the Act and  regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Systems Employees shall not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Disclose in any form records from a system of records except (1)  with the consent or at the request of the subject individual; or (2)  where its disclosure is permitted under Sec. 5b.9 of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Permit unauthorized individuals to be present in controlled  areas. Any unauthorized individuals observed in controlled areas shall  be reported to a supervisor or to the guard force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Knowingly or willfully take action which might subject the  Department to civil liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Make any arrangements for the design development, or operation  of any system of records without making reasonable effort to provide  that the system can be maintained in accordance with the Act and  regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Contracting officers. In addition to any applicable provisions  set forth above, those employees whose official duties involve entering  into contracts on behalf of the Department shall also be governed by the  following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contracts for design, or development of systems and equipment.  No contract for the design or development of a system of records, or for  equipment to store, service or maintain a system of records shall be  entered into unless the contracting officer has made reasonable effort  to ensure that the product to be purchased is capable of being used  without violation of the Act or regulation. Special attention shall be  given to provision of physical safeguards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracts for the operation of systems of records. A review by  the Contracting Officer, in conjunction with other officials whom he  feels appropriate, of all proposed contracts providing for the operation  of systems of records shall be made prior to execution of the contracts  to determine whether operation of the system of records is for the  purpose of accomplishing a Department function. If a determination is  made that the operation of the system is to accomplish a Department  function, the contracting officer shall be responsible for including in  the contract appropriate provisions to apply the   provisions of the Act and regulation to the system, including  prohibitions against improper release by the contractor, his employees,  agents, or subcontractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other service contracts. Contracting officers entering into  general service contracts shall be responsible for determining the  appropriateness of including provisions in the contract to prevent  potential misuse (inadvertent or otherwise) by employees, agents, or  subcontractors of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rules Governing Responsible Department Officials. In addition to  the requirements for Systems Employees, responsible Department officials  shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Respond to all requests for notification of or access,  disclosure, or amendment of records in a timely fashion in accordance  with the Act and regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Make any amendment of records accurately and in a timely  fashion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inform all persons whom the accounting records show have  received copies of the record prior to the amendments of the correction;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Associate any statement of disagreement with the disputed  record, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Transmit a copy of the statement to all persons whom the  accounting records show have received a copy of the disputed record, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transmit that statement with any future disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
