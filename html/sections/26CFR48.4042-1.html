                                Sec. 48.4042-1  Tax on fuel used in commercial waterway transportation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> imposes an excise tax on the use of  liquid fuel in the propulsion system of commercial transportation  vessels while traveling on certain inland and intracoastal waterways  (see Sec. 48.4042-1 (f)). The tax applies generally to all types of  vessels, including ships, barges, and tugboats. It is in addition to all  other taxes imposed on the sale or use of fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Person liable for tax. The person operating the vessel in which  the propulsion fuel is consumed is the user of liquid fuel for purposes  of section 4042(a). Thus, a person who operates (or whose employees  operate) a vessel is responsible for filing returns and paying the tax.  If a vessel owner (or lessee) contracts with an independent contractor  to operate the vessel, the independent contractor is the user of liquid  fuel for purposes of section 4042(a), regardless of who purchases the  fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time of use. Fuel is not taxed by section 4042(a) when put into  a vessel's tanks. For purposes of section 4042(a), fuel is used when it  is actually consumed by a vessel's engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquid fuel. For purposes of the tax imposed under this section,  liquid fuel means any liquid fuel including gasoline, diesel fuel,  special motor fuel, or Bunker C residual fuel oil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Commercial waterway transportation--(1) In general. For purposes  of section 4042(a) and Sec. 48.4042-2(c)(1), the term ``commercial  waterway transportation'' means the use of a vessel on the waterways  specified in paragraphs (g) </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (27) of this section if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of the vessel is in the business of transporting property  for compensation or hire, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section will be deemed ``commercial waterway  transportation,'' regardless of whether the vessel is actually engaged  in the transportation of property on a particular voyage. Thus,  ``commercial waterway transportation'' includes the operation of vessels  while moving empty of cargo, while awaiting passage through locks, while  dislodging vessels grounded on a sandbar, while moving to or from a  repair facility, while maneuvering around loading and unloading docks,  and while fleeting barges into a single tow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fishing vessels exception. A vessel does not transport property  in the business of the owner, lessee, or operator, for purposes of  paragraph (f)(1)(ii)   of this section, by merely transporting fish or other aquatic animal  life caught on the voyage. The tax imposed by section 4042(a) does not  apply to fuel used by a fishing vessel while traveling to a fishing  site, while engaged in fishing, or while returning from the fishing site  with its catch. However, the tax applies to fuel used by a commercial  vessel along the taxable waterways while traveling to pick up aquatic  animal life caught by another vessel and while transporting the catch of  such other vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Specified waterways. Only fuel used on those waterways specified  in section 206 of the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (specified  waterways) is taxable.
