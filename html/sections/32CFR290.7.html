                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedures for processing material in accordance with the FOIA  are outlined in DCAAP 5410.14. General provisions are outlined in the  following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requests for audit reports. Audit reports prepared by DCAA are  the property of and are prepared for the use of DoD contracting  officers. As a result, their release should be at the sole discretion of  the DoD contracting activity. Requesters seeking audit reports should  send their requests directly to the DoD contracting activity to avoid  administrative delay. Typically, requests for copies of DCAA audit  reports may be identified by requesting those that relate to a specific  contract number (e.g. DLA600-89-P0222). DoD contract numbers may be  easily matched to the cognizant DoD contracting activity by referring to  48 CFR, ``DoD FAR Supplement'' Appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Although DCAA can make a release determination on audit  reports produced for non-DoD agencies, administrative procedure  routinely dictates coordination with that agency prior to responding to  the request. Requesters seeking expeditious processing should forward  their requests directly to the cognizant contracting officer for  processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requests for audit working papers. Audit working papers, as  described in appendix D, may be sought occasionally in conjunction with  an audit report or as an independent demand. Normally, the release of  such records is entirely dependent on the releasability of the related  audit report. (Note: The procedures for determining the releasability of  audit reports is provided in general in the aforementioned paragraph and  in more detail in DCAAP 5410.14). Since the content of audit working  paper files can be quite diverse and often voluminous, FOIA Coordinators  should work closely with the requester to ensure that the records  produced are narrowly defined and entirely responsive to the requester's  needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Public inspection and copying. Section (a)(2) of the Freedom of  Information Act requires agencies to make available for public  inspection and copying, final opinions made in the adjudication of  cases, statements of policy not yet published in the Federal Register,  and administrative manuals and instructions. This requirement is  satisfied by the publication of DCAAI 5025.2, \5\ ``DCAA Index of  Publications'' and DCAAI 5025.13, \6\ ``Index of DCAA Memorandums for  Regional Directors''. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 290.4(c).</p><p class="depth0">\6\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 290.4(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requests for the examination or copies of records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Members  of the public may make written requests for copies of DCAA records or  for permission to examine such records during normal business hours.  Such requests must be in writing and either explicitly or implicitly  invoke the Freedom of Information Act, or this rule. These requests  should be submitted directly to the appropriate DCAA organizational  element listed in appendix B of this rule. If the appropriate DCAA  organizational element is either unknown or cannot be ascertained, and  the record is likely to be in the possession of DCAA, the request may be  submitted to Defense Contract Audit Agency, Attn: CM, 8725 John J.  Kingman Road, Suite 2135, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6219.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When submitting requests, requesters should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify each record sought with sufficient detail to facilitate  the location and easy access to the record requested. Information as to  where the record originated, subject, date, number, or any other  identifying particulars should be provided whenever possible. DCAA  organizational elements receiving requests which do not reasonably  describe the record requested will advise the requester accordingly.  Generally, a record is not reasonably described unless the requester  provides information permitting an organized, nonrandom search of DCAA  files and/or information systems. In providing descriptions based on  events, the requester must provide information which permits DCAA  organizational elements to, at least, infer the specific record sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify all other Federal agencies subject to the provisions  of the FOIA to which the request has been sent. This will reduce both  processing and coordination time between agencies and redundant  referrals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a statement of their willingness to pay assessable  charges. The statement must include a specific monetary amount if the  assessable fees are likely to exceed the fee waiver   threshold of $15.00 or a specific justification for any waiver or  reduction of fees sought based on public interest in release or  disclosure. DCAA organizational elements will notify requesters of  deficiencies in fee declarations, and provide them the opportunity to  amend initial declarations. Determinations on the adequacy of requester  fee declarations are not subject to appeal unless: The DCAA  organizational element has denied a specific request for the assessment  of fees under one of the established requester categories; or has denied  a request for the waiver or reduction of fees in the public interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a DCAA organizational element has no records responsive to  a request, the requester will be notified promptly that should he or she  determine such request to be adverse in nature, he or she may exercise  their appeal rights. In cases where the request has been misdirected and  the DCAA organizational element is aware of the appropriate FOIA  respondent, they shall refer the request to the appropriate DCAA  organizational element or other Federal agency through FOIA channels,  and notify the requester of the referral. The 20 working day period  allowed for responding to requests will not begin until the DCAA  organizational element having the responsive records receives a request  complying with procedural requirements of this rule, including  statements on the payment of fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of the FOIA are intended for parties with private  interests. Officials seeking documents or information on behalf of  foreign governments, other Federal agencies, and state or local agencies  should be encouraged to employ official channels. The release of records  to individuals under the FOIA is a public release of information. DCAA  organizational elements will consider FOIA requests from such officials  as made in a private, rather than official capacity, and will make  disclosure and fee determinations accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Referrals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records originating in or based on information  obtained from other Federal agencies subject to the FOIA may be referred  to that agency. In processing FOIA requests for such records, DCAA  elements, after coordinating with the originating agency, may refer the  request, along with a copy of the responsive records in its possession,  to that agency for direct response. The requester is to be notified of  the referral. However, if for investigative or intelligence purposes,  the outside agency desires anonymity, FOIA Coordinators may only respond  directly to the requester after coordination with the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Referral of audit reports. Audit reports prepared by DCAA are  the property of and are prepared for the use of the DoD contracting  officers. Their release is at the discretion of the DoD contracting  activity. Therefore any FOIA request for audit reports prepared for DoD  components should be referred to the cognizant DoD contracting activity  and the requester notified of the referral. To avoid the delay  associated with the referral process, requesters should be advised to  send requests for audit reports directly to the cognizant DoD  contracting activity. Requests for audit reports prepared for non-DoD  agencies should be treated as requests for DCAA records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Referral of work papers. When a requester seeks workpapers, the  cognizant contracting officer must furnish a notice of disposition to  the appropriate activity pertaining to the releasability of the audit  report. The notice of disposition will then be used to determine  releasability of the workpapers. Details concerning the appropriate  processing procedures may be found in DCAAP 5410.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All other requests should be directed to the appropriate  Regional Director, if known. When the location of the record is not  known, the request should be directed to the DCAA Information and  Privacy Advisor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Time limits. DCAA organizational elements are to respond  promptly to requesters complying with the procedural requirements  outlined in this rule. When a significant number of requests are being  processed, e.g. 10 or more, the requests shall be completed in order of  receipt. However, this does not preclude completing action on a request  which can be easily answered, regardless of its ranking within the order  of receipt. Action may be expedited on a request regardless of its  ranking   within the order of receipt upon a showing of exceptional need or  urgency. Exceptional need or urgency is determined at the discretion of  the FOIA Coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon receipt of a properly submitted FOIA request, DCAA  organizational elements should contact the DCAA Information and Privacy  Advisor for a FOIA case number. IDAs should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Locate and assemble responsive records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determine releasability under the provisions of this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determine the appropriate fees to be charged and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Advise the requester accordingly. Initial determinations on  either the release or denial of records, and notice to requesters, must  be provided within 20 working days following receipt of the request by  the cognizant DCAA organizational element.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In certain cases, IDAs may need to exercise an extension to the  normal 20 working day period cited above. IDAs are to notify the  requester, within the initial 20 working day period, of the extension,  the circumstances necessitating it, and the anticipated date of a  determination. Approved extensions are not to exceed 10 working days,  and all extensions should be indicated on DCAA Form 5410-4, section 6.  Circumstances where such extensions may be approved include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The record(s) sought are geographically located at places other  than the DC+AA organizational element processing the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The request requires the collection and review of a substantial  number of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The disclosure determination requires consultation with another  DCAA organizational element or other Federal agency with a substantial  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an alternative to the previously mentioned, DCAA  organizational elements may seek informal agreements with requesters for  extensions in unusual circumstances when time limits become an issue in  the response to the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Misdirected requests should be referred within 20 working days  to the proper Federal agency or DCAA organizational elment through FOIA  channels, and the requester notified of the referral. The 20 working day  period allowed for responding to requests will not begin until the DCAA  organizational element having the responsive records receives the  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Initial disclosure determinations. (i) Initial determinations to  make records available may only be made by those IDAs designated in this  rule.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Requests for audit reports should be directed to the cognizant  contracting officer for release determination. (See Sec. 290.7(b)).   When a decision is made to release records in response to a FOIA  request, DCAA organizational elements will promptly make the records  available to the requester. When the request is for the examination of  releasable records, DCAA organizational elements will advise the  requester when and where he/she may appear. Examinations will be held  during normal business hours. If a record is not provided in response to  a FOIA request, the IDA will advise the requester, in writing, of the  rationale for not providing the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> IDAs should consult the Executive Officer, prior to releasing  records on matters considered newsworthy or when releasing records to  media representatives. Copies of all media requests should be submitted  to the Executive Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following reasons, other than the statutory exemptions  cited in the FOIA, are provided for not releasing a record in response  to a FOIA request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The request is transferred to another DoD component, or to  another Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Agency determines through knowledge of its files and  reasonable search efforts that it neither controls nor otherwise  possesses the requested record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A record has not been described with sufficient particularity to  enable the Agency to locate it by conducting a reasonable search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The requester has failed unreasonably to comply with procedural  requirements, including payment of fees, imposed by this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The request is withdrawn by the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The information requested is not a record within the meaning of  the FOIA and this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Denials. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A record in the possession and control of DCAA may  be withheld only when the record falls within one or more of the nine  categories of records exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA,  and the use of discretionary authority to release the record is  determined to be unwarranted. (Note: Since audit reports are prepared  for the use of DoD contracting officers, their release is at the  discretion of the DoD contracting activity. To facilitate an expeditious  response, requesters should send their requests directly to the DoD  contracting activity. (See Sec. 290.7(b)). The specific exemptions are  detailed in DCAAP 5410.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although exempt portions of records may be denied, nonexempt  portions must be released to the requester when it can reasonably be  assumed that the excised information could not be reconstructed. When a  record is denied in whole, based on distortion or reconstruction  potential, the IDA will prepare a response advising the requester of the  determination, and the response will specifically state that it is not  possible to reasonably segregate meaningful portions for release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the  IDA will inform the requester in writing of the specific exemption(s) on  which the denial is based and explain the determination in sufficient  detail to permit the requester to make a decision concerning appeal. The  determination will also inform the requester of his/her appeal rights.  All appeals should be made within 60 calendar days from the date of the  initial denial, contain the reasons for the requester's disagreement  with the determination, and be addressed to the Assistant Director,  Resources, Defense Contract Audit Agency, 8725 John J. Kingman Road,  Suite 2135, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6219.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Records or portions of records which have been previously  released become part of the public domain, and cannot be denied  thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Administrative Appeals of Denials. (i) If the IDA declines to  provide a record because he/she considers it exempt, that decision may  be appealed by the requester, in writing, to the Assistant Director,  Resources, DCAA.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Normally, IDAs would not issue denials for requests for audit  reports. The denial authority for such records generally rests with the  cognizant DoD contracting activity. (See Sec. 290.7(b)). The appeal  should be accompanied by a copy of the letter denying the initial  request. Such appeals should contain the basis for disagreement with the  initial refusal. Appeal procedures also apply to the disapproval of a  request for waiver or reduction of fees. A ``no record'' finding may be  appealed which allows the requester to challenge the adequacy of the  Agency's search. Records which are denied should be retained during the  time permitted for appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> IDAs shall advise the requester that an appeal should be filed  so that it reaches the designated appellate authority no later than 60  calendar days after the date of the initial denial letter. At the  conclusion of this period, except for good cause shown as to why the  appeal was not timely, the case may be considered closed; however, such  closure does not preclude the requester from filing litigation for  denial of his appeal. If the requester has been provided a series of  determinations for a single request, the time for appeal will begin on  the date of the last determination of the series. Records which are  denied shall be retained for a period of six years to meet the statute  of limitations of claims requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Final determinations normally shall be made within 20 working  days of receipt of an appropriately submitted appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Delay in responding to an appeal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When additional time is  required to respond to the appeal, the final determination may be  delayed for the number of working days (not to exceed 10 days) that were  not utilized as additional time for responding to the initial request.  Requesters shall be advised that, if the delay exceeds the statutory  extension provision or is for reasons other than the unusual  circumstances previously described, they may consider their  administrative remedies exhausted. They may, however, without  prejudicing their right of   judicial remedy, await a substantive response. DCAA shall continue to  process the case expeditiously, whether or not the requester seeks a  court order for release of the records, but a copy of any response  provided subsequent to filing a complaint shall be forwarded to the  Department of Justice through the DCAA General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the Assistant Director, Resources, DCAA, makes a  determination to release all or a portion of the records on appeal, the  records shall be made available promptly to the requester after  compliance with procedural requirements. The final denial of a request  will be made in writing, explain the exemption(s) invoked, advise that  the material being denied does not contain meaningful portions that are  reasonably segregable, and also advise the requester of the right of  judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Judicial action. A requester will be deemed to have exhausted  his administrative remedies after he has been denied the requested  record by the Assistant Director, Resources, or when the Agency fails to  respond to his request within the time limits prescribed by the FOIA and  this rule. The requester may then seek an order from a U.S. District  Court in the district in which he resides or has his principal place of  business; the district in which the record is situated; or in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia, enjoining the Agency from  withholding the record and ordering its production.
