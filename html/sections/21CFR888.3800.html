                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A wrist joint metal/polymer semi-constrained  cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a  wrist joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more  planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage  across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that  have either a one-part radial component made of alloys, such as cobalt- chromium-molybdenum, with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene  bearing surface, or a two-part radial   component made of alloys and an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene  ball that is mounted on the radial component with a trunnion bearing.  The metallic portion of the two-part radial component is inserted into  the radius. These devices have a metacarpal component(s) made of alloys,  such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. This generic type of device is  limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement (Sec.  888.3027).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II.</p>
