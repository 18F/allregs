                            <p class="depth0">A CDC may not transfer its certification or withdraw from the 504  program without SBA's consent. The CDC must provide a plan to SBA to  transfer its portfolio. The portfolio may only be transferred with SBA's  written consent. If a CDC desires to withdraw from the 504 program, it  must forfeit its portfolio to SBA. SBA may conduct an audit of the  transferring or withdrawing CDC.  [61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996.
