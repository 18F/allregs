                            <p class="depth0">No transfer of record title or of operating rights (sublease) shall be approved if the transferee or any other parties in interest are not qualified to hold the transferred interest(s), or if the bond, should one be required, is insufficient. Transfers are approved for administrative purposes only. Approval does not warrant or certify that either party to a transfer holds legal or equitable title to a lease.


Sec. 3106.7-2  If I transfer my lease, what is my continuing obligation?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You are responsible for performing all obligations under the lease until the date BLM approves an assignment of your record title interest or transfer of your operating rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After BLM approves the assignment or transfer, you will continue to be responsible for lease obligations that accrued before the approval date, whether or not they were identified at the time of the assignment or transfer. This includes paying compensatory royalties for drainage. It also includes responsibility for plugging wells and abandoning facilities you drilled, installed, or used before the effective date of the assignment or transfer.
[66 FR 1892, Jan. 10, 2001]



Sec. 3106.7-3  Lease account status.</p><p class="depth0">A transfer of record title or of operating rights (sublease) in a producing lease shall not be approved unless the lease account is in good standing.


Sec. 3106.7-4  Effective date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0">The signature of the authorized officer on the official form shall constitute approval of the transfer of record title or of operating rights (sublease) which shall take effect as of the first day of the lease month following the date of filing in the proper BLM office of all documents and statements required by this subpart and an appropriate bond, if one is required.


Sec. 3106.7-5  Effect of transfer.</p><p class="depth0">A transfer of record title to 100 percent of a portion of the lease segregates the transferred portion and the retained portion into separate leases. Each resulting lease retains the anniversary date and the terms and conditions of the original lease. A transfer of an undivided record title interest or a transfer of operating rights (sublease) shall not segregate the transferred and retained portions into separate leases.


Sec. 3106.7-6  If I acquire a lease by an assignment or transfer, what obligations do I agree to assume?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you acquire record title interest in a Federal lease, you agree to comply with the terms of the original lease during your lease tenure. You assume the responsibility to plug and abandon all wells which are no longer capable of producing, reclaim the lease site, and remedy all environmental problems in existence and that a purchaser exercising reasonable diligence should have known at the time. You must also maintain an adequate bond to ensure performance of these responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you acquire operating rights in a Federal lease, you agree to comply with the terms of the original lease as it applies to the area or horizons in which you acquired rights. You must plug and abandon all unplugged wells, reclaim the lease site, and remedy all environmental problems in existence and that a purchaser exercising reasonable diligence should have known at the time you receive the transfer. You must also maintain an adequate bond to ensure performance of these responsibilities.
