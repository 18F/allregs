                            <p class="depth0">The disposition of an appeal will be issued by the Solicitor of  Labor or designee in writing. A decision affirming, in whole or in part,  the decision below will include a brief statement of the reason or  reasons for the affirmance, including the FOIA exemption or exemptions  relied upon, and its relation to each record withheld, and a statement  that judicial review of the denial is available in the United States  District Court for the judicial district in which the requester resides  or maintains his or her principal place of business, the judicial  district in which the requested records are located, or the District of  Columbia. If it is determined on appeal that a record should be  disclosed, the record should be provided in accordance with the decision  on appeal. If it is determined that records should be denied in whole or  in part, the appeal determination will include an estimate of the volume  of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other  reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be  provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on  records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an  interest protected by an applicable exemption.</p>
