Such aircraft will experience delays while authorization for departure is obtained pursuant to this subpart and may, contrary to the other provisions of this subpart, be required, at the discretion of the approving authority, to pay a user fee of not less than $100. Before the aircraft is permitted to depart, the approving authority will require full compliance with this subpart 1204.14, including the filing of a complete report explaining the reasons for the unauthorized landing. Violators could also be subject to legal liability for unauthorized use. When it appears that the violation of this subpart was deliberate or is a repeated violation, the matter will be referred to the Aircraft Management Office, NASA Headquarters, which will then grant any departure authorization.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 15_Intergovernmental Review of National Aeronautics and Space</p><p class="depth0">Administration Programs and Activities</p><p class="depth0">Authority: E.O. 12372, July 14, 1982, 47 FR 30959, as amended April 8, 1983, 48 FR 15887; sec. 401 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, as amended (31 U.S.C. 6506).</p><p class="depth0">Source: 48 FR 29340, June 24, 1983, unless otherwise noted.</p>
