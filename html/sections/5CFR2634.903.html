                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> of this subpart, consult agency supplemental  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New entrants. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not later than 30 days after assuming a new  position or office described in Sec. 2634.904(a) of this subpart (which  also encompasses the reappointment or redesignation of a special  Government employee, including one who is serving on an advisory  committee), a confidential filer shall file a confidential report  containing the information prescribed in Secs. 2634.907 and 2634.908 of  this subpart. For confidential filers under Sec. 2634.904(a)(3) of this  subpart, consult agency supplemental regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, no report shall be required if the individual:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has, within 30 days prior to assuming his position, left another  position or office referred to in Sec. 2634.904(a) of this subpart or in  Sec. 2634.202, and has previously satisfied the reporting requirements  applicable to that former position, but a copy of the report filed by  the individual while in that position should be made available to the  appointing agency, and the individual must comply with any agency  requirement for a supplementary report for the new position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has already filed such a report in connection with  consideration for appointment to the position.

Additionally, a special Government  employee who has been appointed to serve on an advisory committee shall  file the required report before any advice is rendered by the employee  to the agency, or in no event, later than the first committee meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advisory committee definition.

Such term includes any  subcommittee or other subgroup of any advisory committee, but does not  include the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, the  Commission on Government Procurement, or any committee composed wholly  of full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extensions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agency extensions. The agency reviewing official  may, for good cause shown, grant to any employee or class of employees a  filing extension or several extensions totaling not more than 90 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain service during period of national emergency.
