                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contract types. The contracting agency shall use the following types of contracts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Project-specific. A contract between the contracting agency and consultant for the performance of services and defined scope of work related to a specific project or projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiphase. A project-specific contract where the solicited services are divided into phases whereby the specific scope of work and associated costs may be negotiated and authorized by phase as the project progresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On-call or indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ). A contract for the performance of services for a number of projects, under task or work orders issued on an as-needed or on-call basis, for an established contract period. The procurement of services to be performed under on-call or IDIQ contracts shall follow either competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement procedures, as specified in Sec. 172.7. The solicitation and contract provisions shall address the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specify a reasonable maximum length of contract period, including the number and period of any allowable contract extensions, which shall not exceed 5 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specify a maximum total contract dollar amount that may be awarded under a contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Include a statement of work, requirements, specifications, or other description to define the general scope, complexity, and professional nature of the services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If multiple consultants are to be selected and multiple on-call or IDIQ contracts awarded through a single solicitation for specific services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Identify the number of consultants that may be selected or contracts that may be awarded from the solicitation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Specify the procedures the contracting agency will use in competing and awarding task or work orders among the selected, qualified consultants. Task or work orders shall not be competed and awarded among the selected, qualified consultants on the basis of costs under on-call or IDIQ contracts for services procured with competitive negotiation procedures. Under competitive negotiation procurement, each specific task or work order shall be awarded to the selected, qualified consultants:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Through an additional qualifications-based selection procedure, which may include, but does not require, a formal RFP in accordance with Sec. 172.5(a)(1)(ii); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On a regional basis whereby the State is divided into regions and consultants are selected to provide on-call

or IDIQ services for an assigned region(s) identified within the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payment methods. (1) The method of payment to the consultant shall be set forth in the original solicitation, contract, and in any contract modification thereto. The methods of payment shall be: Lump sum, cost plus fixed fee, cost per unit of work, or specific rates of compensation. A single contract may contain different payment methods as appropriate for compensation of different elements of work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of payment shall not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The lump sum payment method shall only be used when the contracting agency has established the extent, scope, complexity, character, and duration of the work to be required to a degree that fair and reasonable compensation, including a fixed fee, can be determined at the time of negotiation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When the method of payment is other than lump sum, the contract shall specify a maximum amount payable which shall not be exceeded unless adjusted by a contract modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The specific rates of compensation payment method provides for reimbursement on the basis of direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates, including direct labor costs, indirect costs, and fee or profit, plus any other direct expenses or costs, subject to an agreement maximum amount. This payment method shall only be used when it is not possible at the time of procurement to estimate the extent or duration of the work or to estimate costs with any reasonable degree of accuracy. This specific rates of compensation payment method should be limited to contracts or components of contracts for specialized or support type services where the consultant is not in direct control of the number of hours worked, such as construction engineering and inspection. When using this payment method, the contracting agency shall manage and monitor the consultant's level of effort and classification of employees used to perform the contracted services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A contracting agency may withhold retainage from payments in accordance with prompt pay requirements, as specified in 49 CFR 26.29. When retainage is used, the terms and conditions of the contract shall clearly define agency requirements, including periodic reduction in retention and the conditions for release of retention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract provisions. (1) All contracts and subcontracts shall include the following provisions, either by reference or by physical incorporation into the language of each contract or subcontract, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where consultants violate or breach contract terms and conditions, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of contracting agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contracting agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Access by recipient, the subrecipient, FHWA, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the consultant which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Retention of all required records for not less than 3 years after the contracting agency makes final payment and all other pending matters are closed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Standard DOT Title VI Assurances (DOT Order 1050.2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) assurance, as specified in 49 CFR 26.13(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Prompt pay requirements, as specified in 49 CFR 26.29;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Determination of allowable costs in accordance with the Federal cost principles;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Contracting agency requirements pertaining to consultant errors and omissions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Contracting agency requirements pertaining to conflicts of interest, as specified in 23 CFR 1.33 and the requirements of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> A provision for termination for cause and termination for convenience

by the contracting agency including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All contracts and subcontracts exceeding $100,000 shall contain, either by reference or by physical incorporation into the language of each contract, a provision for lobbying certification and disclosure, as specified in 49 CFR part 20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contract administration and monitoring--(1) Responsible charge. A full-time, public employee of the contracting agency qualified to ensure that the work delivered under contract is complete, accurate, and consistent with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract shall be in responsible charge of each contract or project. While an independent consultant may be procured to serve in a program or project management support role, as specified in Sec. 172.7(b)(5), or to provide technical assistance in review and acceptance of engineering and design related services performed and products developed by other consultants, the contracting agency shall designate a public employee as being in responsible charge. A public employee may serve in responsible charge of multiple projects and contracting agencies may use multiple public employees to fulfill monitoring responsibilities. The term responsible charge is intended to be applied only in the context defined within this regulation. It may or may not correspond to its usage in State laws regulating the licensure and/or conduct of professional engineers. The public employee's responsibilities shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Administering inherently governmental activities including, but not limited to, contract negotiation, contract payment, and evaluation of compliance, performance, and quality of services provided by consultant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Being familiar with the contract requirements, scope of services to be performed, and products to be produced by the consultant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Being familiar with the qualifications and responsibilities of the consultant's staff and evaluating any requested changes in key personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Scheduling and attending progress and project review meetings, commensurate with the magnitude, complexity, and type of work, to ensure the work is progressing in accordance with established scope of work and schedule milestones;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ensuring consultant costs billed are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles and consistent with the contract terms as well as the acceptability and progress of the consultant's work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Evaluating and participating in decisions for contract modifications; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Documenting contract monitoring activities and maintaining supporting contract records, as specified in 2 CFR 200.333.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance evaluation. The contracting agency shall prepare an evaluation summarizing the consultant's performance on a contract. The performance evaluation should include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the timely completion of work, adherence to contract scope and budget, and quality of the work conducted. The contracting agency shall provide the consultant a copy of the performance evaluation and an opportunity to provide written comments to be attached to the evaluation. The contracting agency should prepare additional interim performance evaluations based on the scope, complexity, and size of the contract as a means to provide feedback, foster communication, and achieve desired changes or improvements. Completed performance evaluations should be archived for consideration as an element of past performance in the future evaluation of the consultant to provide similar services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Contract modification. (1) Contract modifications are required for any amendments to the terms of the existing contract that change the cost of the contract; significantly change the character, scope, complexity, or duration of the work; or significantly change the conditions under which the work is required to be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A contract modification shall clearly define and document the changes made to the contract, establish the method of payment for any adjustments in contract costs, and be in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract and original procurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A contracting agency shall negotiate contract modifications following the same procedures as the negotiation of the original contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A contracting agency may add to a contract only the type of services and work included within the scope of services of the original solicitation from which a qualifications-based selection was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For any additional engineering and design related services outside of the scope of work established in the original request for proposal, a contracting agency shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Procure the services under a new solicitation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Perform the work itself using contracting agency staff; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use a different, existing contract under which the services would be within the scope of work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Overruns in the costs of the work shall not automatically warrant an increase in the fixed fee portion of a cost plus fixed fee reimbursed contract. Permitted changes to the scope of work or duration may warrant consideration for adjustment of the fixed fee portion of cost plus fixed fee or lump sum reimbursed contracts.</p>
