                            <p class="depth0">Within 2 weeks after receipt of a written request from the borrower, the Agency must inform the borrower of the security and the total unpaid balance of the Agency indebtedness covered by the Financing Statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Agency fails to provide the information, it may be liable for any loss caused the borrower and, in some States, other parties, and also may lose some of its security rights. The UCC provides that the borrower is entitled to such information once every 6 months without charge, and the Agency may charge up to $10 for each additional statement. However, the Agency provides them without charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Although the UCC only requires the Agency to give information pursuant to the borrower's written request, the Agency will also answer oral requests. Furthermore, the UCC does not

prohibit giving this information to others who have a proper need for it, such as a bank or another creditor contemplating advancing additional credit to the borrower.
