An application for a stay shall be labeled as   such on the application and on the outside of the envelope in which the  application is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the  firm filing the application. It shall include a description of the  proceeding incident to which the stay is being sought and of the facts  and circumstances which support the applicant's claim that it will incur  irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted. The  applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated in 10  CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section. The  DOE on its own initiative may also issue an order granting a stay upon a  finding that a firm will incur irreparable injury if such an order is  not granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An order granting a stay shall expire by its terms within such  time after issuance, not to exceed 30 days as the DOE specifies in the  order, except that it shall expire automatically 5 days following its  issuance if the applicant fails within that period to file an  application for review unless within that period the DOE for good cause  shown, extends the time during which the applicant may file an  application for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The order granting or denying a stay is not an order of the DOE  subject to administrative review.</p>
