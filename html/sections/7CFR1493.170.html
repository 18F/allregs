The instrument must reference the applicable Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit and, if applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of each of the following documents:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and Ordinary Interest rates for each installment (if the Ordinary Interest rates for future payments are unknown at the time the claim for default is submitted, provide estimates of such rates);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> The Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit securing the export sale; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Foreign Financial Institution Letter of Credit securing the export sale; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If applicable, the Terms and Conditions Document;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Depending upon the method of shipment, the ocean carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, or, if shipped by rail or truck, the bill of lading and the entry certificate or similar document signed by an official of the importing country. If the transaction utilizes electronic bill(s) of lading (e-BL), a print-out of the e-BL from electronic system with an electronic signature is acceptable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)(A)</em> The Exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FCA, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FCA, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If there was an Intervening Purchaser, both the Exporter's invoice to the Intervening Purchaser and the Intervening Purchaser's invoice to the Importer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The evidence of export report(s) previously submitted by the Exporter to CCC in conformity with the requirements of Sec. 1493.130(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the defaulted payment was part of a transaction executed under a Repurchase Agreement, written evidence that the repurchase occurred as required under Sec. 1493.120(f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional documents.

CCC may establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a Payment Guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the Payment Guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.</p>
