                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A bond or other evidence of indebtedness  (hereinafter in this section referred to as an obligation) issued by any  person and payable on demand shall not be treated as an evidence of  indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to a sale or  other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or other casual  disposition of personal property. In addition, an obligation issued by a  corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With interest coupons attached (whether or not the obligation is  readily tradable in an established securities market),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In registered form (other than an obligation issued in  registered form which the taxpayer establishes will not be readily  tradable in an established securities market), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any other form designed to render such obligation readily  tradable in an established securities market shall not be treated as an  evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to  a sale or other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or  other casual disposition of personal property. For purposes of this  section, an obligation is to be considered in registered form if it is  registered as to principal, interest, or both and if its transfer must  be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the  reissuance by the corporation of the old instrument to the new holder or  the issuance by the corporation of a new instrument to the new holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> an obligation  is not treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser, then--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of determining whether the payments received in the  taxable year of the sale or disposition exceed 30 percent of the selling  price, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of returning income on the installment method  during the taxable year of the sale or disposition or in a subsequent  taxable year, the receipt by the seller of such obligation shall be  treated as a payment. The rules stated in this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25SE06.004</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On July 1, 1970, A, an individual on the cash method of  accounting reporting on a calendar year basis, transferred all of his  stock in corporation X (traded on an established securities market and  having a fair market value of $1 million) to corporation Y in exchange  for 250 of corporation Y's registered bonds (which are traded in an  over-the-counter bond market) each with a principal amount and fair  market value of $1,000 (with interest payable at the rate of 8 percent  per year), and Y's unsecured promissory note, with a principal amount of  $750,000. At the time of such exchange A's basis in the corporation X  stock is $900,000. The promissory note is payable at the rate of $75,000  annually, due on July 1, of each year following 1970, until the  principal balance is paid. The note provides for the payment of interest  at the rate of 10 percent per year also payable on July 1 of each year.  Under the rule stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the 250  registered bonds of corporation Y are treated as a payment for purposes  of the 30 percent test described in section 453(b)(2)(A)(ii). The  payment on account of the bonds equals 25 percent of the selling price  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Since the payments received in the taxable year of the sale do not  exceed 30 percent of the selling price and the sales price exceeds  $1,000, A may report the income received on the sale of his corporation  X stock on the installment method. A elects to report the income on the  installment method. The gross profit to be realized when the corporation  X stock is fully paid for is 10 percent of the total contract price,  computed as follows: $100,000 gross profit (i.e., $1 million contract  price less $900,000 basis in corporation X stock) over $1 million  contract price. However, since subparagraph (2) of this paragraph also  treats the 250 corporation Y registered bonds as a payment for purposes  of reporting income, A must include $25,000 (i.e., 10 percent times  $250,000) in his gross income for calendar year 1970, the taxable year  of sale.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further  that on July 1, 1971, corporation Y makes its first installment payment  to A under the terms of the unsecured promissory note with 75 more of  its $1,000 registered bonds. A must include $7,500 (i.e., 10 percent  gross profit percentage times $75,000) in his gross income for calendar  year 1971. In addition, A includes the interest payment made by  corporation Y on July 1, in his gross income for 1971.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payable on demand. Under section 453(b)(3), an obligation shall  be treated as payable on demand only if the obligation is treated as  payable on demand under applicable state or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Designed to be readily tradable in an established securities  market--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Obligations issued by a corporation or  government or political subdivision thereof will be deemed to be in a  form designed to render such obligations readily tradable in an  established securities market if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Steps necessary to create a market for them are taken at the  time of issuance (or later, if taken pursuant to an expressed or implied  agreement or understanding which existed at the time of issuance),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If they are treated as readily tradable in an established  securities market under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If they are convertible obligations to which paragraph (e) of  this section applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Readily tradable in an established securities market. An  obligation will be treated as readily tradable in an established  securities market if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The obligation is part of an issue or series of issues which are  readily tradable in an established securities market, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph, the determination  as to whether there exist obligations of a   comparable character depends upon the particular facts and  circumstances. Factors to be considered in making such determination  include, but are not limited to, substantial similarity with respect to  the presence and nature of security for the obligation, the number of  obligations issued (or to be issued), the number of holders of such  obligation, the principal amount of the obligation, and other relevant  factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Readily tradable. For purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this  paragraph, an obligation shall be treated as readily tradable if it is  regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such  obligation or is part of an issue a portion of which is in fact traded  in an established securities market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Established securities market. For purposes of this paragraph,  the term established securities market includes (i) a national  securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f), (ii) an exchange  which is exempted from registration under section 5 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 78e) because of its limited volume of  transactions, and (iii) any over-the-counter market. For purposes of  this subparagraph, an over-the-counter market is reflected by the  existence of an interdealer quotation system. An interdealer quotation  system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which  regularly disseminates quotations of obligations by identified brokers  or dealers, other than a quotation sheet prepared and distributed by a  broker or dealer in the regular course of his business and containing  only quotations of such broker or dealer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The rules stated in this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On June 1, 1971, 25 individuals owning equal interests in  a tract of land with a fair market value of $1 million sell the land to  corporation Y. The $1 million sales price is represented by 25 bonds  issued by corporation Y each having a face value of $40,000. The bonds  are not in registered form and do not have interest coupons attached,  and, in addition, are payable in 120 equal installments each due on the  first business day of each month. In addition, the bonds are negotiable  and may be assigned by the holder to any other person. However, the  bonds are not quoted by any brokers or dealers who deal in corporate  bonds, and, furthermore, there are no comparable obligations of  corporation Y (determined with reference to the characteristics set  forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) which are so quoted.  Therefore, the bonds are not treated as readily tradable in an  established securities market. In addition, under the particular facts  and circumstances stated, the bonds will not be considered to be in a  form designed to render them readily tradeable in an established  securities market. Since the bonds are not in registered form, do not  have coupons attached, are not in a form designed to render them readily  tradable in an established securities market, the receipt of such bonds  by the holder is not treated as a payment for purposes of section  453(b), notwithstanding that they are freely assignable.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. On April 1, 1972, corporation M purchases in a casual  sale of personal property a fleet of trucks from corporation N in  exchange for corporation M's negotiable notes, not in registered form  and without coupons attached. The corporation M notes are comparable to  earlier notes issued by corporation M, which notes are quoted in the  Eastern Bond section of the National daily quotation sheet, which is an  interdealer quotation system. Both issues of notes are unsecured, held  by more than 100 holders, have a maturity date of more than 5 years, and  were issued for a comparable principal amount. On the basis of these  similar characteristics it appears that the latest notes will also be  readily tradable. Since an interdealer system reflects an over-the- counter market, the earlier notes are treated as readily tradable in an  established securities market. Since the later notes are obligations  comparable to the earlier ones, which are treated as readily tradable in  an established securities market, the later notes are also treated as  readily tradable in an established securities market (whether or not  such notes are actually traded).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for convertible securities--(1) General rule. For  purposes of paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, if an obligation contains  a right whereby the holder of such obligation may convert it directly or  indirectly into another obligation which would be treated as a payment  under paragraph (b) of this section or may convert it directly or  indirectly into stock which would be treated as readily tradable or  designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market  under paragraph (d) of this section, the convertible obligation shall be  considered to be in a form designed to render such obligation   readily tradable in an established securities market unless such  obligation is convertible only at a substantial discount. In determining  whether the stock or obligation, into which an obligation is  convertible, is readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in  an established securities market, the rules stated in paragraph (d) of  this section shall apply, and for purposes of such paragraph (d) if such  obligation is convertible into stock then the term ``stock'' shall be  substituted for the term ``obligation'' wherever it appears in such  paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantial discount rule. Whether an obligation is convertible  at a substantial discount depends upon the particular facts and  circumstances. A substantial discount shall be considered to exist if at  the time the convertible obligation is issued, the fair market value of  the stock or obligation into which the obligation is convertible is less  than 80 percent of the fair market value of the obligation (determined  by taking into account all relevant factors, including proper discount  to reflect the fact that the convertible obligation is not readily  tradable in an established securities market and any additional  consideration required to be paid by the taxpayer). Also, if a privilege  to convert an obligation into stock or an obligation which is readily  tradable in an established securities market may not be exercised within  a period of 1 year from the date the obligation is issued, a substantial  discount shall be considered to exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section shall apply to  sales or other dispositions occurring after May 27, 1969, which are not  made pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before  such date. No inference shall be drawn from this section as to any  question of law concerning the application of section 453 to sales or  other dispositions occurring on or before May 27, 1969.
