                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial status conference. As soon as practicable after the  filing of the complaint and answer, the Board shall schedule an initial  status conference to discuss the issues of the case, the procedures  available under the Board's rules of resolution of the case, and a  tentative schedule for such resolution, including the plan for possible  discovery required by Rule 8(c), the possibility of alternative dispute  resolution (see Rule 24), and the possibility of dispositive motions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Status conferences and reports. At any time during the appeal,  the Board, upon its own initiative or upon the request of one of the  parties, may call upon the parties or their attorneys or representatives  to appear before the Board (or one or more members thereof) for a status  conference to consider or report on whatever matters are necessary to  aid in the disposition of the appeal. Such matters may include, for  example, the simplification or clarification of issues, the necessity or  desirability of amendments to the pleadings, agreements and rulings to  facilitate discovery, progress reports during discovery, and pre-hearing  procedures and scheduling. Status conferences may be conducted in person  or by telephone, and the Board generally will make an order which  recites the action taken at the conference(s). From time to time, the  Board also may require one or more of the parties, either jointly or  individually, to provide status reports concerning any matter that aids  in the disposition of the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rulings, orders, and directions. The Board may make such rulings  and issue such orders and directions as are necessary to secure the  informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of every case before  the Board. Any ruling, order, or direction that the Board may make or  issue pursuant to the rules of this Board may be made on the motion of  any party or on the initiative of the Board. The Board may also amend,  alter, or vacate a ruling, order, or direction upon such terms as it  deems appropriate. In making rulings and issuing orders and directions,  the Board will take into consideration those Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure   and Federal Rules of Evidence which address matters not specifically  covered herein.
