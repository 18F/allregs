You may include more than one mining claim in one deferment petition if the claims are contiguous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If BLM grants you a deferment, you have merely deferred doing the assessment work. You still must complete that assessment work for that assessment year after the deferment period ends, as provided in Sec. 3836.27.</p>
