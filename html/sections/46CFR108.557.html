If the means provided to secure the lifeboat cannot be released from inside the lifeboat, the means to secure the lifeboat must be arranged as to preclude boarding the lifeboat without first releasing it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each free-fall launching arrangement must be provided with a secondary means to launch the lifeboat by falls. Such means must comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec.  108.550, 108.553, and 108.555. Notwithstanding Sec.  108.550(e), the launching appliance must be capable of launching the lifeboat against unfavorable conditions of list of 5 degrees in any direction and it need not comply with the speed requirements of Sec. Sec.  108.553 (g), (h), and (i).</p><p class="depth2">If the secondary launching appliance is not dependent on gravity, stored mechanical power or other manual means, the launching arrangement must be connected both to the unit's main and emergency power supplies.</p>
