The certificate of conformity is valid for each engine family starting with the indicated effective date, but it is not valid for any production after December 31 of the model year for which it is issued. The certificate of conformity is valid upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that the production engines covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificates were issued were satisfied or excused.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificates were issued were satisfied or excused.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will determine whether the test data included in the application represents all engines of the engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the fact that any engine(s) may comply with other provisions of this subpart, the Administrator may withhold or deny the issuance of any certificate of conformity, or suspend or revoke any such certificate(s) which has (have) been issued with respect to any such engine(s) if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in its application for certification thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which it submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act, or of this part with respect to such engine;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms specified in Sec. 94.215 to any facility or portion thereof which contains any of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An engine which is scheduled to undergo emissions testing, or which is undergoing emissions testing, or which has undergone emissions testing; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any components used or considered for use in the construction, modification or buildup of any engine which is scheduled to undergo emissions testing, or which is undergoing emissions

testing, or which has undergone emissions testing for purposes of emissions certification; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any production engine which is or will be claimed by the manufacturer to be covered by the certificate; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any step in the construction of the engine; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Any records, documents, reports or histories required by this part to be kept concerning any of the items listed in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied ``reasonable assistance'' (as defined in Sec. 94.215).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submits false or inaccurate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In any case in which certification of an engine is to be withheld, denied, revoked or suspended under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and in which the Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of Sec. 94.215 in fact occurred, the manufacturer, if it wishes to contend that, even though the violation occurred, the engine in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant withholding, denial, revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any revocation, suspension, or voiding of certification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 94.216; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of engines previously covered by the certification which are still in the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other misconduct that makes the certification invalid ab initio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The manufacturer may request, within 30 days of receiving notification, that any determination made by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to withhold or deny certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 94.216.

If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a

substantial factual issue, the manufacturer shall be provided with a hearing in accordance with Sec. 94.216 with respect to such issue.
