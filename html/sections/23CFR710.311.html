                            <p class="depth0">The State must manage real property acquired for a project until it is required for construction. Clearance of improvements can be scheduled during the acquisition phase of the project using sale/removal agreements, separate demolition contracts, or be included as a work item in the construction contract. On Interstate projects, prior to advertising for construction, the State shall develop ROW availability statements and certifications related to project acquisitions as required by 23 CFR 635.309. For non-Interstate projects, the oversight agreement must specify responsibility for the review and approval of the ROW availability statements and certifications. Generally, for non-NHS projects, the State has full responsibility for determining that right-of-way is available for construction.</p>
