                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Computation of PEL. The PEL is calculated in terms of PUM cost  and represents the costs associated with the project, except for utility  and add-on costs. Costs associated with the PEL are administration,  management fees, maintenance, protective services, leasing, occupancy,  staffing, and other expenses, such as project insurance. HUD will  calculate the PEL using regression analysis and benchmarking for the  actual costs of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) projects to  estimate costs for public housing projects. HUD will use the ten  variables described in paragraph (b) of this section and their  associated coefficient (i.e., values that are expressed in percentage  terms) to produce a PEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Variables. The ten variables are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Size of project (number of units);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Age of property (Date of Full Availability (DOFA));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bedroom mix;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Building type;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Occupancy type (family or senior);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Location (an indicator of the type of community in which a  property is located; location types include rural, city central  metropolitan, and non-city central metropolitan (suburban) areas);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Neighborhood poverty rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Percent of households assisted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Ownership type (profit, non-profit, or limited dividend); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Geographic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost adjustments. HUD will apply four adjustments to the PEL.  The adjustments are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application of a $200 PUM floor for any senior property and a  $215 PUM floor for any family property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of a $420 PUM ceiling for any property except for  New York City Housing Authority projects, which have a $480 PUM ceiling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application of a four percent reduction for any PEL calculated  over $325 PUM, with the reduction limited so that a PEL will not be  reduced to less than $325; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reduction of audit costs as reported for FFY 2003 in a PUM  amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annual inflation factor. The PEL for each project shall be  adjusted annually, beginning in 2005, by the local inflation factor. The  local inflation factor shall be the HUD-determined weighted average  percentage increase in local government wages and salaries for the area  in which the PHA is located, and non-wage expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculating a PEL. To calculate a specific PEL for a given  property, the sum of the coefficients for nine variables (all variables  except ownership type) shall be added to a formula constant. The  exponent of that sum shall be multiplied by a percentage to reflect the  non-profit ownership type, which will produce an unadjusted PEL. For the  calculation of the initial PEL, the cost adjustments described in  paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section will be applied.  After these initial adjustments are applied, the audit adjustment  described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section will be applied to arrive  at the PEL in year 2000 dollars. After the PEL in year 2000 dollars is  created, the annual inflation factor as described in paragraph (d) of  this section will be applied cumulatively to this number through 2004 to  yield an initial PEL in terms of current dollars.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculation of the PEL for Moving to Work PHAs. PHAs  participating in the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration authorized under  section 204 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations  Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) shall receive an  operating subsidy as provided in Attachment A of their MTW Agreements  executed prior to November 18, 2005. PHAs with an MTW Agreement will  continue to have the   right to request extensions of or modifications to their MTW Agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Calculation of the PELs for mixed-finance developments. If,  prior to November 18, 2005, a PHA has either a mixed-finance arrangement  that has closed or has filed documents in accordance with 24 CFR 941.606  for a mixed-finance transaction, then the project covered by the mixed- finance transaction will receive funding based on the higher of its  former Allowable Expense Level or the new computed PEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Calculation of PELs when data are inadequate or unavailable.  When sufficient data are unavailable for the calculation of a PEL, HUD  may calculate a PEL using an alternative methodology. The  characteristics may be used from similarly situated properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review of PEL methodology by advisory committee. In 2009, HUD  will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders,  to review the methodology to evaluate the PEL based on actual cost data.  The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory  Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). HUD may determine appropriate  funding levels for each project to be effective in FY 2011 after  following appropriate rulemaking procedures.</p>
