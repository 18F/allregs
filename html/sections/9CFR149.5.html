                                Sec. 149.5  Offsite identification and segregation of certified swine.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Certified swine moved from a certified production site to another  location, whether to another certified production site, buying station,  collection point, or slaughter facility, must remain segregated from  noncertified swine at all times and otherwise maintain their identity as  certified swine in such a way that they could be readily traced back to  the certified production site from which they came. Information relating  to the identification of the certified swine must be documented in the  animal movement record maintained by the producer. Failure to properly  segregate or maintain the identity of certified swine from noncertified  swine after leaving the certified production site will result in the  loss of certified status for that shipment of swine.</p>
