                            <p class="depth0">The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet  has not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in  animal feed. Use of gentian violet in animal feed causes the feed to be  adulterated and in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (the act), in the absence of a regulation providing for its safe use as  a food additive under section 409 of the act, unless it is subject to an  effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food  additive under Sec. 570.17 of this chapter, or unless the substance is  intended for use as a new animal drug and is subject to an approved  application under section 512 of the act, or an index listing under  section 572 of the act, or an effective notice of claimed  investigational exemption for a new animal drug under part 511 of this  chapter or Sec. 516.125 of this chapter.
