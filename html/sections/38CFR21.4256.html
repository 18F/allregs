                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval of correspondence programs and courses. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  educational institution desiring to enroll veterans under 38 U.S.C.  chapter 30 or 32, spouses and/or surviving spouses under 38 U.S.C.  chapter 35, and/or reservists under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 in a program  of education to be pursued exclusively by correspondence, or in the  correspondence portion of a combination correspondence-residence course,  may have the program or course approved only when the educational  institution meets the requirements of Sec. Sec. 21.4252(e), 21.4253,  and 21.4279, as applicable.  (The information collection requirements in this section have been  approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2900-0575)   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672(e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of an educational institution for approval of a  program of education to be pursued exclusively by correspondence or the  correspondence portion of a combined correspondence-residence course  must demonstrate that the program or course is satisfactory in all  elements. The educational institution must certify to the State  approving agency that at least 50 percent of those pursuing the program  or course require six months or more to complete it. For applications  for approval that are pending approval by the State approving agency on  February 2, 1995, and for applications received by the State approving  agency after that date, the required certification shall be based on the  experience of students who completed the program or course during the  six-month period immediately preceding the educational institution's  application for approval.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672(e))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State approving agencies have the authority to review  periodically the length of time needed to complete each approved  correspondence program or approved correspondence-residence course in  order to determine whether the program or course should continue to be  approved. In implementing this authority, a State approving agency will  examine the results over a prior two-year period reasonably related to  the date on which such a review is conducted.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672(e))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>; 38 U.S.C. 3686(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, 3686(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the agreement shall be given to the veteran, spouse,  surviving spouse, or reservist when it is signed.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agreement shall not be effective unless the veteran, spouse,  surviving spouse, or reservist after the expiration of 10 days after the  agreement is signed, shall have signed and submitted to VA a written  statement, with a signed copy to the institution, specifically affirming  the agreement.  (The information collection requirements in this section have been  approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2900-0576)   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(b))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mandatory refund policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon notification of the  educational institution by the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or  reservist of an intention not to affirm the enrollment agreement, any  fees paid by the individual shall be returned promptly in full to him or  her.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(c))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon termination of enrollment under an affirmed enrollment  agreement for training in the accredited course by the veteran, spouse,  surviving spouse, or reservist, without having completed any lessons, a  registration fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the  course or $50, whichever is less, may be charged him or her. When the  individual terminates the agreement after completion of less than 25  percent of the lessons of the course, the institution may retain the  registration fee plus 25 percent of the tuition. When the individual  terminates the agreement after completing 25 percent but less than 50  percent of the lessons, the institution may retain the registration fee  plus 50 percent of the tuition for the course. If 50 percent or more of  the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(c))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the school either has or adopts an established policy for  the refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges  subject to proration, which is more favorable to the veteran, spouse,  surviving spouse, or reservist than the pro rata basis as provided in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such established policy will be  applicable.   (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(c))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any institution that fails to forward any refund due to the  veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist within 40 days after  receipt of a notice of termination or disaffirmance, shall be deemed,  prima facie, to have failed to make a prompt refund as required by this  section.
