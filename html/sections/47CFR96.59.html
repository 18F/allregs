All such determinations and assignments shall be made in a non-discriminatory manner, consistent with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon request from the Commission or a CBSD, an SAS must confirm whether frequencies are available in a given geographic area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon request from the Commission, an SAS must confirm that CBSDs in a given geographic area and frequency band have been shut down or moved to another available frequency range in response to information received from the ESC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an SAS provides a range of available frequencies or channels to a CBSD, it may require that CBSD to confirm which channel or range of frequencies it will utilize.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with the requirements of Sec. 96.25, an SAS shall assign geographically contiguous PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee to the same channels in each geographic area, where feasible. The SAS shall also assign multiple channels held by the same Priority Access Licensee to contiguous frequencies within the same License Area, where feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An SAS may temporarily assign PALs to different channels (within the frequency range authorized for Priority Access use) to protect Incumbent Access Users or if necessary to perform its required functions.</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 80 FR 36222, June 23, 2015, Sec. 96.59 was added, however, paragraph (a) contains information collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
