                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In drilling operations in fields where high pressures, lost circulation, or other conditions exist which could result in blowouts, the lessee must install an approved gate valve or other controlling device in proper working condition for use until the well is completed. At all times, preventative measures must be taken in all well operations to maintain proper control of subsurface strata.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drilling wells. The lessee must take all necessary precautions to keep each well under control at all times, and must utilize and maintain materials and equipment necessary to insure the safety of operating conditions and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vertical drilling. The lessee must conduct drilling operations in a manner so that the completed well does not deviate significantly from the vertical without the prior written approval of the Superintendent. Significant deviation means a projected deviation of the well bore from the vertical of 10 deg. or more, or a projected bottom hole location which could be less than 200 feet from the spacing unit or lease boundary. Any well which deviates more than 10 deg. from the vertical or could result in a bottom hole location less than 200 feet from the spacing unit or lease boundary without prior written approval must be reported promptly to the Superintendent. In these cases, a directional survey is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> High pressure or loss of circulation. The lessee must take immediate steps and utilize necessary resources to maintain or restore control of any well in which the pressure equilibrium has become unbalanced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protection of fresh water and other minerals. The lessee must isolate freshwater-bearing and other usable water containing 5,000 ppm or less of dissolved solids and other mineral-bearing formations and protect them from contamination. Tests and surveys of the effectiveness of such measures must be conducted by the lessee using procedures and practices approved or prescribed by the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The lessee must conduct activities in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in Bureau of Land Management Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 6, Hydrogen Sulfide Operations.</p>
