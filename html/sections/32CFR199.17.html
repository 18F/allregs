                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The TRICARE program implements management improvements primarily through managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers. Implementation of these management improvements includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Statutory authority. Many of the provisions of this section are authorized by statutory authorities other than those which authorize the usual operation of the CHAMPUS program, especially 10 U.S.C. 1079 and 1086. The TRICARE program also relies upon other available statutory authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 1099 (health care enrollment system), 10 U.S.C. 1097 (contracts for medical care for retirees, dependents and survivors: alternative delivery of health care), and 10 U.S.C. 1096 (resource sharing agreements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Scope of the program. The TRICARE program is applicable to all of the uniformed services. Its geographical applicability is to all 50 states (except as modified for the state of Alaska under paragraph (v) of this section) and the District of Columbia. In such cases, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to TRICARE program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the area involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> MTF rules and procedures affected. Much of this section relates to rules and procedures applicable to the delivery and financing of health care services provided by civilian providers outside military treatment facilities. This section provides that certain rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth elsewhere in this part (and usually applicable to CHAMPUS) are different under the TRICARE program. In addition, some rules, procedures, rights and obligations relating to health care services in military treatment facilities are also different under the TRICARE program. In such cases, provisions of this section take precedence and are binding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Implementation based on local action. The TRICARE program is not automatically implemented in all areas where it is potentially applicable. Therefore, provisions of this section are not automatically implemented, Rather, implementation of the TRICARE program and this section requires an official action by an authorized individual, such as a military medical treatment facility commander, a Surgeon General, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), or other person authorized by the Assistant Secretary. Public notice of the initiation of the TRICARE program will be achieved through appropriate communication and media methods and by way of an official announcement by the Director, OCHAMPUS, identifying the military medical treatment facility catchment area or other geographical area covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Major features of the TRICARE program. The major features of the TRICARE program, described in this section, include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Comprehensive enrollment system. Under the TRICARE program, all health care beneficiaries become classified into one of four categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Active duty members, all of whom are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> TRICARE Prime enrollees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> TRICARE Standard participants, who are all CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Non-CHAMPUS beneficiaries, who are beneficiaries eligible for health care services in military treatment facilities, but not eligible for CHAMPUS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishment of a triple option benefit. A second major feature of TRICARE is the establishment of three options for receiving health care:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> ``TRICARE Prime,'' which is a health maintenance organization (HMO)-like program. It generally features use of military treatment facilities and substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for CHAMPUS care. Beneficiaries generally agree to use military treatment facilities and designated civilian provider networks and to follow certain managed care rules and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> ``TRICARE Extra,'' which is a preferred provider organization (PPO) program. It allows TRICARE Standard beneficiaries to use the TRICARE provider network, including both military facilities and the civilian network, with reduced out-of-pocket costs. These beneficiaries also continue to be eligible for military medical treatment facility care on a space-available basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ``TRICARE Standard'' which is the basic CHAMPUS program. All eligible beneficiaries are automatically included in Standard unless they have enrolled in Prime. It preserves broad freedom of choice of civilian providers, but does not offer reduced out-of-pocket costs. These beneficiaries continue to be eligible to receive care in military medical treatment facilities on a space available basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Coordination between military and civilian health care delivery systems. A third major feature of the TRICARE program is a series of activities affecting all beneficiary enrollment categories, designed to coordinate care between military and civilian health care systems. These activities include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Resource sharing agreements, under which a TRICARE contractor provides to a military medical treatment facility, personnel and other resources to increase the availability of services in the facility. All beneficiary enrollment categories may benefit from this increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Health care finder, an administrative activity that facilitates referrals to appropriate health care services in the military facility and civilian provider network. All beneficiary enrollment categories may use the health care finder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Integrated quality and utilization management services, potentially standardizing reviews for military and civilian sector providers. All beneficiary categories may benefit from these services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consolidated schedule of charges. A fourth major feature of TRICARE is a consolidated schedule of charges, incorporating revisions that reduce differences in charges between military and civilian services. In general, the TRICARE program reduces out-of-pocket costs for civilian sector care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Preemption of State laws. (i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE regional contracts. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE regional contracts. (However, the Department of Defense

may by contract establish legal obligations of the part of TRICARE contractors to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Triple option benefit in general. Where the TRICARE program is fully implemented, eligible beneficiaries are given the option of enrolling in TRICARE Prime (also referred to as ``Prime'') or remaining in TRICARE Standard (also referred to as ``Standard''). In the absence of an enrollment in Prime, coverage under Standard is automatic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Choice voluntary. With the exception of active duty members, the choice of whether to enroll in Prime is voluntary for all eligible beneficiaries. For dependents who are minors, the choice will be exercised by a parent or guardian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Active duty members. For active duty members located in areas where the TRICARE program is implemented, enrollment in Prime is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Automatic enrollment of certain dependents: Under 10 U.S.C. 1097a, in the case of dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4, such dependents who reside in a catchment area of a military treatment facility shall be enrolled in TRICARE Prime consistent with procedures established under paragraph (o)(7) of this section. The enrollment of a dependent of the member may be terminated by the member, dependent or other responsible individual at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility for enrollment. Where the TRICARE program is fully implemented, all CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries who are not Medicare eligible on the basis of age are eligible to enroll in Prime or to remain covered under Standard. CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare on basis of age (and are enrolled in Medicare Part B) are automatically covered under TRICARE Standard. Further, some rules and procedures are different for dependents of active duty members and retirees, dependents, and survivors. In addition, where the TRICARE program is implemented, a military medical treatment facility commander or other authorized individual may establish priorities, consistent with paragraph (c) of this section, based on availability or other operational requirements, for when and whether to offer enrollment in Prime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Active duty members. Active duty members are required to enroll in Prime when it is offered. Active duty members shall have first priority for enrollment in Prime. Because active duty members are not CHAMPUS eligible, when active duty members obtain care from civilian providers outside the military medical treatment facility, the supplemental care program and its requirements (including Sec. 199.16) will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dependents of active duty members. (i) Dependents of active duty members are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled, those dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4 will have second priority and all other dependents of active duty members will have third priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dependents of active duty members are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled, those dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4 will have second priority and all other dependents of active duty members will have third priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If all dependents of active duty members within the area concerned cannot be accepted for enrollment in Prime at the same time, the MTF Commander (or other authorized individual) may establish priorities within this beneficiary group category. The

priorities may be based on first-come, first-served, or alternatively, be based on rank of sponsor, beginning with the lowest pay grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Survivors of deceased members. (i) The spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days is eligible to enroll in Prime for a 3 year period beginning on the date of the member's death. For the three year period, surviving spouses of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days are subject to the same rules and provisions as dependents of active duty members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days is eligible to enroll in Prime for a 3 year period beginning on the date of the member's death. For the three year period, surviving spouses of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days are subject to the same rules and provisions as dependents of active duty members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A dependent child or unmarried person (as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)) of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001, is eligible to enroll in Prime and is subject to the same rules and provisions as dependents of active duty members for a period of three years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Attains 21 years of age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors. (i) Where TRICARE is fully implemented, all CHAMPUS-eligible retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors who are not eligible for Medicare on the basis of age are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled and availability of enrollment is assured for all active duty dependents wishing to enroll, this category of beneficiaries will have third priority for enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where TRICARE is fully implemented, all CHAMPUS-eligible retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors who are not eligible for Medicare on the basis of age are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled and availability of enrollment is assured for all active duty dependents wishing to enroll, this category of beneficiaries will have third priority for enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If all eligible retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors within the area concerned cannot be accepted for enrollment in Prime at the same time, the MTF Commander (or other authorized individual) may allow enrollment within this beneficiary group category on a first come, first served basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coverage under Standard. All CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries who do not enroll in Prime will remain in Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Health benefits under Prime. Health benefits under Prime, set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, differ from those under Extra and Standard, set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Military treatment facility (MTF) care--(i) In general. All participants in Prime are eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities. Participants in Prime will be given priority for such care over other beneficiaries. Among the following beneficiary groups, access priority for care in military treatment facilities where TRICARE is implemented as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. All participants in Prime are eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities. Participants in Prime will be given priority for such care over other beneficiaries. Among the following beneficiary groups, access priority for care in military treatment facilities where TRICARE is implemented as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Active duty service members;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of service members who died on active duty, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Retirees, their dependents and survivors, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of service members who died on active duty, who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Retirees, their dependents and survivors who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), survivors of members who died while on active duty are considered as among dependents of active duty service members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special provisions. Enrollment in Prime does not affect access priority for care in military treatment facilities for several miscellaneous beneficiary groups and special circumstances. Those include Secretarial designees, NATO and other foreign military personnel and dependents authorized care through international agreements, civilian employees under workers' compensation programs or under safety programs, members on the Temporary Disability Retired List (for statutorily required periodic medical examinations), members of the reserve

components not on active duty (for covered medical services), military prisoners, active duty dependents unable to enroll in Prime and temporarily away from place of residence, and others as designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Additional exceptions to the normal Prime enrollment access priority rules may be granted for other categories of individuals, eligible for treatment in the MTF, whose access to care is necessary to provide an adequate clinical case mix to support graduate medical education programs or readiness-related medical skills sustainment activities, to the extent approved by the ASD(HA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-MTF care for active duty members. Under Prime, non-MTF care needed by active duty members continues to be arranged under the supplemental care program and subject to the rules and procedures of that program, including those set forth in Sec. 199.16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Benefits covered for CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries for civilian sector care. The provisions of Sec. 199.18 regarding the Uniform HMO Benefit apply to TRICARE Prime enrollees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Health benefits under the TRICARE extra plan. Beneficiaries not enrolled in Prime, although not in general required to use the Prime civilian preferred provider network, are eligible to use the network on a case-by-case basis under Extra. The health benefits under Extra are identical to those under Standard, set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, except that the CHAMPUS cost sharing percentages are lower than usual CHAMPUS cost sharing. The lower requirements are set forth in the consolidated schedule of charges in paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Health benefits under the TRICARE standard plan. Where the TRICARE program is implemented, health benefits under Prime, set forth under paragraph (d) of this section, and Extra, set forth under paragraph (e) of this section, are different than health benefits under Standard, set forth in this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Military treatment facility (MTF) care. All nonenrollees (including beneficiaries not eligible to enroll) continue to be eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities on a space available basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Freedom of choice of civilian provider. Except as stated in Sec. 199.4(a) in connection with nonavailability statement requirements, CHAMPUS-eligible participants in Standard maintain their freedom of choice of civilian provider under CHAMPUS. All nonavailability statement requirements of Sec. 199.4(a) apply to Standard participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> CHAMPUS benefits apply. The benefits, rules and procedures of the CHAMPUS basis program as set forth in this part, shall apply to CHAMPUS-eligible participants in Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Preferred provider network option for standard participants. Standard participants, although not generally required to use the TRICARE program preferred provider network are eligible to use the network on a case-by-case basis, under Extra.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members--(1) In general. In geographic areas in which TRICARE Prime is not offered and in which eligible family members reside, there is offered under 10 U.S.C. 1079(p) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members as an enrollment option. TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members (TPRADFM) will generally follow the rules and procedures of TRICARE Prime, except as provided in this paragraph (g) and otherwise except to the extent the Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines them to be infeasible because of the remote area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In geographic areas in which TRICARE Prime is not offered and in which eligible family members reside, there is offered under 10 U.S.C. 1079(p) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members as an enrollment option. TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members (TPRADFM) will generally follow the rules and procedures of TRICARE Prime, except as provided in this paragraph (g) and otherwise except to the extent the Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines them to be infeasible because of the remote area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Active duty family member. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term ``active duty family member'' means one of the following dependents of an active duty member of the Uniformed Services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Spouse, child, or unmarried person, as defined in paragraphs Sec. 199.3 (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iv);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a 3-year period, the surviving spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The surviving dependent child or unmarried person, as defined in paragraphs Sec. 199.3 (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iv), of a member who dies while on active duty

for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001. Active duty family member status is for a period of 3 years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Attains 21 years of age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Eligibility. (i) An active duty family member is eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members if he or she is eligible for CHAMPUS and, on or after December 2, 2003, meets the criteria of (g)(3)(i)(A) and (g)(3)(i)(B) or (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section or on or after October 7, 2001, meets the criteria of (g)(3)(i)(D) or (g)(3)(i)(E) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An active duty family member is eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members if he or she is eligible for CHAMPUS and, on or after December 2, 2003, meets the criteria of (g)(3)(i)(A) and (g)(3)(i)(B) or (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section or on or after October 7, 2001, meets the criteria of (g)(3)(i)(D) or (g)(3)(i)(E) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The family member's active duty sponsor has been assigned permanent duty as a recruiter; as an instructor at an educational institution, an administrator of a program, or to provide administrative services in support of a program of instruction for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; as a full-time adviser to a unit of a reserve component; or any other permanent duty designated by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity that the Director determines is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military treatment facility that is adequate to provide care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The family members and active duty sponsor, pursuant to the assignment of duty described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section, reside at a location designated by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, that the Director determines is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military medical treatment facility adequate to provide care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The family member, having resided together with the active duty sponsor while the sponsor served in an assignment described in (g)(3)(i)(A), continues to reside at the same location after the sponsor relocates without the family member pursuant to orders for a permanent change of duty station, and the orders do not authorize dependents to accompany the sponsor to the new duty station at the expense of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For a 3 year period, the surviving spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The surviving dependent child or unmarried person as defined in paragraphs Sec. 199.3 (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iv), of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001, for three years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attains 21 years of age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A family member who is a dependent of a reserve component member is eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members if he or she is eligible for CHAMPUS and meets all of the following additional criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The reserve component member has been ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The family member resides with the member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, determines the residence of the reserve component member is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military medical treatment facility that is adequate to provide care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> ``Resides with'' is defined as the TRICARE Prime Remote residence address at which the family resides with the activated reservist upon activation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Enrollment.

The additional health care management requirements applicable to Prime enrollees under paragraph (n) of this section are applicable under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members unless the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines they are infeasible because of the particular remote location. Enrollees will be given notice of the applicable management requirements in their remote location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cost sharing. Beneficiary cost sharing requirements under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members are the same as those under TRICARE Prime under paragraph (m) of this section, except that the higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall not apply to routine primary health care services in cases in which, because of the remote location, the beneficiary is not assigned a primary care manager or the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines that care from a TRICARE network provider is not available within the TRICARE access standards under paragraph (p)(5) of this section. The higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall apply to specialty health care services received by any TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee unless an appropriate referral/preauthorization is obtained as required by section (n) under TRICARE Prime. In the case of pharmacy services under Sec. 199.21, where the Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines that no TRICARE network retail pharmacy has been established within a reasonable distance of the residence of the TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee, cost sharing applicable to TRICARE network retail pharmacies will be applicable to all CHAMPUS eligible pharmacies in the remote area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Resource sharing agreements. Under the TRICARE program, any military medical treatment facility (MTF) commander may establish resource sharing agreements with the applicable managed care support contractor for the purpose of providing for the sharing of resources between the two parties. Internal resource sharing and external resource sharing agreements are authorized. The provisions of this paragraph (h) shall apply to resource sharing agreements under the TRICARE program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In connection with internal resource sharing agreements, beneficiary cost sharing requirements shall be the same as those applicable to health care services provided in facilities of the uniformed services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under internal resource sharing agreements, the double coverage requirements of Sec. 199.8 shall be replaced by the Third Party Collection procedures of 32 CFR part 220, to the extent permissible under such part. In such a case, payments made to a resource sharing agreement provider through the TRICARE managed care support contractor shall be deemed to be payments by the MTF concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Under internal or external resource sharing agreements, the commander of the MTF concerned may authorize the provision of services, pursuant to the agreement, to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, if such services are not reimbursable by Medicare, and if the commander determines that this will promote the most cost-effective provision of services under the TRICARE program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Health care finder. The Health Care Finder is an administrative activity that assists beneficiaries in being referred to appropriate health care providers, especially the MTF and preferred providers. Health Care Finder services are available to all beneficiaries. In the case of TRICARE Prime enrollees, the Health Care Finder will facilitate referrals in accordance with Prime rules and procedures.

For Standard participants, the Finder will provide assistance for use of Extra. For Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, the Finder will facilitate referrals to TRICARE network providers, generally required to be Medicare participating providers. For participants in other managed care programs, the Finder will assist in referrals pursuant to the arrangements made with the other managed care program. For all beneficiary enrollment categories, the finder will assist in obtaining access to available services in the medical treatment facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> General quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements under TRICARE program. All quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see especially applicable provisions of Secs. 199.4 and 199.15), are applicable to Prime, Extra and Standard under the TRICARE program. Under all three options, some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program in areas in which the TRICARE program has not been implemented. Pursuant to an agreement between a military medical treatment facility and TRICARE managed care support contractor, quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements and procedures applicable to health care services outside the military medical treatment facility may be made applicable, in whole or in part, to health care services inside the military medical treatment facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Pharmacy services. Pharmacy services under Prime are as provided in the Pharmacy benefits Program (see Sec. 199.21).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics--(1) Description and authority. PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics are contractor owned, staffed, and operated clinics that exclusively serve uniformed services beneficiaries. They are authorized as transitional entities during the phase-in of TRICARE. This authority to operate a PRIMUS or NAVCARE clinic will cease upon implementation of TRICARE in the clinic's location, or on October 1, 1997, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Description and authority.

Some health care services subsequent to consultation appointments (invasive procedures, nonemergent admissions and other health care services as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee) will require medical necessity preauthorization. Though referrals for specialty care are generally the responsibility of the primary care managers, subject to discretion exercised by the TRICARE Regional Directors, and established in regional policy or memoranda of understanding, specialist providers may be permitted to refer patients for additional specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network without prior authorization by primary care managers or subject to medical necessity preauthorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following procedures will apply to health care referrals and preauthorizations in catchment areas under TRICARE Prime:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The first priority for referral for specialty care or inpatient care will be to the local MTF (or to any other MTF in which catchment area the enrollee resides).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the local MTF(s) are unavailable for the services needed, but there is another MTF at which the needed services can be provided, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services at that MTF.

The enrollment fee required by Sec. 199.18(c) may be paid in monthly or quarterly installments. Monthly fees may be payable by an allotment from retired or retainer pay, or paid from a financial institution through an electronic transfer of funds. For beneficiaries paying enrollment fees on an installment basis, failure to make a required installment payment on a timely basis [including a grace period, as determined by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)] will result in termination of the beneficiary's enrollment in Prime and disqualification from future enrollment in Prime for a period of one year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Voluntary disenrollment. Any non-active duty beneficiary may disenroll at any time. Disenrollment will take effect in accordance with administrative procedures established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Retired beneficiaries and their family members who disenroll prior to their annual enrollment renewal date will not be eligible to reenroll in Prime for a -1-year period from the effective date of the disenrollment. Active Duty family members may change their enrollment status twice in an enrollment year. Any additional disenrollment changes will result in an enrollment lock out for a 1-year period from the effective date of the disenrollment. Enrollment rules may be waived by the

Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) based on extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Period revision. Periodically, certain features, rules or procedures of Prime, Extra and/or Standard may be revised. If such revisions will have a significant effect on participants' costs or access to care, beneficiaries will be given the opportunity to change their enrollment status coincident with the revisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effects of failure to enroll. Beneficiaries offered the opportunity to enroll in Prime, who do not enroll, will remain in Standard and will be eligible to participate in Extra on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special procedures for certain dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 to E-4. As an exception to other procedures in paragraph (o) of this section, dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 to E-4, if such dependents reside in a catchment area of a military hospital, are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime. The applicable military hospital shall provide written notice of the automatic enrollment to the member and the affected dependents. The effective date of such automatic enrollment shall be the date of the written notice, unless an earlier effective date is requested by the member or affected dependents, so long as the affected dependents were as of the effective date dependents of an active duty member in pay grades E-1 to E-4 and residents in a catchment area of a military hospital. Dependents who are automatically enrolled under this paragraph may disenroll at any time. Such disenrollment shall remain in effect until such dependents take specific action to reenroll which such dependents may do at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Civilian preferred provider networks. A major feature of the TRICARE program is the civilian preferred provider network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Status of network providers. Providers in the preferred provider network are not employees or agents of the Department of Defense or the United States Government. Rather, they are independent contractors of the government (or other independent entities having business arrangements with the government). Although network providers must follow numerous rules and procedures of the TRICARE program, on matters of professional judgment and professional practice, the network provider is independent and not operating under the direction and control of the Department of Defense. Each preferred provider must have adequate professional liability insurance, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and must agree to indemnify the United States Government for any liability that may be assessed against the United States Government that is attributable to any action or omission of the provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Utilization management policies. Preferred providers are required to follow the utilization management policies and procedures of the TRICARE program. These policies and procedures are part of discretionary judgments by the Department of Defense regarding the methods of delivering and financing health care services that will best achieve health and economic policy objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Quality assurance requirements. A number of quality assurance requirements and procedures are applicable to preferred network providers. These are for the purpose of assuring that the health care services paid for with government funds meet the standards called for in the contract or provider agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provider qualifications. All preferred providers must meet the following qualifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> They must be CHAMPUS authorized providers and CHAMPUS participating providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All physicians in the preferred provider network must have staff privileges in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). This requirement may be waived in any case in which a physician's practice does not include the need for admitting privileges in such a hospital, or in locations where no JCAHO accredited facility exists. However, in any case in which the requirement is waived, the physician must comply with alternative qualification standards as are established by the MTF Commander (or other authorized official).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All preferred providers must agree to follow all quality assurance, utilization management, and patient referral procedures established pursuant to this section, to make available to designated DoD utilization management or quality monitoring contractors medical records and other pertinent records, and to authorize the release of information to MTF Commanders regarding such quality assurance and utilization management activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All preferred network providers must be Medicare participating providers, unless this requirement is waived based on extraordinary circumstances. This requirement that a provider be a Medicare participating provider does not apply to providers not eligible to be participating providers under Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The provider must be available to Extra participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The provider must agree to accept the same payment rates negotiated for Prime enrollees for any person whose care is reimbursable by the Department of Defense, including, for example, Extra participants, supplemental care cases, and beneficiaries from outside the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> All preferred providers must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to comply with all other rules and procedures established for the preferred provider network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Access standards. Preferred provider networks will have attributes of size, composition, mix of providers and geographical distribution so that the networks, coupled with the MTF capabilities, can adequately address the health care needs of the enrollees. Before offering enrollment in Prime to a beneficiary group, the MTF Commander (or other authorized person) will assure that the capabilities of the MTF plus preferred provider network will meet the following access standards with respect to the needs of the expected number of enrollees from the beneficiary group being offered enrollment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under normal circumstances, enrollee travel time may not exceed 30 minutes from home to primary care delivery site unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The wait time for an appointment for a well-patient visit or a specialty care referral shall not exceed four weeks; for a routine visit, the wait time for an appointment shall not exceed one week; and for an urgent care visit the wait time for an appointment shall generally not exceed 24 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Emergency services shall be available and accessible to handle emergencies (and urgent care visits if not available from other primary care providers pursuant to paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section), within the service area 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The network shall include a sufficient number and mix of board certified specialists to meet reasonably the anticipated needs of enrollees. Travel time for specialty care shall not exceed one hour under normal circumstances, unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area. This requirement does not apply under the Specialized Treatment Services Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Office waiting times in nonemergency circumstances shall not exceed 30 minutes, except when emergency care is being provided to patients, and the normal schedule is disrupted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special reimbursement methods for network providers. The Director, OCHAMPUS, may establish, for preferred provider networks, reimbursement rates and methods different from those established pursuant to Sec. 199.14. Such provisions may be expressed in terms of percentage discounts off CHAMPUS allowable amounts, or in other terms. In circumstances in which payments are based on hospital-specific rates (or other rates specific to particular institutional providers), special reimbursement methods may permit payments based on discounts off national or regional prevailing payment levels, even if higher than particular institution-specific payment rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Methods for establishing preferred provider networks. There are several

methods under which the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may establish a preferred provider network. These include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There may be an acquisition under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, either conducted locally for that catchment area, in a larger area in concert with other MTF Commanders, regionally as part of a CHAMPUS acquisition, or on some other basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent allowed by law, there may be a modification by the Director, OCHAMPUS, of an existing CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary contract to add TRICARE program functions to the existing responsibilities of the fiscal intermediary contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may follow the ``any qualified provider'' method set forth in paragraph (q) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any other method authorized by law may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Preferred provider network establishment under any qualified provider method. The any qualified provider method may be used to establish a civilian preferred provider network. Under this method, any CHAMPUS-authorized provider within the geographical area involved that meets the qualification standards established by the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may become a part of the preferred provider network. Such standards must be publicly announced and uniformly applied. Also under this method, any provider who meets all applicable qualification standards may not be excluded from the preferred provider network. Qualifications include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provider must meet all applicable requirements in paragraph (p)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provider must agree to follow all quality assurance and utilization management procedures established pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The provider must be a Participating Provider under CHAMPUS for all claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provider must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to all other rules and procedures, that are established, publicly announced, and uniformly applied by the commander (or other authorized official).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The provider must sign a preferred provider network agreement covering all applicable requirements. Such agreements will be for a duration of one year, are renewable, and may be canceled by the provider or the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) upon appropriate notice to the other party. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall establish an agreement model or other guidelines to promote uniformity in the agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> General fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements under TRICARE program. All fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see especially applicable provisions of Sec. 199.9) are applicable to the TRICARE program. Some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program in areas in which the TRICARE program has not been implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Partial implementation. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may authorize the partial implementation of the TRICARE program. The following are examples of partial implementation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The TRICARE Extra Plan and the TRICARE Standard Plan may be offered without the TRICARE Prime Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In remote sites, where complete implementation of TRICARE is impracticable, TRICARE Prime may be offered to a limited group of beneficiaries. In such cases, normal requirements of TRICARE Prime which the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) determines are impracticable may be waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The TRICARE program may be limited to particular services, such as mental health services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Inclusion of Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in TRICARE networks. TRICARE preferred provider networks may include Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities pursuant to arrangements, made with the approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), between those centers and the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designated TRICARE contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Care provided outside the United States to dependents of active duty members. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may, in conjunction with implementation of the TRICARE program, authorize a special CHAMPUS program for dependents of active duty members who accompany the members in their assignments in foreign countries. Under this special program, a preferred provider network will be established through contracts or agreements with selected health care providers. Under the network, CHAMPUS covered services will be provided to the covered dependents with all CHAMPUS requirements for deductibles and copayments waived. The use of this authority by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) for any particular geographical area will be announced in the Federal Register. The announcement will include a description of the preferred provider network program and other pertinent information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska. In view of the unique geographical and environmental characteristics impacting the delivery of health care in the state of Alaska, administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska will not include financial underwriting of the delivery of health care by a TRICARE contractor. All other provisions of this section shall apply to administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska as they apply to the other 49 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Administrative procedures. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, and MTF Commanders (or other authorized officials) are authorized to establish administrative requirements and procedures, consistent with this section, this part, and other applicable DoD Directives or Instructions, for the implementation and operation of the TRICARE program.
