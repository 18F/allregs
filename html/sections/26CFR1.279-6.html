Under section 279(g), in any case in which the  issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, the application  of section 279 shall be determined by treating all of the members of the  affiliated group in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except  that the ratio of debt to equity of, projected earnings of, and the  annual interest to be paid or incurred by any corporation (other than  the issuing corporation determined without regard to this paragraph)  shall be included in the determinations required under section 279(b)(4)  as of any day only if such corporation is a member of the affiliated  group on such day, and, in determining projected earnings of such  corporation under section 279(c)(3), there shall be taken into account  only the earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during  which it was a member of the affiliated group. The total amount of an  affiliated member's assets, indebtedness, projected earnings, and  interest to be paid or incurred will enter into the computation required  by this section, irrespective of   any minority ownership in such member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aggregate money and other assets. In determining the aggregate  money and all the other assets of the affiliated group, the money and  all the other assets of each member of such group shall be separately  computed and such separately computed amounts shall be added together,  except that adjustments shall be made, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There shall be eliminated from the total assets of the  affiliated group any amount which represents stock ownership in any  member of such group;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this  section, the basis of any asset involved in such transaction shall be  the transferor's basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The basis of property in a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13  applies is the basis of the property determined under that section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> There shall be eliminated from the money and all the other  assets of the affiliated group any other amount which, if included,  would result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate money and all  the other assets of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em>:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of intercompany accounts payable,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of intercompany bonds or other evidences of  indebtedness, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of any other indebtedness which, if included, would  result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate indebtedness of such  affiliated group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of Sec. 1.279-5, and then  adding together such separately determined amounts, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>  distributed by one member to another member shall be eliminated, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining the earnings and profits of any member of an  affiliated group, there shall be eliminated any amount of interest  income received or accrued, and of interest expense paid or incurred,  which is attributable to intercompany indebtedness,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No gain or loss shall be recognized in any transaction between  members of the affiliated group, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Members of an affiliated group who file a consolidated return  shall not apply the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-18 dealing with inventory  adjustments in determining earnings and profits for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of Sec. 1.279-5, and  such separately calculated amounts shall be added together, except that  any amount of annual interest to be paid or incurred on any intercompany  indebtedness shall be eliminated from such aggregate interest.
