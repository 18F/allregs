The plan must  include the following elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designation of officials with authority to review and  approve payment of recruitment incentives (subject to paragraph (b) of  this section), including the circumstances under which an official has  the authority to approve payment without higher-level approval under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the designation of officials with  authority to waive the repayment of a recruitment incentive under Sec.  575.111(h);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The categories of employees who are prohibited from receiving  recruitment incentives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required documentation for determining that a position is likely  to be difficult to fill;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any requirements for determining the amount of a recruitment  incentive;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The payment methods that may be authorized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Requirements governing service agreements, which, at a minimum,  must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The criteria for determining the length of a service period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The conditions for terminating a service agreement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The obligations of the agency and the employee, as applicable,  if an agency terminates a service agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow  reconstruction of the action and to fulfill the requirements of  Sec. Sec. 575.112 and 575.113.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an  authorized agency official who is at least one level higher than the  employee's supervisor must review and approve each determination to pay  a recruitment incentive to a newly appointed employee, unless there is  no official at a higher level in the agency. The authorized agency  official must review and approve the recruitment incentive determination  before the agency may pay the incentive to the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When necessary to make a timely offer of employment, an  authorized agency official may establish criteria in advance for  offering recruitment incentives to newly-appointed employees and may  authorize an official who is not lower than a candidate's supervisor to  use these criteria to offer a recruitment incentive (in any amount  within a pre-established range) to a candidate without further review or  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless the head of the agency determines otherwise, an agency  recruitment incentive plan must apply uniformly across the agency.
