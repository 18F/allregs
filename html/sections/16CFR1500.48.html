                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Objective. The sharp point test prescribed by paragraph (d) of  this section will be used by the Commission in making a preliminary  determination that points on toys and other articles intended for use by  children under 8 years of age, and such points exposed in normal use or  as a result of reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse of such toys and  articles, present a potential risk of injury by puncture or laceration  under section 2(s) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C.  1261(s)). The Commission will further evaluate points that are  identified as presenting a potential risk of puncture or laceration  injury to determine the need for individual product regulatory action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The sharp point test of paragraph (d) of  this section is applicable to toys or other articles that are introduced  into interstate commerce on or after December 22, 1978. The sharp point  test shall be applied to any accessible portion of the test sample  before and after subjecting the test sample to the use and abuse tests  of Sec. Sec. 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test- paragraph (c) of each section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exemptions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Toys and other children's articles that are the  subject of any of the following regulations are exempt from this Sec.  1500.48: The regulations for bicycles, non-full-size baby cribs, and  full-size baby cribs (parts 1508, 1509, and 1512, of this chapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Toys that by reason of their functional purpose necessarily  present the hazard of sharp points and that do not have any  nonfunctional sharp points are exempt from this Sec. 1500.48: Provided,  Each toy is identified by a conspicuous, legible, and visible label at  the time of any sale, as having functional sharp   points. An example of such toys is a toy sewing machine with a needle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Articles, besides toys, intended for use by children that by  reason of their functional purpose necessarily present the hazard of  sharp points and that do not have any nonfunctional sharp points are  exempt from this Sec. 1500.48. An example of such articles is a ball- point pen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accessibility--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Any point that is accessible either  before or after these tests of Sec. Sec. 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53  (excluding the bite test--paragraph (c) of each section) are performed  shall be subject to the sharp point test of paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accessible points. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An accessible point for a toy or article  intended for children 3 years of age or less is one that can be  contacted by any portion forward of the collar of the accessibility  probe designated as probe A in figure 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An accessible point for a toy or article intended for children  over 3 years up to 8 years of age is one that can be contacted by any  portion forward of the collar of the accessibility probe designated as  probe B in figure 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An accessible point for a toy or article intended for children  of ages spanning both age groups is one that can be contacted by any  portion forward of the collar of either probe A or B, as shown in figure  2 of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insertion depth for accessibility. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For any hole, recess, or  opening having a minor dimension (The minor dimension of an opening is  the diameter of the largest sphere that will pass through the opening.)  smaller than the collar diameter of the appropriate probe, the total  insertion depth for accessibility shall be up to the collar on the  appropriate probe. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to  simulate knuckle movement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension  larger than the collar diameter of probe A but less than 7.36 inches  (186.9 millimeters), when probe A is used, or a minor dimension larger  than the collar diameter of probe B but less than 9.00 inches (228.6  millimeters), when probe B is used, the total insertion depth for  accessibility shall be determined by inserting the appropriate probe  with the extension shown in figure 2 in any direction up to two and one- quarter times the minor dimension of the probe, recess, or opening,  measured from any point in the plane of the opening. Each probe joint  may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension of  7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters) or larger when probe A is used, or a  minor di-mension of 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters), or larger when  probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility is  unrestricted unless other holes, recesses, or openings within the  original hole, recess, or opening are encountered with dimensions  specified in paragraph (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section. In such  instances, the appropriate paragraphs (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section  shall be followed. If both probes are to be used, a minor dimen-sion  that is 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters or larger shall determine  unrestricted access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inaccessible points. Points shall be considered inaccessible  without testing with a probe if they lie adjacent to a surface of the  test sample and any gap between the point and the adjacent surface does  not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter) either before or after the tests  of Sec. Sec. 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test-- paragraph (c) of each section) are performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sharp point test method--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Principle of operation. The  principle of operation of the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of  this section is as follows (Detailed engineering drawings for a  suggested sharp point tester are available from the Commission's Office  of the Secretary.): A rectangular opening measuring 0.040 inch (1.02  millimeters) wide by 0.045 inch (1.15 millimeters) long in the end of  the slotted cap establishes two reference dimensions. Depth of  penetration of the point being tested determines sharpness. If the point  being tested can contact a sensing head that is recessed a distance of  0.015 inch (0.38 millimeter) below the end cap and can move the sensing  head a further 0.005 inch (0.12 millimeter) against a 0.5-pound (2.2- newton) force of a return spring, the point shall be identified as   sharp. A sharp point tester of the general configuration shown in figure  1 of this section or one yielding equivalent results shall identify a  sharp point. In conducting tests to determine the presence of sharp  points, the Commission will use the sharp point tester shown in figure 1  of this section and the accessibility probes designated as A or B in  figure 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sample to be tested shall be held in such a  manner that it does not move during the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Part of the test sample may need to be removed to allow the  sharp point testing device to test a point that is accessible by the  criteria of paragraph (c) of this section. Such dismantling of the test  sample could affect the rigidity of the point in question. The sharp  point test shall be performed with the point supported so that its  stiffness approximates but is not greater than the point stiffness in  the assembled sample.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Using the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this  section, the adjustment and operation of the sharp point tester is as  follows: Hold the sharp point tester and loosen the lock ring by  rotating it so that it moves towards the indicator lamp assembly a  sufficient distance to expose the calibration reference marks on the  barrel. Rotate the gaging can clockwise until the indicator lamp lights.  Rotate the cap counterclockwise until an equivalent of five divisions  (the distance between the short lines on the cap) have passed the  calibration reference mark. Lock the gaging cap in this position by  rotating the lock ring until it fits firmly against the cap. Insert the  point into the gaging slot in all directions in which it was accessible  by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, and apply a force of  1.00 pound (4.45 newtons). A glowing light identifies the point as  sharp.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The test instruments used by the Commission in its tests for  compliance with this regulation shall have gaging slot opening  dimensions no greater than 0.040 inch by 0.045 inch and shall have the  sensing head recessed a depth of no less than 0.015 inch. The force  applied by the Commission when inserting a point into the gaging slot  shall be no more than 1.00 pound.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For the purpose of conformance with the technical requirements  prescribed by this Sec. 1500.48, the English figures shall be used. The  metric approximations are provided in parentheses for convenience and  information only.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.056</p>
