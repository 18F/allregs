                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each request received shall be acted upon promptly by the PA  Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten (10) days  (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the date of receipt. If  a response cannot be made within ten (10) days due to unusual  circumstances, the PA Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that  period providing information on the status of the request and asking for  such further information as may be necessary to process the request.  Every effort will be made to provide the requested records within thirty  (30) days. ``Unusual circumstances'' shall include circumstances where a  search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage,  field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a  voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on  other individuals must be separated   or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations  with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination  of the request are necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant of access:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to  him or her except where the record is subject to an exemption under the  Act and these rules.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The PA Officer shall notify the individual of such  determination and provide the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The place at which the records may be inspected;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the  period of time that the records will remain available for inspection. In  no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty (30) days from the  date of notification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed  and the estimate of fees pursuant to Sec. 1101.11. In no event shall be  estimated date be later than thirty (30) days from the date of  notification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be  accompanied by another individual during the personal access, subject to  the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific  record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of access: The following methods of access to records by  an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given  situation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection in person may be made in the office specified by the  PA Officer, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through  Friday (excluding holidays);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to  the individual may be arranged, but only if the PA Officer determines  that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can  be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the  records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of  the section or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and  manpower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject  to payment of the fees prescribed in Sec. 1101.11. The Section, at its  own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no  fee will be charged to the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to medical records: Upon advice by a physician that  release of medical information directly to the requester could have an  adverse effect on the requester, the Section may attempt to arrange an  acceptable alternative. This will normally involve release of such  information to a physician named by the requester, with the requester's  written consent. (Note that release to any third party, including a  physician or family member, must comply with the provisions of Sec.  1101.8 of this part.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Section shall supply such other information and assistance  at the time of access to make the record intelligible to the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Section reserves the right to limit access to copies and  abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This  election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an  automated data media such as tape of disc, when the record contains  information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is  permissible under exemptions (for example 5, U.S.C. 552(k)(1)). In no  event shall original records of the Section be made available to the  individual except under the immediate supervision of the PA Officer or  his designee. Title 18 U.S.C. 2701(a) makes it a crime to conceal,  mutilate, obliterate, or destroy a record filed in a public office, or  to attempt to do any of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to  that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her  choice. ``Accompanied'' includes discussion of the record in the  presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record  pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual in writing  and shall include the name of the other individual, a specific  description of the record to which access is   sought, and the date and the signature of the individual to whom the  record pertains. The other individual shall sign the authorization in  the presence of the PA Officer or his designee. An individual shall not  be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision  to be accompanied by another individual during the personal access to a  record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Initial denial of access:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grounds. Access by an individual to a record which pertains to  that individual will be denied only upon a determination by the PA  Officer that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The record is subject to an exemption under the Act and these  rules;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation  of a civil action or proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of Sec. 1101.7(c) pertaining to medical  records have been temporarily invoked; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the  procedural requirements of these rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification. The PA Officer shall give notice of denial of  access of records to the individual in writing and shall include the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PA Officer's name and title or position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of denial;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reasons for the denial, including citation to the  appropriate section of the Act and these rules;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The individual's opportunities for further administrative  consideration, including the identity and address of the responsible  official;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If stated to be administratively final within the Section, the  individual's right to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) (1) and  (5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Administrative review: When an initial denial of a request is  issued by the PA Officer, the individual's opportunities for further  consideration shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, the sole  procedure is a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule  under 5 U.S.C. 553(e). Such petition shall be filed with the  Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water  Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. If the  exception was determined by another agency, the PA Officer will provide  the individual with the name and address of the other agency and any  relief sought by the individual shall be that provided by the  regulations of the other agency. Within the Section, no such denial is  administratively final until such a petition has been filed by the  individual and disposed of on the merits by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, (iii) or (iv) of  this section, the individual may file for review with the Commissioner,  as indicated in the PA Officer's initital denial notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the PA  Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to  the records within the grant and the records within the denial.</p>
