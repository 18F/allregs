                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certified or licensed appraiser means a person who is certified  or licensed by the State agency in the State in which the property that  secures the transaction is located, and who performs the appraisal in  conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice  and the requirements applicable to appraisers in title XI of the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as  amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing regulations, in  effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit risk means the financial risk that a consumer will  default on a loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manufactured home has the same meaning as in 24 CFR 3280.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturer's invoice means a document issued by a manufacturer  and provided with a manufactured home to a retail dealer that separately  details the wholesale (base) prices at the factory for specific models  or series of manufactured homes and itemized options (large appliances,  built-in items and equipment), plus actual itemized charges for freight  from the factory to the dealer's lot or the homesite (including any  rental of wheels and axles) and for any sales taxes to be paid by the  dealer.

A creditor obtains a written appraisal that meets  the requirements for an appraisal required under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section if the creditor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Orders that the appraiser perform the appraisal in conformity  with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and title  XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act  of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing  regulations in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's  certification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Verifies through the National Registry that the appraiser who  signed the appraiser's certification was a certified or licensed  appraiser in the State in which the appraised property is located as of  the date the appraiser signed the appraiser's certification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Confirms that the elements set forth in appendix A to this  subpart are addressed in the written appraisal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Has no actual knowledge contrary to the facts or certifications  contained in the written appraisal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional appraisal for certain higher-priced mortgage loans-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d)(7) of this  section, a creditor shall not extend a higher-priced mortgage loan to a  consumer to finance the acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling  without obtaining, prior to consummation, two written appraisals, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The seller acquired the property 90 or fewer days prior to the  date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property and the price  in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property exceeds the seller's  acquisition price by more than 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The seller acquired the property 91 to 180 days prior to the  date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property and the price  in the consumer's agreement to acquire the property exceeds the seller's  acquisition price by more than 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Different certified or licensed appraisers. The two appraisals  required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may not be performed by  the same certified or licensed appraiser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Relationship to general appraisal requirements. If two  appraisals must be obtained under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each  appraisal shall meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Required analysis in the additional appraisal. One of the two  required appraisals must include an analysis of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The difference between the price at which the seller acquired  the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to  acquire the property, as specified in the consumer's agreement to  acquire the property from the seller;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in market conditions between the date the seller  acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to  acquire the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any improvements made to the property between the date the  seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to  acquire the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No charge for the additional appraisal. If the creditor must  obtain two appraisals under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the  creditor may charge the consumer for only one of the appraisals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Creditor's determination of prior sale date and price--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Reasonable diligence. A creditor must obtain two written appraisals  under paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless the creditor can  demonstrate by exercising reasonable diligence that the requirement to  obtain two appraisals does not apply. A creditor acts with reasonable  diligence if the creditor bases its determination on information  contained in written source documents, such as the documents listed in  appendix B to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> are present and therefore must  obtain two written appraisals in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1)  through (d)(5) of this section, one of the two appraisals shall include  an analysis of the factors in paragraph (d)(4) of this section only to  the extent that the information necessary for the appraiser to perform  the analysis can be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement. The  additional appraisal required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section  shall not apply to extensions of credit that finance a consumer's  acquisition of property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From a local, State or Federal government agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From a person who acquired title to the property through  foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or  non-judicial procedure as a result of the person's exercise of rights as  the holder of a defaulted mortgage loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From a non-profit entity as part of a local, State, or Federal  government program under which the non-profit entity is permitted to  acquire title to single-family properties for resale from a seller who  acquired title to the property through the process of foreclosure, deed- in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial  procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> From a person who acquired title to the property by inheritance  or pursuant to a court order of dissolution of marriage, civil union, or  domestic partnership, or of partition of joint or marital assets to  which the seller was a party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> From an employer or relocation agency in connection with the  relocation of an employee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> From a servicemember, as defined in 50 U.S.C. App. 511(1), who  received a deployment or permanent change of station order after the  servicemember purchased the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Located in an area designated by the President as a federal  disaster area, if and for as long as the Federal financial institutions  regulatory agencies, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(6), waive the  requirements in title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,  and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and  any implementing regulations in that area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Located in a rural county, as defined in 12 CFR  1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Required disclosure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall disclose the following  statement, in writing, to a consumer who applies for a higher-priced  mortgage loan: ``We may order an appraisal to determine the property's  value and charge you for this appraisal. We will give you a copy of any  appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an  additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost.'' Compliance  with the disclosure requirement in Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(2),  satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing of disclosure. The disclosure required by paragraph  (e)(1) of this section shall be delivered or placed in the mail no later  than the third business   day after the creditor receives the consumer's application for a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to this section. In the case of a loan that  is not a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to this section at the time  of application, but becomes a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to  this section after application, the disclosure shall be delivered or  placed in the mail not later than the third business day after the  creditor determines that the loan is a higher-priced mortgage loan  subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Copy of appraisals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, a creditor shall provide to the consumer  a copy of any written appraisal performed in connection with a higher- priced mortgage loan pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing. A creditor shall provide to the consumer a copy of each  written appraisal pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No later than three business days prior to consummation of the  loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a loan that is not consummated, no later than 30  days after the creditor determines that the loan will not be  consummated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form of copy. Any copy of a written appraisal required by  paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be provided to the applicant in  electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and  other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and  National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No charge for copy of appraisal. A creditor shall not charge the  consumer for a copy of a written appraisal required to be provided to  the consumer pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Relation to other rules. The rules in this section 34.203 were  adopted jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (the Board), the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the  National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Housing Finance  Agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau).

The relevant  regulations are those prescribed under section 1110 of the Financial  Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), as  amended (12 U.S.C. 3339), that relate to an appraiser's development and  reporting of the appraisal in effect at the time the appraiser signs the  appraiser's certification. Paragraph (3) of FIRREA section 1110 (12  U.S.C. 3339(3)), which relates to the review of appraisals, is not  relevant for determining whether an appraiser is a certified or licensed  appraiser under Sec. 34.203(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">34.203(b) Exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Compliance with title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). Section 34.203(b)  provides exemptions solely from the requirements of Sec. 34.203(c)  through (f). Institutions subject to the requirements of FIRREA and its  implementing regulations that make a loan qualifying for an exemption  under Sec. 34.203(b) must still comply with appraisal and evaluation  requirements under FIRREA and its implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">34.203(b)(1)  Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Qualified mortgage criteria. Under Sec. 34.203(b)(1), a loan is  exempt from the appraisal requirements of Sec. 34.203 if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em> and (2) a  qualified mortgage pursuant to the Bureau's rules or, for loans insured,  guaranteed, or administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), or Rural Housing Service (RHS), a  qualified mortgage pursuant to applicable rules prescribed by those  agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the  Bureau's definition of a qualified mortgage applies to those loans); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> alters  the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau,  HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec. 34.203(b)(2), the  threshold amount in effect during a particular one-year period is the  amount stated below for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted  effective January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the  Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)  that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Every year, this comment  will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming one- year period after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in  effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount  will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the  percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the  threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000.  However, if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949  increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased  by $900.</p><p class="depth0">i. From January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the threshold  amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold  amount is $25,500.</p><p class="depth0">2. Qualifying for exemption--in general. A transaction is exempt  under Sec. 34.203(b)(2) if the creditor makes an extension of credit at  consummation that is equal to or below the threshold amount in effect at  the time of consummation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Qualifying for exemption--subsequent changes. A transaction does  not meet the condition for an exemption under Sec. 34.203(b)(2) merely  because it is used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan,  unless the amount of the new extension of credit is equal to or less  than the applicable threshold amount. For example, assume a closed-end  loan that qualified for a Sec. 34.203(b)(2) exemption at consummation in  year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is  greater than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these  circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable  requirements of Sec. 34.203 with respect to the year ten transaction if  the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless  another exemption from the requirements of Sec. 34.203 applies. See  Sec. 34.203(b) and Sec. 34.203(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Secured by a mobile home. For purposes of the exemption in  Sec. 34.203(b)(3), a mobile home does not include a manufactured home,  as defined in Sec. 34.203(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction-to-permanent loans. Section 34.203 does not apply to  a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. This  exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the  construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 34.203  does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction  loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a  different creditor, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt  from the requirements of Sec. 34.203. See Sec. 34.203(b). When a  construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the  general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit pursuant to  Regulation Z (12 CFR 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either  one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the  permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the  two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See 12 CFR  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's  Regulation Z, comment 17(c)(6)-2. Which disclosure option a creditor  elects under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of  whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to  Sec. 34.203. When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate  transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be  compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is  comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under  Sec. 34.203. When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single  transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate  charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in  accordance with 12 CFR 1026.35(a)(1) (incorporated into 12 CFR part 34,  subpart G by Sec. 34.202) and appendix D to 12 CFR part 1026. The annual  percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a  transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine  coverage under Sec. 34.203. If the transaction is determined to be a  higher-priced mortgage loan not otherwise exempt under Sec. 34.203(b),  only the permanent phase is subject to the requirements of Sec. 34.203.</p><p class="depth0">2. Financing initial construction. The exemption for construction  loans in Sec. 34.203(b)(4) applies to temporary financing of the  construction of a dwelling that will be replaced by permanent financing  once construction is complete. The exemption does not apply, for  example, to loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes that  have not been or are in the process of being built when the financing  obtained by the consumer at that time is permanent. See  Sec. 34.203(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(7)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(7)(i)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Same credit risk holder. The requirement that the holder of the  credit risk on the existing obligation and the refinancing be the same  applies to situations in which an entity bears the financial  responsibility for the default of a loan by either holding the loan in  its portfolio or guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to  investors in a mortgage-backed security in which the loan is pooled. See  Sec. 34.203(a)(2) (defining ``credit risk''). For example, a credit risk  holder could be a bank that bears the credit risk on the existing  obligation by holding the loan in the bank's portfolio. Another example  of a credit risk holder would be a government-sponsored enterprise that  bears the risk of default on a loan by guaranteeing the payment of  principal and any interest on a loan to investors in a mortgage-backed  security. The holder of credit risk under Sec. 34.203(b)(7)(i)(A) does  not mean individual investors in a mortgage-backed security or providers  of private mortgage insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same credit risk holder--illustrations.</p><p class="depth0">Illustrations of the credit risk holder of the existing obligation  continuing to be the credit risk holder of the refinancing include, but  are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a bank, thus  the bank holds the credit risk. The bank arranges to refinance the loan  and also will hold the refinancing in its portfolio. If the refinancing  otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under  Sec. 34.203(b)(7), the transaction will qualify for the exemption  because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation  and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply  regardless of whether the bank arranged to refinance the loan directly  or indirectly, such as through the servicer or subservicer on the  existing obligation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a  government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), thus the GSE holds the credit  risk. The existing obligation is then refinanced by the servicer of the  loan and immediately transferred to the GSE. The GSE pools the  refinancing in a mortgage-backed security guaranteed by the GSE, thus  the GSE holds the credit risk on the refinance loan. If the refinance  transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under  Sec. 34.203(b)(7), the transaction will qualify for the exemption  because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation  and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply  regardless of whether the existing obligation was refinanced by the  servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation (acting as a  ``creditor'' under 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17)) or by a different creditor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that  will be sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an agreement that has  been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated.  Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward commitment.'' A  refinance loan does not satisfy the requirement of  Sec. 34.203(b)(7)(i)(A) if the loan will be acquired pursuant to a  forward commitment, such that the credit risk on the refinance loan will  transfer to a person who did not hold the credit risk on the existing  obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(7)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. Under Sec. 34.203(b)(7)(ii), the  regular periodic payments on the refinance loan must not: Result in an  increase of the principal balance (negative amortization); allow the  consumer to defer repayment of principal (see 12 CFR 1026.43, and the  Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment  43(e)(2)(i)-2); or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the  legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal  and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the  loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any  interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step- rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an  explanation of the term ``substantially equal,'' see 12 CFR 1026.43, the  Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment  43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a  refinancing meeting the requirements of Sec. 34.203(b)(7) because it  does not require ``regular periodic payments.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(7)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible use of proceeds. The exemption for a refinancing  under Sec. 34.203(b)(7) is available only if the proceeds from the  refinancing are used exclusively for the existing obligation and amounts  attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. The existing  obligation includes the unpaid principal balance of the existing first  lien loan, any earned unpaid finance charges, and any other lawful  charges related to the existing loan. For guidance on the meaning of  refinancing   costs, see 12 CFR 1026.23, the Official Staff Interpretations to the  Bureau's Regulations Z, comment 23(f)-4. If the proceeds of a  refinancing are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens  or to provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary  spending, the transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a  refinancing under Sec. 34.203(b)(7) from the appraisal requirements in  Sec. 34.203.</p><p class="depth0">For applications received on or after July 18, 2015</p><p class="depth0">34.203(c)(1) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Safe harbor. A creditor that satisfies the safe harbor conditions  in Sec. 34.203(c)(2)(i) through (iv) complies with the appraisal  requirements of Sec. 34.203(c)(1). A creditor that does not satisfy the  safe harbor conditions in Sec. 34.203(c)(2)(i) through (iv) does not  necessarily violate the appraisal requirements of Sec. 34.203(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2.

Appraisal from a previous transaction. An appraisal that was  previously obtained in connection with the seller's acquisition or the  financing of the seller's acquisition of the property does not satisfy  the requirements to obtain two written appraisals under  Sec. 34.203(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. 90-day, 180-day calculation. The time periods described in  Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii) are calculated by counting the day after  the date on which the seller acquired the property, up to and including  the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property that  secures the transaction. For example, assume that the creditor  determines that date of the consumer's acquisition agreement is October  15, 2012, and that the seller acquired the property on April 17, 2012.  The first day to be counted in the 180-day calculation would be April  18, 2012, and the last day would be October 15, 2012. In this case, the  number of days from April 17 would be 181, so an additional appraisal is  not required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date seller acquired the property. For purposes of  Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), the date on which the seller acquired the  property is the date on which the seller became the legal owner of the  property pursuant to applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. For the  date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property under  Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), the creditor should use the date on which  the consumer and the seller signed the agreement provided to the  creditor by the consumer. The date on which the consumer and the seller  signed the agreement might not be the date on which the consumer became  contractually obligated under State law to acquire the property. For  purposes of Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), a creditor is not obligated  to determine whether and to what extent the agreement is legally binding  on both parties. If the dates on which the consumer and the seller  signed the agreement differ, the creditor should use the later of the  two dates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Price at which the seller acquired the property. The price at  which the seller acquired the property refers to the amount paid by the  seller to acquire the property. The price at which the seller acquired  the property does not include the cost of financing the property.</p><p class="depth0">6. Price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property.  The price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property is  the price indicated on the consumer's agreement with the seller to  acquire the property. The price the consumer is obligated to pay to  acquire the property from the seller does not include the cost of  financing the property. For purposes of Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), a  creditor is not obligated to determine whether and to what extent the  agreement is legally binding on both parties.

The requirements that a creditor obtain  two separate appraisals under Sec. 34.203(d)(1), and that each appraisal  be conducted by a different licensed or certified appraiser under  Sec. 34.203(d)(2), indicate that the two appraisals must be conducted  independently of each other. If the two certified or licensed appraisers  are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same appraisal firm,  then whether they have conducted the appraisal independently of each  other must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the  particular case known to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">34.203(d)(3) Relationship to general appraisal requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1.

If a written source document describes the  seller's acquisition price in a manner that indicates that the price  described is an estimated or assumed amount and not the actual price,  the creditor should look at an alternative document to satisfy the  reasonable diligence standard in determining the price at which the  seller acquired the property.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable diligence--oral statements insufficient. Reliance on  oral statements of interested parties, such as the consumer, seller, or  mortgage broker, does not constitute reasonable diligence under  Sec. 34.203(d)(6)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Lack of information and conflicting information--two appraisals  required. If a creditor is unable to demonstrate that the requirement to  obtain two appraisals under Sec. 34.203(d)(1) does not apply, the  creditor must obtain two written appraisals before extending a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to the requirements of Sec. 34.203 See also  comment 34.203(d)(6)(ii)-1. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor orders and reviews the results of a title  search, which shows that a prior sale occurred between 91 and 180 days  ago, but not the price paid in that sale. Thus, based on the title  search, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the price  the consumer is obligated to pay under the consumer's acquisition  agreement is more than 20 percent higher than the seller's acquisition  price, pursuant to Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(ii). Before extending a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of  Sec. 34.203, the creditor must either: perform additional diligence to  ascertain the seller's acquisition price and, based on this information,  determine whether two written appraisals are required; or obtain two  written appraisals in compliance with Sec. 34.203(d)(6). See also  comment 34.203(d)(6)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor reviews the results of a title search  indicating that the last recorded purchase was more than 180 days before  the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. Assume also that the  creditor subsequently receives a written appraisal indicating that the  seller acquired the property between 91 and 180 days before the  consumer's agreement to acquire the property. In this case, unless one  of these sources is clearly wrong on its face, the creditor would not be  able to determine whether the seller acquired the property within 180  days of the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property  from the seller, pursuant to Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(ii). Before extending a  higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of  Sec. 34.203, the creditor must either: perform additional diligence to  ascertain the seller's acquisition date and, based on this information,  determine whether two written appraisals are required; or obtain two  written appraisals in compliance with Sec. 34.203(d)(6).

Required analysis. In general, the additional appraisal required  under Sec. 34.203(d)(1) should include an analysis of the factors listed  in Sec. 34.203(d)(4)(i) through (iii). However, if, following reasonable  diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in  Sec. 34.203(d)(1)(i) or (ii) are present due to a lack of information or  conflicting information, the required additional appraisal must include  the analyses required under Sec. 34.203(d)(4)(i) through (iii) only to  the extent that the information necessary to perform the analyses is  known. For example, assume that a creditor is able, following reasonable  diligence, to determine that the date on which the seller acquired the  property occurred between 91 and 180 days prior to the date of the  consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is  unable, following reasonable diligence, to determine the price at which  the seller acquired the property. In this case, the creditor is required  to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes an analysis  under Sec. 34.203(d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of the changes in market  conditions and any improvements made to the property between the date  the   seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to  acquire the property. However, the creditor is not required to obtain an  additional written appraisal that includes analysis under  Sec. 34.203(d)(4)(i) of the difference between the price at which the  seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is  obligated to pay to acquire the property.</p><p class="depth0">34.203(d)(7) Exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(d)(7)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Thus, for example, a  creditor of a loan secured by a new manufactured home and land could  comply with Sec. 34.203(c)(1) by obtaining an appraisal conducted by a  state-certified or -licensed appraiser based on plans and specifications  for the new manufactured home and an inspection of the land on which the  property will be sited, as well as any other information necessary for  the appraiser to complete the appraisal assignment in conformity with  the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and the  requirements of FIRREA and any implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(8)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1.

Adjustments. The requirement that the cost estimate be from an  independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from  providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to account for  factors such as special features, condition or location. However, the  requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost  service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be  based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost  service used, with associated values that are determined by the  independent cost service.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34.203(b)(8)(ii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1.

Interest in the transaction. A person has a direct or indirect  interest in the transaction if, for example, the person or an affiliate  of that person also serves as a loan officer of the creditor or  otherwise arranges the credit transaction, or is the retail dealer of  the manufactured home. A person also has a prohibited interest in the  transaction if the person is compensated or otherwise receives financial  or other benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">3.
