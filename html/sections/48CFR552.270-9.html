The purpose of this clause is to promote the ease with which the Government may inspect the building. Nothing in this clause shall act to relieve the Lessor of any duty to inspect or liability which might arise as a result of Lessor's failure to inspect for or correct a hazardous condition.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
