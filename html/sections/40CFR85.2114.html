                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior to certifying, the aftermarket part manufacturer must  determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the part to be certified is an emission related part as  defined in Sec. 85.2102. The MOD Director shall deny certification to  any parts which he or she determines is not an emission related part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vehicle or engine configurations for which this part is  being certified. These are the vehicle and engine designs for which the  aftermarket part manufacturer intends to sell the certified aftermarket  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the part qualifies under one of the part categories,  listed in Sec. 85.2122 of this subpart that are eligible to certify  using emission critical parameters and, if so, whether the manufacturer  elects to demonstrate certification using emission critical parameters.  An aftermarket part may be certified under this category only if the  part's emission-critical parameters, as set forth in Sec. 85.2122, are  equivalent to those of the original equipment or previously certified  part it is to replace. Compliance with the emission-critical parameters  discussed in paragraph (b) of this section may be demonstrated by  compliance with the relevant test procedures and criteria specified in  appendix I to this subpart. The requirements of this paragraph apply to  all on-road vehicles and engines. Alternatively, the manufacturer may  elect to demonstrate certification compliance according to the emission  test procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For parts eligible to certify using emission-critical  parameters, certification compliance can be demonstrated as follows. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  The durability procedure contained in appendix I to this subpart can be  used. As an alternative, the aftermarket part manufacturer may use a  different durability procedure if it can demonstrate to the MOD Director  that the alternative procedure results in an improved technical  evaluation of the part's influence on vehicle or engine emissions for  its useful life mileage interval, or results in a significant cost  savings to the aftermarket part manufacturer with no loss in technical  validity compared to the recommended durability procedure. The  aftermarket part manufacturer shall receive the written approval from  the MOD Director prior to implementation of the alternative procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with certification requirements is based on  conformance with all emission-critical parameters in Sec. 85.2122. This  shall be accomplished by performing such procedures, tests, or analyses  described in appendix I, or other procedures subject to the MOD  Director's approval, necessary to ascertain with a high degree of  certainty the emission-critical parameter specifications and tolerances  for the aftermarket part and the original equipment or previously  certified part for which an equivalent aftermarket certified part is to  be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If information is available in appendix I of this subpart to  identify the applicable emission-critical parameters, the aftermarket  part certifier must use such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If sampling and analysis of original equipment or previously  certified parts is relied upon, the aftermarket part certifier must use  sound statistical sampling techniques to ascertain the mean and range of  the applicable emission parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an aftermarket part replaces more than one part on the same  application, it may be certified only if the aftermarket part meets the  applicable emission-critical parameters of Sec. 85.2122 for each part or  parts which the aftermarket part is to replace. If an aftermarket part  is to replace more than one part or an entire system, compliance must be  demonstrated for all emission-critical parameters involved, except those  which relate solely to the interface between the parts being replaced by  the aftermarket part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For parts certifying on the basis of emission test results,  durability demonstration testing shall be conducted as follows. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Prior to certification emission testing, the actual aftermarket part  used for certification testing must meet the durability demonstration  requirements of this paragraph for at least the part's useful life  mileage interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an original equipment part has no scheduled replacement  interval, then the useful life mileage interval of the aftermarket part  of that type or   which replaces the function of that part may be certified with a service  interval less than the useful life of the motor vehicle or motor vehicle  engine, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If any provision of 40 CFR part 86 establishes a minimum  replacement or service interval for an original equipment part during  vehicle or engine certification, then the useful life mileage interval  of the aftermarket part of that type or which replaces the function of  that part is said minimum interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The part manufacturer must decide whether it can demonstrate to  the MOD Director that, during normal vehicle operation, the candidate  part will not accelerate deterioration of any original equipment  emission related parts. This demonstration must be based on technical  rationale that shows that the candidate part has no significant physical  or operational effect on any original emission components or system  which would be different than that experienced by the vehicle operating  with all original equipment emission system parts. The part's effect on  each major emission system must be addressed separately in the  demonstration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the aftermarket part to be certified accelerates  deterioration of any existing emission related parts then certification  shall be carried out as specified under the paragraph (c)(3) of this  section for parts that accelerate deterioration of existing emission  related parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the aftermarket part manufacturer can demonstrate that the  part to be certified will not accelerate deterioration of any existing  emission related components, then the manufacturer can certify according  to paragraph (c)(4) in this section for parts demonstrated to not  accelerate deterioration of existing emission related parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For aftermarket parts that accelerate deterioration of existing  emission related parts during normal operation. (i) The aftermarket test  part can be installed on the durability test vehicle and aged for 50,000  miles using the vehicle durability driving schedules contained in part  86, appendix IV. As an alternative, the aftermarket part manufacturer  may use a different durability procedure if it can demonstrate to the  MOD Director that the alternative procedure results in an improved  technical evaluation of the part's influence on vehicle or engine  emissions for the part's useful life mileage interval, or results in a  significant cost savings to the aftermarket part manufacturer with no  loss in technical validity compared to the recommended durability  schedules in part 86, appendix IV. The aftermarket part manufacturer  shall receive the written approval from the MOD Director prior to  implementation of the alternative procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Note: At the time of certification emission testing, the same part  and vehicle combination used for mileage accumulation shall be used for  emission testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the comparable original equipment part has a recommended  replacement interval of less than 50,000 miles, the test part shall be  replaced no sooner than its useful life mileage interval during the  required 50,000 mile durability demonstration.</p><p class="depth0">Note: At the time of certification emission testing, one of the  aftermarket parts that accumulated at least its useful life mileage  during the aging process under this paragraph shall be installed on the  durability test vehicle that has accumulated 50,000 miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For aftermarket parts demonstrated not to accelerate  deterioration on existing emission related parts during normal  operation, the part manufacturer must determine whether the part will  cause a noticeable change in vehicle driveability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Parts that cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveability,  performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, the durability  driving schedules contained in part 86, appendix IV can be used. As an  alternative, the aftermarket part manufacturer may use a different  durability procedure if it can demonstrate to the MOD Director that the  alternative procedure results in an improved technical evaluation of the  part's influence on vehicle or engine emissions for its useful life  mileage interval, or results in a significant cost savings to the  aftermarket part manufacturer with no loss in technical validity  compared to   the durability schedules in part 86, appendix IV. The aftermarket part  manufacturer shall receive the written approval from the MOD Director  prior to implementation of the alternative procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Parts demonstrated to cause a noticeable change in vehicle  driveability, performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, are  exempt from aging if the part manufacturer can demonstrate to the MOD  Director that the primary failure mode of the aftermarket component or  system affects the driveability, performance, and/or fuel economy of the  vehicle at a level readily detectable by the driver and likely to result  in near term repair of failing components and correction of the  emissions failure. (Use of on-board diagnostics and malfunction  indicators as covered in paragraph (g) of this section is not  necessarily an adequate demonstration that the certified part will be  replaced. The part manufacturer must demonstrate that the diagnostic and  malfunction indicator system will routinely result in repair or  replacement of the part in use).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For parts which only affect evaporative emissions performance,  the aftermarket part manufacturer shall determine and demonstrate to the  MOD Director the appropriate durability procedure to age its part. The  demonstration shall include all documentation, analyses, and test  results that support this determination, and the documentation that  support the durability procedure results shall be submitted with the  notification of intent to certify as per Sec. 85.2115 and is subject to  MOD Director's review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Durability demonstration vehicle selection. The demonstration  vehicle used must represent the ``worst case'' of all the configurations  for which the aftermarket part is being certified. The worst case  configuration shall be that configuration which will likely cause the  most deterioration in the performance characteristics of the aftermarket  part which influence emissions during the part's useful life mileage.  The worst case configuration shall be selected from among those  configurations for which the aftermarket part is to be certified. One of  the following two methods shall be used to select the worst case  durability demonstration vehicle(s):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the first method, the selection shall be based on a technical  judgment by the aftermarket part manufacturer of the impact of the  particular design, or calibration of a particular parameter or  combination of parameters, and/or an analysis of appropriate data, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the second alternative method, the selection shall be made  from among those vehicle configurations with the heaviest equivalent  test weight, and within that group, the largest displacement engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For parts certifying on the basis of emission test results,  certification compliance shall be demonstrated as follows. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  emission test to be used is the Federal Test Procedure as set forth in  the applicable portions of 40 CFR part 86. Certification emission  testing must be carried out using representative production aftermarket  parts as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The test results  must demonstrate that the proper installation of the certified  aftermarket part will not cause the vehicle to fail to meet any  applicable Federal emission requirements under section 202 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following portions of the Federal Test Procedure are not  required to be performed when certifying a part using emission testing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The evaporative emissions portion, if the aftermarket  manufacturer has an adequate technical basis for believing that the part  has no effect on the vehicle's evaporative emissions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The exhaust emissions portion, if the part manufacturer has an  adequate technical basis for believing that the part has no affect on  the vehicle's exhaust emissions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other portions therein which the part manufacturer believes  are not relevant; Provided, That the part manufacturer has requested and  been granted a waiver in writing by the MOD Director for excluding such  portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exhaust Emission Testing. Certification exhaust emission testing  for aftermarket parts shall be carried out in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For light duty vehicle parts that accelerate deterioration of  existing emission related parts, at least one   emission test is required. The test(s) shall be performed according to  the Federal Test Procedure on the same test vehicle and aftermarket part  combination that was previously aged as required. The results of all  tests performed shall be averaged for each emission constituent. The  average values shall meet all applicable Federal emission requirements  under section 202 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For aftermarket parts where the comparable original equipment  part has no recommended replacement interval, the same part and vehicle  combination used for the durability demonstration shall be used for  certification exhaust emission testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For aftermarket parts where the comparable original equipment  part has a recommended replacement interval of less than 50,000 miles,  one of the aftermarket parts that accumulated at least the part's useful  life mileage during the durability demonstration must be installed on  the durability demonstration vehicle that has accumulated 50,000 miles  for certification exhaust emission testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For light duty truck parts that accelerate deterioration of  existing emission related parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An emission test shall be performed on emission test vehicles at  4000 miles and at 50,000 miles, with the part installed. Exhaust  emission deterioration factors for the test vehicle shall be calculated  from these two test results. The aftermarket part manufacturer may elect  to perform other emission tests at interim mileages. However, any  interim tests must be spaced at equal mileage intervals. If more than  one test is performed at any one mileage point, then all tests at this  point shall be averaged prior to determining the deterioration factor.  The deterioration factor shall be calculated using the least squares  straight line method, in accordance with Sec. 86.088-28(a). The  deterioration factor for each emission constituent shall be used to  linearly project the 50,000 mile test result out to 120,000 miles. The  projected 120,000 mile test result shall meet light duty truck emission  standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As an option, the light-duty truck part manufacturer may  durability age the test vehicle and aftermarket part to 120,000 miles,  and then perform one Federal Test Procedure test. The actual test  results in this case must pass all Federal emission standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For parts demonstrated to not accelerate deterioration of  existing emission related parts during normal operation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If parts cause no noticeable change in vehicle driveability,  performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, the certification  exhaust emission test vehicle need not be the same vehicle as that used  for durability demonstration. Upon completion of aging, one Federal Test  Procedure test shall be performed with the aged aftermarket part  installed on a test vehicle that has just completed one Federal Test  Procedure test in the original equipment configuration (i.e., before the  aftermarket part or system is installed). If more than one test is  performed either before or after the aftermarket part is installed, then  an equivalent number of tests must be performed in both configurations.  The results of all tests performed before the part is installed shall be  averaged and the results of all tests performed after the part is  installed shall be averaged for each emission constituent. The  difference in Federal Test Procedure emission results between the tests  with the aged aftermarket part installed and the test vehicle in the  original equipment configuration shall be less than or equal to the  certification vehicle emission margin of any and all of the  certification test vehicles from the various configurations for which  the aftermarket part is being certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For parts demonstrated to cause a noticeable change in vehicle  driveability, performance, and/or fuel economy when the part fails, no  durability aging of the part is required before certification emission  testing. One Federal Test Procedure test shall be performed on the test  vehicle in its original equipment configuration (i.e., before the  aftermarket part or system is installed) and one test with an  aftermarket part representative of production (as provided in paragraph  (e) of this section) installed on the test vehicle. If more than one  test is performed either before or after the aftermarket   part is installed, then an equivalent number of tests must be performed  in both configurations. The results of all tests performed with the  aftermarket part installed shall be averaged and the results of all  tests performed in the original equipment configuration shall be  averaged for each emission constituent. The difference in Federal Test  Procedure emission results between the tests with the aftermarket part  installed and the test vehicle in the original equipment configuration  shall be less than or equal to the certification vehicle emission margin  of any and all of the certification test vehicles from the various  configurations for which the aftermarket part is being certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Evaporative emission testing. For parts determined by the part  manufacturer (with appropriate technical rationale) to affect only  evaporative emissions performance, at least one evaporative emissions  portion of the Federal Test Procedure test shall be performed on the  vehicle in its original equipment configuration and at least one with  the aftermarket part installed. Both the original equipment and  aftermarket part shall be aged according to paragraph (c)(5) of this  section prior to testing. If more than one test is performed either  before or after the aftermarket part is installed, then an equivalent  number of tests must be performed in both configurations. The emission  results of all tests performed before the part is installed shall be  averaged and the emission results of all tests performed after the part  is installed shall be averaged. The difference in Federal Test Procedure  emission results between the tests with the aged aftermarket part  installed and the test vehicle in the original equipment configuration  shall be less than or equal to the certification vehicle emission margin  of any and all of the certification test vehicles from the various  configurations for which the aftermarket part is being certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emission test vehicle selection: The test vehicle used must  represent the ``worst case'' with respect to emissions of all those  configurations for which the aftermarket part is being certified. The  worst case configuration shall be that configuration which, having the  aftermarket part installed, is least likely to meet the applicable  emission standards among all those configurations on which the  aftermarket part is intended to be installed as a certified aftermarket  part. One of the following two methods shall be used to select the worst  case emission test vehicle(s):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the first method, the selection shall be based on a technical  judgment by the aftermarket part manufacturer of the impact of the  particular design or calibration of a particular parameter or  combination of parameters and/or an analysis of appropriate data, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the second alternative method, two defined worst case test  vehicles shall be selected from the vehicle configurations using the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The first test vehicle is that engine family for which the  largest number of parts are projected to be sold. Within that family the  manufacturer shall select the configurations with the heaviest  equivalent test weight, and then within that group the configuration  with the largest displacement engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The second test vehicle shall be from a different vehicle  manufacturer than the first test vehicle, or if the aftermarket part  applies to only one vehicle manufacturer, from a different engine  family. Engine families are determined by the vehicle manufacturer or  when certifying under 40 CFR part 86. Within that group, the second test  vehicle is selected from the vehicle configurations with the heaviest  equivalent test weight, and then, within that group, the configuration  with the largest displacement engine. If a part applies to only one  engine family then only the vehicle specified in paragraph  (d)(5)(ii)(A), of this section, is required to be tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The results of certification tests using the worst case  vehicle selections made in this section shall only be applicable for  configurations that are required to meet the same or less stringent  (numerically higher) emission standards than those of the worst case  configuration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The worst case test vehicle(s) selected for certification  emission testing is(are) not required to meet Federal emission standards  in its original configuration. However, each test vehicle shall have  representative emissions performance that is close to the standards and  have no obvious emission defects. Each test vehicle shall be tuned  properly and set to the vehicle manufacturer's specifications before  testing is performed. Any excessively worn or malfunctioning emission  related part shall be repaired prior to testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test part selection. Certification shall be based upon tests  utilizing representative production aftermarket parts selected in a  random manner in accordance with accepted statistical procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Replacing original equipment parts. Installation of any  certified aftermarket part shall not result in the removal or rendering  inoperative of any original equipment emission related part other than  the part(s) being replaced. Furthermore, installation of any certified  aftermarket part shall not require the readjustment of any other  emission related part to other than the vehicle manufacturer  specifications, cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to the  public health, welfare or safety, or result in any additional range of  parameter adjustability or accessibility to adjustment than that of the  vehicle manufacturer's emission related parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Affects on vehicle on board diagnostic system. Installation of  any certified aftermarket part shall not alter or render inoperative any  feature of the on-board diagnostic system incorporated by the vehicle  manufacturer. The certified part may integrate with the existing  diagnostic system if it does not alter or render inoperative any  features of the system. However, use of on-board diagnostics or warning  indicators to alert the driver to part failure is not sufficient by  itself to qualify the part for exemption from aging under paragraph  (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The part manufacturer must demonstrate that  the diagnostic and malfunction indicator system will routinely result in  repair or replacement of the aftermarket part in use.
