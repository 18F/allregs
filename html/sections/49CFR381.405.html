                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally, pilot programs are initiated by the FMCSA when the  agency determines that there may be an effective alternative to one or  more of the requirements in the FMCSRs, but does not have sufficient  research data to   support the development of a notice of proposed rulemaking to change the  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may request the FMCSA to initiate a pilot program. However,  the decision of whether to propose a pilot program will be made at the  discretion of the FMCSA. The FMCSA is not required to publish a notice  in the Federal Register requesting public comment on your ideas or  suggestions for pilot programs.</p>
