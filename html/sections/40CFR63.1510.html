                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Summary. On and after the compliance date established by Sec. 63.1501, the owner or operator of a new or existing affected source or emission unit must monitor all control equipment and processes according to the requirements in this section. Monitoring requirements for each type of affected source and emission unit are summarized in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&M;) plan. The owner or operator must prepare and implement for each new or existing affected source and emission unit, a written operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&M;) plan. The owner or operator of an existing affected source must submit the OM&M; plan to the responsible permitting authority no later than the compliance date established by Sec. 63.1501(a). The owner or operator of any new affected source must submit the OM&M; plan to the responsible permitting authority within 90 days after a successful initial performance test under Sec. 63.1511(b), or within 90 days after the compliance date established by Sec. 63.1501(b) if no initial performance test is required. The plan must be accompanied by a written certification by the owner or operator that the OM&M; plan satisfies all requirements of this section and is otherwise consistent with the requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator must comply with all of the provisions of the OM&M; plan as submitted to the permitting authority, unless and until the plan is revised in accordance with the following procedures. If the permitting authority determines at any time after receipt of the OM&M; plan that any revisions of the plan are necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section or this subpart, the owner or operator

must promptly make all necessary revisions and resubmit the revised plan. If the owner or operator determines that any other revisions of the OM&M; plan are necessary, such revisions will not become effective until the owner or operator submits a description of the changes and a revised plan incorporating them to the permitting authority. Each plan must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Process and control device parameters to be monitored to determine compliance, along with established operating levels or ranges, as applicable, for each process and control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A monitoring schedule for each affected source and emission unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for the proper operation and maintenance of each process unit and add-on control device used to meet the applicable emission limits or standards in Sec. 63.1505.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedures for the proper operation and maintenance of monitoring devices or systems used to determine compliance, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calibration and certification of accuracy of each monitoring device, at least once every 6 months, according to the manufacturer's instructions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for the quality control and quality assurance of continuous emission or opacity monitoring systems as required by the general provisions in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedures for monitoring process and control device parameters, including procedures for annual inspections of afterburners, and if applicable, the procedure to be used for determining charge/feed (or throughput) weight if a measurement device is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Corrective actions to be taken when process or operating parameters or add-on control device parameters deviate from the value or range established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Procedures to determine and record the cause of any deviation or excursion, and the time the deviation or excursion began and ended; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for recording the corrective action taken, the time corrective action was initiated, and the time/date corrective action was completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A maintenance schedule for each process and control device that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations for routine and long-term maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Documentation of the work practice and pollution prevention measures used to achieve compliance with the applicable emission limits and a site-specific monitoring plan as required in paragraph (o) of this section for each group 1 furnace not equipped with an add-on air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Labeling.

(1) An owner or operator of a secondary aluminum processing unit at a facility must include, within the OM&M; plan prepared in accordance with Sec. 63.1510(b), the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator of a secondary aluminum processing unit at a facility must include, within the OM&M; plan prepared in accordance with Sec. 63.1510(b), the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The identification of each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The specific control technology or pollution prevention measure to be used for each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit and the date of its installation or application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The emission limit calculated for each secondary aluminum processing unit and performance test results with supporting calculations demonstrating initial compliance with each applicable emission limit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Information and data demonstrating compliance for each emission unit with all applicable design, equipment, work practice or operational standards of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The monitoring requirements applicable to each emission unit in a secondary aluminum processing unit and the monitoring procedures for daily calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average using the procedure in Sec. 63.1510(t).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The SAPU compliance procedures within the OM&M; plan may not contain any of the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any averaging among emissions of differing pollutants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The inclusion of any affected sources other than emission units in a secondary aluminum processing unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The inclusion of any emission unit while it is shutdown; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The inclusion of any periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction in emission calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To revise the SAPU compliance provisions within the OM&M; plan prior to the end of the permit term, the

owner or operator must submit a request to the applicable permitting authority containing the information required by paragraph (s)(1) of this section and obtain approval of the applicable permitting authority prior to implementing any revisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Secondary aluminum processing unit. Except as provided in paragraph (u) of this section, the owner or operator must calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F for each secondary aluminum processing unit on a daily basis. To calculate the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average, the owner or operator must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate and record the total weight of material charged to each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit for each 24-hour day of operation using the feed/charge weight information required in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator chooses to comply on the basis of weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, rather than weight of material charged to the emission unit, all performance test emissions results and all calculations must be conducted on the aluminum production weight basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiply the total feed/charge weight to the emission unit, or the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, for each emission unit for the 24-hour period by the emission rate (in lb/ton of feed/charge) for that emission unit (as determined during the performance test) to provide emissions for each emission unit for the 24-hour period, in pounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Divide the total emissions for each SAPU for the 24-hour period by the total material charged to the SAPU, or the weight of aluminum produced by the SAPU over the 24-hour period to provide the daily emission rate for the SAPU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Compute the 24-hour daily emission rate using Equation 4:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR00.003</p><p class="depth0">Where,
Eday = The daily PM, HCl, or D/F emission rate for the</p><p class="depth0">secondary aluminum processing unit for the 24-hour period;Ti = The total amount of feed, or aluminum produced, for</p><p class="depth0">emission unit i for the 24-hour period (tons or Mg);ERi = The measured emission rate for emission unit i as</p><p class="depth0">determined in the performance test (lb/ton or [micro]g/Mg of</p><p class="depth0">feed/charge); andn = The number of emission units in the secondary aluminum processing</p><p class="depth0">unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant each day by summing the daily emission rates for each pollutant over the 3 most recent consecutive days and dividing by 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Secondary aluminum processing unit compliance by individual emission unit demonstration. As an alternative to the procedures of paragraph (t) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate, through performance tests, that each individual emission unit within the secondary aluminum production unit is in compliance with the applicable emission limits for the emission unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Alternative monitoring method for lime addition. The owner or operator of a lime-coated fabric filter that employs intermittent or noncontinuous lime addition may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative method for monitoring the lime addition schedule and rate based on monitoring the weight of lime added per ton of feed/charge for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test. An alternative monitoring method will not be approved unless the owner or operator provides assurance through data and information that the affected source will meet the relevant emission standards on a continuous basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Alternative monitoring methods. If an owner or operator wishes to use an alternative monitoring method to demonstrate compliance with any emission standard in this subpart, other than those alternative monitoring methods which may be authorized pursuant to Sec. 63.1510(j)(5) and Sec. 63.1510(v), the owner or operator may submit an application to the Administrator. Any such application will be processed according to the criteria and procedures set forth in paragraphs (w)(1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than those specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until necessary data are submitted and approval is received to use another monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring methods no later than the notification of the performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (w)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data or information justifying the request, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the required approach;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirements, including the operating parameters to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, and how the limit is to be calculated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Data and information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement(s) would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s). Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the responsibility to comply with any provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
