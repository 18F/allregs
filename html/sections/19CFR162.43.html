Seized  property shall be appraised as required by section 606, Tariff Act of  1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1606). The term ``domestic value'' as used  therein shall mean the price at which such or similar property is freely  offered for sale at the time and place of appraisement, in the same  quantity or quantities as seized, and in the ordinary course of trade.  If there is no market for the seized property at the place of  appraisement, such value in the principal market nearest to the place of  appraisement shall be reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Property not under seizure. The basis for a claim for forfeiture  value or for an assessment of a penalty relating to the forfeiture value  of property not under seizure is the domestic value as defined in  paragraph (a) of this section, except that the value shall be fixed as  of the date of the violation. In the case of entered merchandise, the  date of the violation shall be the date of the entry, or the date of the  filing of the document, or the commission of the act forming the basis  of the claim, whichever is later.
