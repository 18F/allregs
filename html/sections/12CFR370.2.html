Good cause exists if the Board finds that the economic conditions and circumstances that led to the establishment of the transaction account guarantee program are likely to continue beyond December 31, 2010 and that extending the transaction account guarantee program for an additional period of time will help mitigate or resolve those conditions and circumstances. If the Board decides to extend the transaction account guarantee program beyond December 31, 2010 for an additional period of time, it will do so without further rulemaking; however, the FDIC will publish notice of any extension no later than October 29, 2010. Participating entities must update the disclosures required by Sec. 370.5(h)(5), as necessary, to reflect the current TAG expiration date, including any extension of such date.
