The  conveyance may be made with or without consideration, and subject to  terms and conditions deemed necessary to protect the interests of the  United States. Excepted from this authority is the conveyance of any  interest in real property that can be transferred under title 23 of the  United States Code (see Sec. 644.421), and to public lands in the  National Forest System.</p>
