An electric arc furnace consists of the furnace shell, roof, and the transformer.</p><p class="depth0">Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking facility means a steel plant that produces carbon, alloy, or specialty steels using an EAF. This definition excludes EAF steelmaking facilities at steel foundries and EAF facilities used to produce nonferrous metals.</p><p class="depth0">Free organic liquids means material that fails the paint filter test by EPA Method 9095B, (revision 2, dated November 1994) (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) after accounting for water using a moisture determination test by ASTM Method D2216-05 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14). If, after conducting a moisture determination test, if any portion of the material passes through and drops from the filter within the 5-minute test period, the material contains free organic liquids.</p><p class="depth0">Leaded steel means steel that must meet a minimum specification for lead content (typically 0.25 percent or more) and for which lead is a necessary alloy for that grade of steel.</p><p class="depth0">Mercury switch means each mercury-containing capsule or switch assembly that is part of a convenience light switch mechanism installed in a vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Motor vehicle means an automotive vehicle not operated on rails and usually operated with rubber tires for use on highways.</p><p class="depth0">Motor vehicle scrap means vehicle or automobile bodies, including automobile body hulks, that have been processed through a shredder. Motor vehicle scrap does not include automobile manufacturing bundles, or miscellaneous vehicle parts, such as wheels, bumpers or other components that do not contain mercury switches.</p><p class="depth0">Nonferrous metals means any pure metal other than iron or any metal alloy for which an element other than iron is its major constituent by percent in weight.</p><p class="depth0">Scrap provider means the person (including a broker) who contracts directly with a steel mill to provide scrap that contains motor vehicle scrap. Scrap processors such as shredder operators or vehicle dismantlers that do not sell scrap directly to a steel mill are not scrap providers.</p><p class="depth0">Specialty steel means low carbon and high alloy steel other than stainless steel that is processed in an argon-oxygen decarburization vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Stainless steel means low carbon steel that contains at least 10.5 percent chromium.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Table 1 to Subpart YYYYY of Part 63--Applicability of General</p><p class="depth0">Provisions to Subpart YYYYY</p><p class="depth0">As required in Sec. 63.10691(a), you must comply with the requirements of the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A) shown in the following table.
