No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur. The longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the stall. In addition, it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For level wing stalls, the roll occurring between the stall and the completion of the recovery may not exceed approximately 20 degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For turning flight stalls, the action of the airplane after the stall may not be so violent or extreme as to make it difficult, with normal piloting skill, to effect a prompt recovery and to regain control of the airplane. The maximum bank angle that occurs during the recovery may not exceed--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approximately 60 degrees in the original direction of the turn, or 30 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates up to 1 knot per second; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approximately 90 degrees in the original direction of the turn, or 60 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates in excess of 1 knot per second.
