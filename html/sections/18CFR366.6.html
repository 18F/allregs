Unless otherwise provided by Commission rule or order,  a person may continue to engage in activities or transactions authorized  under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 prior to the  effective date of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005,  February 8, 2006, until the later of the date such authorization expires  or December 31, 2007, so long as that person continues to comply with  the terms of such authorization. If any such activities or transactions  are challenged in a formal Commission proceeding, the person claiming  prior authorization shall be required to provide at that time the full  text of any such authorization (whether by rule, order, or letter) and  the application(s) or pleading(s) underlying such authorization (whether  by rule, order, or letter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financing Authorizations. Holding companies that intend to rely  on financing authorization orders or letters issued by the Securities  and Exchange Commission must file these orders or letters with the  Commission within 30 days after the effective date of the Public Utility  Holding Company Act of 2005, February 8, 2006; any reports or other  submissions that, pursuant to such financing authorizations, previously  were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission must instead be  filed with the Commission, effective February 8, 2006. For the purposes  of this section, compliance with the terms of such financing  authorizations includes the requirement to notify the Commission of any  financing transactions that a holding company engages in pursuant to  such financing authorization.</p>
