Sec. 718.102(b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tolerance rules apply to those fields for which a staking and  referencing was performed but such acreage was not planted according to  those measurements or when a measurement service is not requested for  acreage destroyed to meet program requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tolerance rules do not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Program requirements of Sec.
