                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following articles, services, and related technical data are designated as defense articles and defense services pursuant to sections 38 and 47(7) of the Arms Export Control Act. Changes in designations will be published in the Federal Register. Information and clarifications on whether specific items are defense articles and services under this subchapter may appear periodically through the Internet Web site of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Order of review. In order to classify your article on the U.S. Munitions List, you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of your item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on the U.S. Munitions List. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match the particular characteristics and functions of your article to a specific entry within the appropriate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Order of review. In order to classify your article on the U.S. Munitions List, you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of your item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on the U.S. Munitions List. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match the particular characteristics and functions of your article to a specific entry within the appropriate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Composition of an entry. Within each U.S. Munitions List category, defense articles are described by an alpha paragraph designation. These designations may include subparagraph(s) to further define the described defense article. Each U.S. Munitions List category starts with end-platform designations followed by major systems and equipment, and parts, components, accessories, and attachments. Most U.S. Munitions List categories contain an entry on technical data (see Sec. 120.10 of this subchapter) and defense services (see Sec. 120.9 of this subchapter) related to the defense articles described in that U.S. Munitions List category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Significant military equipment. An asterisk may precede an entry in a U.S. Munitions List category. The asterisk means the enumerated defense article is deemed to be ``Significant Military Equipment'' to the extent specified in Sec. 120.7 of this subchapter. Note that technical data directly related to the manufacture or production of any defense articles enumerated in any category designated as Significant Military Equipment (SME) is also designated as SME.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Annex. Inclusion in Sec. 121.16 of this subchapter, or annotation with the parenthetical ``(MT)'' at the end of a U.S. Munitions List paragraph, indicates those defense articles and defense services that are on the MTCR Annex. See Sec. 120.29 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Specially designed. When applying the definition of specially designed (see Sec. 120.41 of this subchapter), follow the sequential analysis set forth as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> if your commodity or software is controlled for reasons other than having a specially designed control parameter on the U.S. Munitions List, no further review of the definition of specially designed is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> if your commodity or software is not enumerated on the U.S. Munitions List, it may be controlled because of a specially designed control parameter. If so, begin any analysis with Sec. 120.41(a) and proceed through each subsequent paragraph. If a commodity or software would not be controlled as a result of the application of the standards in Sec. 120.41(a), then it is not necessary to work through Sec. 120.41(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> if a commodity or software is controlled as a result of Sec. 120.41(a), then it is necessary to continue the analysis and to work through each of the elements of Sec. 120.41(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> commodities or software described in any Sec. 120.41(b) subparagraph are not

specially designed commodities or software controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, but may be subject to the jurisdiction of another U.S. Government regulatory agency (see Sec. 120.5 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Classified.
