Unless approval  authority is otherwise delegated by the Secretary of Defense, all DSCA  requests shall be submitted to the office of the Executive Secretary of  the Department of Defense. For assistance provided according to  Sec. 185.4(g) of this part, civil authorities shall be informed that  oral requests for assistance in an emergency must be followed by a  written request that includes an offer to reimburse the Department of  Defense at the earliest available opportunity. States also must  reimburse the United States Treasury in accordance with section 9701 of  title 31, U.S.C. Support may be provided on a non-reimbursable basis  only if required by law or if both authorized by law and approved by the  appropriate DoD official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All requests from civil authorities and qualifying entities for  assistance shall be evaluated for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legality (compliance with laws).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lethality (potential use of lethal force by or against DoD  Forces).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Risk (safety of DoD Forces).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost (including the source of funding and the effect on the DoD  budget).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appropriateness (whether providing the requested support is in  the interest of the Department).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Readiness (impact on the Department of Defense's ability to  perform its primary mission).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> DSCA plans shall be compatible with the National Response  Framework; the National Incident Management System; all contingency  plans for operations in the locations listed in Sec. 185.1(c) of this  part; and any other national plans (approved by the President or  Secretary of Defense) or DoD issuances governing DSCA operations. DSCA  planning will consider command and control options that will emphasize  unity of effort, and authorize direct liaison if authorized by the  Secretary of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Federal military commanders, Heads of DoD Components, and/or  responsible DoD civilian officials (hereafter referred to collectively  as ``DoD officials'') have immediate response authority as described in  this part. In response to a request for assistance from a civil  authority, under imminently serious conditions and if time does not  permit approval from higher authority, DoD officials may provide an  immediate response by temporarily employing the resources under their  control, subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher  headquarters, to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great  property damage within the United States. Immediate response authority  does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use of  military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or  compulsory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DoD official directing a response under immediate response  authority shall immediately notify the National Joint Operations and  Intelligence Center (NJOIC), through the chain of command, of the  details of the response. The NJOIC will inform appropriate DoD  Components to including the geographic Combatant Command.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise  to the response is no longer present (e.g., when there are sufficient  resources available from State, local, and other Federal agencies to  respond adequately and that agency or department has initiated response  activities) or when the initiating DoD official or a higher authority  directs an end to the response. The DoD official directing a response  under immediate response authority shall reassess whether there remains  a necessity for the Department of Defense to respond under this  authority as soon as practicable but, if immediate response activities  have not yet ended, not later than 72 hours after the request of  assistance was received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Support provided under immediate response authority should be  provided on a cost-reimbursable basis, where appropriate or legally  required, but will not be delayed or denied based on the inability or  unwillingness of the requester to make a commitment to reimburse the  Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The authority of State officials is recognized to direct a State  immediate response using National Guard personnel under State command  and control (including personnel in a title 32, U.S.C. (hereafter  referred to as ``Title 32'') status) in accordance with State law, but  National Guard personnel will not be placed in or extended in Title 32  status to conduct State immediate response activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Federal military commanders are provided emergency authority  under this part. Federal military forces shall not be used to quell  civil disturbances unless specifically authorized by the President in  accordance with applicable law (e.g., chapter 15 of title 10, U.S.C.) or  permitted under emergency authority, as described below (See DoD  Directive 3025.12 \16\ and DoD Directive 5525.5 \17\.) In these  circumstances, those Federal military commanders have the authority, in  extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior authorization by the  President is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are  unable to control the situation, to engage temporarily in activities  that are necessary to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances  because: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\16\ Available by downloading at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/pdf/302512p.pdf.</p><p class="depth2">\17\ Available by downloading at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/pdf/552505p.pdf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such activities are necessary to prevent significant loss of  life or wanton destruction of property and are necessary to restore  governmental function and public order, or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When duly constituted Federal, State, or local authorities are  unable or decline to provide adequate protection for Federal property or  Federal governmental functions. Federal action, including the use of  Federal military forces, is authorized when necessary to protect the  Federal property or functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Except for immediate response and emergency authority as  described in Sec. 185.4(g) and Sec. 185.4(i) of this part, only the  Secretary of Defense may approve requests from civil authorities or  qualifying entities for Federal military support for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Defense assistance in responding to civil disturbances (requires  Presidential authorization) in accordance with DoD Directive 3025.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Defense response to CBRNE events (see DoD Instruction 2000.18)  \18\. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\18\ Available by downloading at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/pdf/200018p.pdf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Defense assistance to civilian law enforcement organizations,  except as authorized in DoD Directive 5525.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assistance in responding with assets with potential for  lethality. This support includes loans of arms; vessels or aircraft; or  ammunition. It also includes assistance under section 382 of title 10,  U.S.C., and section 831 of title 18, U.S.C.; all support to  counterterrorism operations; and all support to civilian law enforcement  authorities in situations where a confrontation between civilian law  enforcement and civilian individuals or groups is reasonably  anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Federal military forces employed for DSCA activities shall  remain under Federal military command and control at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Special event support to a qualifying entity shall be treated as  DSCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> All requests for DSCA mutual and automatic aid via the DoD Fire  & Emergency Services programs shall be in accordance with DoD  Instruction 6055.06.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> DSCA is a total force mission (see DoD Directive 1200.17).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> No DoD unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) will be used for DSCA  operations, including support to Federal, State, local, and tribal  government organizations, unless expressly approved by the Secretary of  Defense. Use of armed UAS for DSCA operations is not authorized. (See  DoD Directive 5240.01, Executive Orders 12333 and 13388, and DoD 5240.1- R.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Direct liaison between DoD Components and the States should  occur only when time does not permit compliance with Sec. 185.5(m)(1) of  this part. In each such instance, the Chief, National Guard Bureau, will  be informed of the direct liaison.</p>
