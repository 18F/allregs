                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial Processing. (1) When a party has filed a petition for enforcement of a final decision, the alleged noncomplying party must file one of the following within 15 days of the date of service of the petition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a party has filed a petition for enforcement of a final decision, the alleged noncomplying party must file one of the following within 15 days of the date of service of the petition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of compliance, including a narrative explanation of the calculation of back pay and other benefits, and supporting documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section of the compliance actions that the party has completed, and a statement of the actions that are in process and the actions that remain to be taken, along with a reasonable schedule for full compliance; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement showing good cause for the failure to comply completely with the decision of the Board.
The party that filed the petition may respond to that submission within 10 days after the date of service of the submission. The parties must serve copies of their pleadings on each other as required under Sec. 1201.26(b)(2) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency is the alleged noncomplying party, it shall submit the name, title, grade, and address of the agency official charged with complying with the Board's order, and inform such official in writing of the potential sanction for noncompliance as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and (e)(2)(A), even if the agency asserts it has fully complied. The agency must advise the Board of any change to the identity or location of this official during the pendency of any compliance proceeding. In the absence of this information, the Board will presume that the highest ranking appropriate agency official who is not appointed by the President by and with the consent of the Senate is charged with compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The judge may convene a hearing if one is necessary to resolve matters at issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the judge finds that there has been compliance or a good faith effort to take all actions required to be in compliance with the final decision, he or she will state those findings in a decision. That decision will be subject to the procedures for petitions for review by the Board under subpart C of this part, and subject to judicial review under Sec. 1201.120 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the judge finds that the alleged noncomplying party has not taken all actions required to be in full compliance with the final decision, the judge will issue an initial decision resolving all issues raised in the petition for enforcement and identifying the specific

actions the noncomplying party must take to be in compliance with the Board's final decision. A copy of the initial decision will be served on the responsible agency official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If an initial decision described under paragraph (a)(5) of this section is issued, the party found to be in noncompliance must do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the extent that the party decides to take the actions required by the initial decision, the party must submit to the Clerk of the Board, within the time limit for filing a petition for review under Sec. 1201.114(e) of this part, a statement that the party has taken the actions identified in the initial decision, along with evidence establishing that the party has taken those actions. The narrative statement must explain in detail why the evidence of compliance satisfies the requirements set forth in the initial decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that the party decides not to take all of the actions required by the initial decision, the party must file a petition for review under the provisions of Secs. 1201.114 and 1201.115 of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The responses required by the preceding two paragraphs may be filed separately or as a single pleading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the agency is the party found to be in noncompliance, it must advise the Board, as part of any submission under this paragraph, of any change in the identity or location of the official responsible for compliance previously provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The complying party may file evidence and argument in response to any submission described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section by filing opposing evidence and argument with the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of the date such submission is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final Decision of noncompliance. If a party found to be in noncompliance under paragraph (a)(5) of this section does not file a timely pleading with the Clerk of the Board as required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the findings of noncompliance become final and the case will be processed under the enforcement provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consideration by the Board. (1) Following review of the initial decision and the written submissions of the parties, the Board will render a final decision on the issues of compliance. Upon finding that the agency is in noncompliance, the Board may, when appropriate, require the agency and the responsible agency official to appear before the Board to show why sanctions should not be imposed under 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and 1204(e)(2)(A). The Board also may require the agency and the responsible agency official to make this showing in writing, or to make it both personally and in writing. The responsible agency official has the right to respond in writing or to appear at any argument concerning the withholding of that official's pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following review of the initial decision and the written submissions of the parties, the Board will render a final decision on the issues of compliance.

If an appellant files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with a Board order, the agency generally has the burden to prove its compliance with the Board order by a preponderance of the evidence. However, if any party files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement, that party has the burden of proving the other party's breach of the settlement agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification to the Comptroller General. When appropriate, the Board may certify to the Comptroller General of the United States, under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(A), that no payment is to be made to a certain Federal employee. This order may apply to any Federal employee, other than a Presidential appointee subject to confirmation by the Senate, who is found to be in noncompliance with the Board's order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of Special Counsel's action or failure to act. Failure by the Special Counsel to file a complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(1)(C) and subpart D of this part will not preclude the Board from taking action under this subpart.
