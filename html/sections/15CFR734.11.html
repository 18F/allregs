                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If research is funded by the U.S. Government, and specific national security controls are agreed on to protect information resulting from the research, Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part will not apply to any export or reexport of such information in violation of such controls. However, any export or reexport of information resulting from the research that is consistent with the specific controls may nonetheless be made under this provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples of ``specific national security controls'' include requirements for prepublication review by the Government, with right to withhold permission for publication; restrictions on prepublication dissemination of information to non-U.S. citizens or other categories of persons; or restrictions on participation of non-U.S. citizens or other categories of persons in the research. A general reference to one or more export control laws or regulations or a general reminder that the Government retains the right to classify is not a ``specific national security control''.
