The warning shall also summarize the requirements of Sec. 1101.3 and state that the Act contains a criminal penalty for the unauthorized dislosure of records to which it applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During working hours: (i) The area in which the records are maintained or regularly used shall be occupied by authorized personnel or (ii) access to the records shall be restricted by their storage in locked metal file cabinets or a locked room.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During non-working hours, access to the records shall be restricted by their storage in locked metal file cabinets or a locked room.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a locked room is the method of security provided for a system, that security shall be supplemented by: (i) Providing lockable file cabinets or containers for the records or (ii) changing the lock or locks for the room so that they may not be opened with a master key. For purposes of this paragraph, a master key is a key which may be used to open rooms other than the room containing records subject to the Act, unless those rooms are utilized by officials or employees authorized to have access to the records subject to the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Personnel handling personal information during routine use will ensure that the information is properly controlled to prevent unintentional or unauthorized disclosure.
