                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedure for approving/implementing a sector allocation  proposal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any person may submit a sector allocation proposal for a  group of limited access NE multispecies vessels to the Council and  request that the sector be implemented through either a biennial  adjustment or framework adjustment, as specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(2),  as long as it is submitted at least 1 year prior to the date the sector  wants to begin operations in accordance with the conditions and  restrictions of this section. The sector allocation proposal must  contain an appropriate analysis that assesses the impact of the proposed  sector, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. Any  biennial adjustment or framework adjustment developed to implement a  sector allocation proposal must be in compliance with the general  requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Eligibility. Any valid limited access NE multispecies permit,  including a Handgear A permit and those permits held in confirmation of  permit history pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(J) as of May 1, 2008, is  eligible to join a NE multispecies sector, provided the permit complies  with the restrictions specified in this section. Any valid limited  access Category A or B monkfish permit may be eligible to join a NE  multispecies sector, as described in this section, pursuant to any  measures adopted by a future revision to the Monkfish FMP by both the  New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. Vessels that  do not join a sector remain subject to the NE multispecies regulations  for common pool vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Minimum size. To be authorized to operate as a sector under this  section, a sector must be comprised of at least three NE multispecies  permits issued to at least three different persons, none of whom have  any common ownership interests in the permits, vessels, or businesses  associated with the permits issued the other two or more persons in that  sector. Having an ownership interest in a permit includes, but is not  limited to, persons or entities who are shareholders, officers, or  partners in a corporation owning a permit; who are partners (general or  limited) to a permit owner; who, in any way, partly own a permit; or who  derive any financial benefit, or exercises any control over, another  permit. As long as at least three persons issued a NE multispecies  permit meet these requirements, permit owners may have common ownership  interests in other permits, vessels, or businesses associated with such  permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> TAC allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Allocated stocks. Each sector shall be  allocated a TAC in the form of an ACE for each NE multispecies stock,  with the exception of Atlantic halibut, ocean pout, windowpane flounder  (both the GOM/GB and the SNE/MA stocks), and Atlantic wolffish based  upon the cumulative PSCs of vessels/permits participating   in each sector during a particular fishing year, as described in  paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Eastern GB stocks--(1) Allocation. Each sector allocated ACE for  stocks managed under the terms of the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing  Understanding in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as specified in  Sec. 648.85(a), shall be allocated a specific portion of the ACE for  such stocks that can only be harvested from the Eastern U.S./Canada  Area, as specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(1). The ACE specified for the  Eastern U.S./Canada Area portions of these stocks shall be proportional  to the sector's allocation of the overall ACL available to all vessels  issued a limited access NE multispecies permit for these stocks pursuant  to Sec. 648.90(a)(4). For example, if a sector is allocated 10 percent  of the GB cod ACL available to all vessels issued a limited access NE  multispecies permit, that sector would also be allocated and may harvest  10 percent of that ACE from the Eastern U.S./Canada Area. In this  example, if the overall GB cod ACL available to all vessels issued a  limited access NE multispecies permit is 1,000 mt, of which 100 mt is  specified to the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, the sector would be allocated  100 mt of GB cod, of which no more than 10 mt could be harvested from  the Eastern U.S./Canada Area and no more than 90 mt could be harvested  from the rest of the GB cod stock area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iii) of  this section. Re-allocation of haddock ACE may only be made within a  sector, and not between sectors. For example, if 100 mt of a sector's GB  haddock ACE is specified to the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, the sector  could re-allocate up to 100 mt of that ACE to the Western U.S./Canada  Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application to re-allocate ACE. GB haddock ACE specified to the  Eastern U.S./Canada Area may be re-allocated to the Western U.S./Canada  Area through written request to the Regional Administrator. This request  must include the name of the sector, the amount of ACE to be re- allocated, and the fishing year in which the ACE re-allocation applies,  as instructed by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approval of request to re-allocate ACE. NMFS shall approve or  disapprove a request to re-allocate GB haddock ACE provided the sector,  and its participating vessels, is in compliance with the reporting  requirements specified in this part. The Regional Administrator shall  inform the sector in writing, within 2 weeks of the receipt of the  sector's request, whether the request to re-allocate ACE has been  approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, unless otherwise instructed by  NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Carryover. (1) With the exception of GB yellowtail flounder, a  sector may carryover an amount of ACE equal to 10 percent of its  original ACE for each stock that is unused at the end of one fishing  year into the following fishing year, provided that the total unused  sector ACE plus the overall ACL for the following fishing year does not  exceed the ABC for the fishing year in which the carryover may be  harvested. If this total exceeds the ABC, NMFS shall adjust the maximum  amount of unused ACE that a sector may carryover (down from 10 percent)  to an amount equal to the ABC of the following fishing year. Any  adjustments made would be applied to each sector based on its total  unused ACE and proportional to the cumulative PSCs of   vessels/permits participating in the sector for the particular fishing  year, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(C)(1)</em>, but shall not increase  individual sector's allocation of Eastern GB stocks during the following  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This carryover ACE remains effective during the subsequent  fishing year even if vessels that contributed to the sector allocation  during the previous fishing year are no longer participating in the same  sector for the subsequent fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryover accounting. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the overall ACL for a particular  stock is exceeded, the allowed carryover of a particular stock harvested  by a sector, minus the NMFS-specified de minimis amount, shall be  counted against the sector's ACE for purposes of determining an overage  subject to the AM in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> De Minimis Carryover Amount. The de minimis carryover amount is  one percent of the overall sector sub-ACL for the fishing year in which  the carryover would be harvested. NMFS may change this de minimis  carryover amount for any fishing year through notice consistent with the  Administrative Procedure Act. The overall de minimis carryover amount  would be applied to each sector proportional to the cumulative PSCs of  vessels/permits participating in the sector for the particular fishing  year, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Maximum ACE allocation. There is no maximum amount of ACE that  can be allocated to a particular sector during each fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em>  shall remain with the permit indefinitely, but may be permanently  reduced or eliminated due to a permit sanction or other enforcement  action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, joins a new sector, or fishes pursuant to  the provisions of the common pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> shall then be multiplied by a factor of 1/PSC of  remaining permits as of June 1 of each year, unless another date is  specified by the Regional Administrator, to calculate the GB cod PSC for  each permit for the following fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> shall then be  multiplied by a factor of 1/PSC of remaining permits as of July 1 of  each year, unless another date is specified by the Regional  Administrator, to calculate the GB cod PSC for each permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, an ACE overage means catch of regulated species or ocean  pout by vessels participating in a particular sector that exceeds the  ACE allocated to that sector, as of the date received   or purchased by the dealer, whichever occurs first, after considering  all ACE transfer requests ultimately approved by NMFS during the current  fishing year, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, unless  otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CC/GOM Yellowtail Flounder Stock Area. The CC/GOM Yellowtail  Flounder Stock Area, for the purposes of identifying stock areas for  trip limits specified in Sec. 648.86, and for determining areas  applicable to sector allocations of CC/GOM yellowtail flounder ACE  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, is defined as the area  bounded on the north and west by the coastline of the United States, on  the east by the U.S./Canadian maritime boundary, and on the south by  rhumb lines connecting the following points in the order stated:</p><p class="depth0">CC/GOM Yellowtail Flounder Stock Area ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Point                   N.

If declining stock  conditions result in a need to reduce fishing mortality, and all sectors  and common pool vessels have operated within their ACE or sub-ACL  limits, a sector's percentage share shall not be changed, but the amount  this share represents may be reduced due to reduced overall ACL for a  particular stock. If stock conditions improve, and certain sectors stay  within their ACE while other sectors or the common pool exceed their  respective ACEs or sub-ACLs, the sectors that stay within their ACEs  shall receive a temporary increase in ACE equal to the amount that other  sectors or the common pool   exceeded their ACE or sub-ACL, divided among such sectors proportional  to each sector's share of the ACL available to vessels issued a limited  access NE multispecies permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Overage penalty if there is sufficient ACE to cover the overage.  If a sector exceeds an ACE allocated to it during the previous fishing  year, but has sufficient ACE to address the overage pursuant to this  paragraph (b)(1)(iii) based upon the cumulative PSCs of participating  vessels during the fishing year following the overage, no overage  penalty shall be applied to any member permit/vessel that leaves that  sector to fish under the provisions of the common pool or in another  sector in the year following the overage. Any impacts to departing  member permits/vessels may be specified and addressed by the sector  operations plan and associated sector contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Overage penalty if there is insufficient ACE to cover an  overage. If a sector exceeds an ACE allocated to it during the previous  fishing year, but disbands in the year following the overage, or  otherwise does not have sufficient ACE to address the overage pursuant  to this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) based upon the cumulative PSCs of permits/ vessels participating in that sector during the fishing year following  the overage, individual permit holders that participated in the sector  during the fishing year in which the overage occurred shall be  responsible for reducing their DAS/PSC to account for that overage in  the subsequent fishing year, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> PSC reduction. If a sector disbands following an overage, and  the owner of an individual permit joins another sector for the  subsequent fishing year, that permit's contribution toward the ACE for  the stock for which the overage occurred to the other sector in the  subsequent fishing year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the  overage divided by the number of permits/vessels participating in the  sector during the fishing year in which the overage occurred. For  example, if a sector comprised of 10 permits/vessels exceeded its GB cod  ACE by 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) during the previous fishing year, but later  disbands, each permit/vessel that was in that sector, but then joins  another sector during the following fishing year shall have its  contribution of GB cod to another sector temporarily reduced by 1,000 lb  (453.6 kg) during the subsequent fishing year for the purposes of  calculating the available GB cod ACE allocated to another sector during  that fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DAS reduction. If a sector disbands following an overage and the  owner of an individual permit elects to fish under the provisions of the  common pool during the subsequent fishing year, that permit/vessel's NE  multispecies Category A DAS allocation for the subsequent fishing year  shall be temporarily reduced by an amount proportional to the highest  percentage overage by that sector of any of the stocks for which an  overage occurred. For example, if a sector exceeded its GB cod ACE by 10  percent and its pollock ACE by 15 percent, each permit would receive a  15-percent reduction in its Category A DAS allocation for the subsequent  fishing year if fishing under the provisions of the common pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fishing prohibition. If a sector does not disband following an  overage, but otherwise does not have sufficient ACE to cover an overage  based upon the PSC of participating permits, that sector's ACE for the  stock for which the overage occurred shall be temporarily reduced to  zero for the following fishing year, and that sector shall be prohibited  from fishing on a sector trip in the stock area associated with the  stock for which the ACE was exceeded during the following year, unless  and until that sector can acquire sufficient ACE from another sector to  cover the remaining overage from the previous fishing year. For example,  if a sector comprised of 10 permits/vessels was allocated 10 mt of GB  cod ACE, but caught 25 mt during the previous fishing year (i.e., it  exceeded its GB cod ACE by 15 mt), each permit/vessel that participating  in that sector during the following fishing year would have its GB cod  PSC temporarily reduced to zero during the subsequent fishing year, and  that sector would not be able to fish on a sector trip in the GB cod  stock area until it could acquire at least an additional 5 mt of GB cod  ACE   from another sector (i.e., 15 mt overage--10 mt ACE for the following  year = 5 mt overage remaining).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ACE buffer. At the beginning of each fishing year, NMFS shall  withhold 20 percent of a sector's ACE for each stock for a period of up  to 61 days (i.e., through June 30), unless otherwise specified by NMFS,  to allow time to process any ACE transfers submitted at the end of the  fishing year pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section and to  determine whether the ACE allocated to any sector needs to be reduced,  or any overage penalties need to be applied to individual permits/ vessels in the current fishing year to accommodate an ACE overage by  that sector during the previous fishing year, as specified in paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section. NMFS shall not withhold 20 percent of a  sector's ACE at the beginning of a fishing year in which default  specifications are in effect, as specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sector enforcement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sector compliance and joint/several  liability. Unless exempted through a letter of authorization specified  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each vessel operator and/or vessel  owner fishing under an approved sector must comply with all NE  multispecies management measures of this part and other applicable law.  Each vessel and vessel operator and/or vessel owner participating in a  sector must also comply with all applicable requirements and conditions  of the operations plan specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and  the letter of authorization issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each sector, permit/vessel owner,  and vessel operator participating in the sector may be charged jointly  and severally for violations of the following sector operations plan  requirements, which may result in an assessment of civil penalties and  permit sanctions: ACE overages, discarding of legal-sized NE  multispecies, and misreporting of catch, including both landings and  discards. For the purposes of enforcement, a sector is a legal entity  that can be subject to NMFS enforcement action for violations of the  regulations pertaining to sectors, as specified in this paragraph  (b)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Commitment to a sector. A permit/vessel participating in a  sector must remain in the sector for the remainder of the fishing year.  Such permits/vessels cannot fish under both the sector provisions and  the provisions of the common pool during that same fishing year for any  reason, including, but not limited to, expulsion from the sector  pursuant to enforcement actions or other measures specified in an  approved sector operations plan, vessel replacement, or permit/vessel  sale to another owner. For example, if a permit/vessel is sold by a  sector participant during the fishing year, the new owner must comply  with the sector regulations and the conditions of the sector operations  plan, sector contract, or any other binding agreements among  participating sector vessels for the remainder of the fishing year. If a  permit/vessel has been expelled from a sector, the sector must notify  NMFS of such an expulsion immediately. Any permit/vessel, vessel  operator, or vessel owner removed from a sector during a specific  fishing year consistent with sector rules shall not be eligible to fish  in another sector or under the NE multispecies regulations for common  pool vessels specified in this part for the remainder of that fishing  year. For the purposes of this paragraph, ``permit/vessel'' refers to  the fishing and landings history associated with a particular permit/ vessel enrolled in a specific sector at the start of the fishing year  that was used to calculate the PSC for that permit/vessel and contribute  to the ACE for each stock allocated to that specific sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, any  regulated species or ocean pout caught using gear capable of catching NE  multispecies (i.e., gear not listed as exempted gear under this part)  would be deducted from a sector's ACE if such catch contributed to the  specification of PSC, as described in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(E), and would  not apply to another ACL sub-component pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4).  For example, any regulated species or ocean pout landed while fishing  for or catching skates or monkfish pursuant to the regulations for those  fisheries would be deducted from the sector's ACE for each stock because  such regulated species or ocean pout were caught while also operating  under a NE multispecies DAS. However, if a sector vessel is issued a  limited access General Category Atlantic Sea Scallop permit and fishes  for scallops under the provisions specific to that permit, any  yellowtail flounder caught by the vessel on such trips would be deducted  from the other sub-component of the appropriate stock of yellowtail  flounder's ACL specified for the Atlantic Sea Scallop fishery and not  from the yellowtail flounder ACE for the sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Discards. A sector vessel may not discard any legal-sized  regulated species or ocean pout allocated to sectors pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, unless otherwise required pursuant  to Sec. 648.86(l). Discards of undersized regulated species or ocean  pout by a sector vessel must be reported to NMFS consistent with the  reporting requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this  section. Discards shall not be included in the information used to  calculate a vessel's PSC, as described in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(E), but  shall be counted against a sector's ACE for each NE multispecies stock  allocated to a sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> must meet the service provider standards  specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and be approved by NMFS  in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section, but shall be less than 100 percent  of all sector trips. In the event that a NMFS-sponsored observer and a  third-party at-sea monitor are assigned to the same trip, only the NMFS  observer must observe that trip. If either an at-sea monitor or  electronic monitoring is   assigned to a particular trip, a vessel may not leave port without the  appropriate at-sea monitor or electronic monitoring equipment on board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, beginning in fishing year 2013, coverage  levels must be sufficient to at least meet the coefficient of variation  specified in the Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology at the  overall stock level for each stock of regulated species and ocean pout,  and to monitor sector operations, to the extent practicable, in order to  reliably estimate overall catch by sector vessels. In making its  determination, NMFS shall take into account the goals and objective of  groundfish monitoring programs at Sec. 648.11(l), the National Standards  and requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, including but not limited  to the costs to sector vessels and NMFS, and any other relevant factors.  For FYs 2013 and beyond, NMFS shall specify a separate coverage rate,  lower than the coverage rate for all other sector trips, for sector  trips fishing with 10-inch (25.4-cm) mesh or larger gillnets on a  monkfish DAS, pursuant to Sec. 648.91(c)(1)(iii), and only in the SNE  Broad Stock Area, as defined at Sec. 648.10(k)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hail reports. For the purposes of the at-sea monitoring  requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section, sector  vessels must submit all hail reports for a sector trip in which the NE  multispecies catch applies against the ACE allocated to a sector, as  specified in this part, to service providers offering at-sea monitoring  services. The mechanism and timing of the transmission of such hail  reports must be consistent with instructions provided by the Regional  Administrator for any at-sea or electronic monitoring program required  by paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section, or specified in the annual  sector operations plan, consistent with paragraph (b)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notification of service provider change. If, for any reason, a  sector decides to change approved service providers used to provide at- sea or electronic monitoring services required in this paragraph  (b)(1)(v), the sector manager must first inform NMFS in writing in  advance of the effective date of the change in approved service  providers in conjunction with the submission of the next weekly sector  catch report specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vi)(B) of this section. A  sector may employ more than one service provider at any time, provided  any service provider employed by a sector meets the standards specified  in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> VMS declarations and trip-level catch reports. Prior to each  sector trip, a sector vessel must declare into broad stock areas in  which the vessel fishes and submit the VTR serial number associated with  that trip pursuant to Sec. 648.10(k). The sector vessel must also submit  a VMS catch report detailing regulated species and ocean pout catch by  broad stock areas when fishing in multiple stock areas on the same trip,  pursuant to Sec. 648.10(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Weekly catch report. Each sector must submit weekly reports to  NMFS stating the remaining balance of ACE allocated to each sector based  upon regulated species and ocean pout landings and discards of vessels  participating in that sector and any compliance/enforcement concerns.  These reports must include at least the following information, as  instructed by the Regional Administrator: Week ending date; species,  stock area, gear, number of trips, reported landings (landed pounds and  live pounds), discards (live pounds), total catch (live pounds), status  of the sector's ACE (pounds remaining and percent remaining), and  whether this is a new or updated record of sector catch for each NE  multispecies stock allocated to that particular sector; sector  enforcement issues; and a list of vessels landing for that reporting  week. These weekly catch reports must be submitted no later than 0700 hr  on the second Monday after the reporting week, as defined in this part.  The frequency of these reports must be increased to more than a weekly  submission when the balance of remaining ACE is low,   as specified in the sector operations plan and approved by NMFS. If  requested, sectors must provide detailed trip-by-trip catch data to NMFS  for the purposes of auditing sector catch monitoring data based upon  guidance provided by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Year-end report. An approved sector must submit an annual year- end report to NMFS and the Council, no later than 60 days after the end  of the fishing year, that summarizes the fishing activities of  participating permits/vessels, which must include at least the following  information: Catch, including landings and discards, of all species by  sector vessels; the permit number of each sector vessel that fished for  regulated species or ocean pout; the number of vessels that fished for  non-regulated species or ocean pout; the method used to estimate  discards by sector vessels; the landing port used by sector vessels;  enforcement actions; and other relevant information required to evaluate  the biological, economic, and social impacts of sectors and their  fishing operations consistent with confidentiality requirements of  applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Interaction with other fisheries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use of DAS. A sector  vessel must comply with all measures specified for another fishery  pursuant to this part, including any requirement to use a NE  multispecies DAS. If the regulations of another fishery require the use  of a NE multispecies DAS, the DAS allocation and accrual provisions  specified in Sec. 648.82(d) and (e), respectively, apply to each trip by  a sector vessel, as applicable. For example, if a sector vessel is also  issued a limited access monkfish Category C permit and is required to  use a NE multispecies DAS concurrent with a monkfish DAS under this  part, any NE multispecies DAS used by the sector vessel accrues, as  specified in Sec. 648.82(e)(1)(ii) based upon the vessel's NE  multispecies DAS allocation calculated pursuant to  Sec. 648.82(d)(1)(iv)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Availability of ACE. Notwithstanding the requirements in  paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A) of this section, if a sector has not been  allocated or does not acquire sufficient ACE available to cover the  catch of a particular stock of NE multispecies while participating in  another fishery in which such catch would apply to the ACE allocated to  a sector, vessels participating in that sector cannot participate in  those other fisheries unless NMFS has approved a sector operations plan  that ensures that regulated species or ocean pout will not be caught  while participating in these other fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Application to transfer ACE. ACE may be transferred from one  sector to another through written request to the Regional Administrator.  This request must include the name of the sectors involved, the amount  of each ACE to be transferred, the fishing year in which the ACE  transfer applies, and the amount of compensation received for any ACE  transferred, as instructed by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Approval of an ACE transfer request. NMFS shall approve/ disapprove a request to transfer ACE based upon compliance by each  sector and its participating vessels with the reporting requirements  specified in this part. The Regional Administrator shall inform both  sectors in writing whether the ACE transfer request has been approved  within 2 weeks of the receipt of the ACE transfer request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this section,  ACE transferred pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(viii) is only valid  for the fishing year in which the transfer is approved, with the  exception of ACE transfer requests that are submitted up to 2 weeks into  the subsequent fishing year to address any potential ACE overages from  the previous fishing year, as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this  section, unless otherwise instructed by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Trip limits. With the exception of stocks listed in  Sec. 648.86(1) and the Atlantic halibut trip limit at Sec. 648.86(c), a  sector vessel is not limited in the amount of allocated NE multispecies  stocks that can be harvested on a particular fishing trip, unless  otherwise specified in the operations plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, NMFS may decline to propose for  approval such sector operations plans, even if the Council has approved  such sector.

A state-operated permit bank must  meet and is subject to the following requirements and conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The state-operated permit bank must be initially established  using a Federal grant award from NOAA through a valid Memorandum of  Agreement (MOA) with NMFS and the state must maintain and comply with  such MOA. The MOA must contain and the state must comply with at least  the following requirements and conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The state may not associate a state-operated permit bank permit  with a vessel engaged in any fishing or other on-the-water activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The state must establish the minimum eligibility criteria to  determine whether a sector and its associated vessels are qualified to  receive either ACE or DAS from the state-operated permit bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The state must identify a program contact person for the state  agency administering the state-operated permit bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The state must provide to NMFS a list of all permits held by  the state under the aegis of the state-operated permit bank, and declare  which permits will be used in the coming fishing year for exclusively  DAS leasing to   common pool vessels and which permits are to be used exclusively for  transferring ACE to sectors (including the leasing of DAS to sector  vessels for the purpose of complying with the requirements of other  FMPs); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The state must prepare and submit an annual performance report  to NMFS, and that said performance report must include, at a minimum,  the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A comprehensive listing of all permits held by the state- operated permit bank, identifying whether a permit was used for ACE  transfers to sectors (including DAS leases to the sector members) or DAS  leases to common pool vessels, the total amount of ACE, by stock, and  DAS available to the state-operated permit bank for transfers and leases  to sectors and common-pool vessels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A comprehensive listing of all sectors to which ACE was  transferred from the state-operated permit bank, including the amount,  by stock, of ACE transferred to each sector, including a list of all  vessels that harvested the ACE transferred to the sector and the amounts  harvested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A comprehensive listing of all sector vessels to which DAS were  leased from the state-operated permit bank, including the number of DAS  leased to each sector vessel; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A comprehensive listing of all common pool vessels to which DAS  were leased from the state-operated permit bank, including the number of  DAS leased to each common pool vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. If a state is issued a permit that meets sector  eligibility requirements, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, such permit may be held by a state-operated permit bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation and utilization of ACE--(i) Allocation of ACE. The  amount of ACE allocated to a state-operated permit bank shall be derived  from the permits appropriately declared by the state to be ``ACE  permits,'' pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(v) of this section, for the  fishing year and allocated on a stock-by-stock basis pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquiring ACE. Except as provided in this paragraph, a state- operated permit bank may not acquire ACE for a fishing year through a  transfer from a sector. If ACE is transferred to a sector from a state- operated permit bank, NMFS may authorize the return of the unused  portion of such ACE (up to the total originally transferred) to the  state-operated permit bank upon written agreement by both parties. The  state-operated permit bank may then redistribute the available ACE to  another qualifying sector during that fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transferring ACE. Subject to the terms and conditions of the  state-operated permit bank's MOAs with NMFS, as well as ACE transfer  restrictions described in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, a  state-operated permit bank may transfer ACE, on a stock-by-stock basis,  to other state-operated permit banks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Re-allocation of GB haddock ACE. Subject to the terms and  conditions of the state-operated permit bank's MOAs with NMFS, a state- operated permit bank may re-allocate all, or a portion, of its GB  haddock ACE specified for the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to the Western  U.S./Canada Area provided it complies with the requirements in paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation and utilization of days-at-sea--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocation of  DAS. The number of DAS available for a state-operated permit bank to  provide to sector or common pool vessels shall be the accumulated NE  Multispecies Category A DAS assigned to the fishing vessel permits held  by the state and appropriately declared by the state pursuant to  paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section to be either ``ACE permits'' or  ``common pool permits'' for that fishing year, consistent with the terms  of the state's permit bank MOA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquiring DAS. A state-operated permit bank may not acquire DAS  through a lease from a vessel permit (including permits held by other  state-operated permit banks), as described in Sec. 684.82(k). If a  vessel leases DAS from a state-operated permit bank, NMFS may authorize  the return of the unused portion of such DAS to the state-operated  permit bank upon written agreement by both parties, provided none of   the DAS had been used. The state-operated permit bank may then  redistribute the available DAS to another vessel during the same fishing  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Annual report. A state-operated permit bank shall report to the  Council annually on the performance of the state-operated permit bank.  Such reports shall include at a minimum and to the extent that the  information does not conflict with any regulations regarding the  protection of personal and/or proprietary information, all elements  listed in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use of additional funds. If additional funds from any source  become available to a state-operated permit bank, the state-operated  permit bank may not allocate or transfer any ACE that may be associated  with any new permit purchased with those funds, until the state-operated  permit bank provides the Council the opportunity to review the  implications of the expanded state-operated permit bank to the goals and  objectives of the NE Multispecies FMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Violation of the terms and conditions applicable to a state- operated permit bank. If a state or state-operated permit bank violates  or fails to comply with any of the requirements and conditions specified  in this section or in the MOA referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this  section, the state or state-operated permit bank is subject to the  actions and penalties specified in Sec. 648.4(n) or the MOA.
