After appeal to the Director pursuant to Sec. 1081.402, the Director may grant extensions of the time limits for good cause shown. Extensions may be granted on the motion of a party after notice and opportunity to respond is afforded all non-moving parties or on the Director's or the hearing officer's own motion, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Considerations in determining whether to extend time limits or grant postponements, adjournments and extensions. In considering all motions for extensions of time filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Director or the hearing officer should adhere to a policy of strongly disfavoring granting such motions, except in circumstances where the moving party makes a strong showing that the denial of the motion would substantially prejudice its case. In determining whether to grant any motions, the Director or hearing officer, as appropriate, shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of the proceeding to date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The stage of the proceedings at the time of the motion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The impact of the motion on the hearing officer's ability to complete the proceeding in the time specified by Sec. 1081.400(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time limit. Postponements, adjournments, or extensions of time for filing papers shall not exceed 21 days unless the Director or the hearing officer, as appropriate, states on the record or sets forth in a written order the reasons why a longer period of time is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No effect on deadline for recommended decision. The granting of any extension of time pursuant to this section shall not affect any deadlines set pursuant to Sec. 1081.400(a).</p>
