                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pre-decision motions. Unless otherwise permitted by the  Immigration Judge, motions submitted prior to the final order of an  Immigration Judge shall be in writing and shall state, with  particularity the grounds therefore, the relief sought, and the  jurisdiction. The Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for  the making of motions and replies thereto. A motion shall be deemed  unopposed unless timely response is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Before the Immigration Court--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An Immigration  Judge may upon his or her own motion at any   time, or upon motion of the Service or the alien, reopen or reconsider  any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is  vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals. Subject to the exceptions  in this paragraph and paragraph (b)(4), a party may file only one motion  to reconsider and one motion to reopen proceedings. A motion to  reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of a final  administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or  before July 31, 1996, whichever is later. A motion to reopen must be  filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative  order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September  30, 1996, whichever is later. A motion to reopen or to reconsider shall  not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal,  deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure  from the United States. Any departure from the United States, including  the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,  deportation, or removal proceedings, occurring after the filing of a  motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall constitute a withdrawal  of such motion. The time and numerical limitations set forth in this  paragraph do not apply to motions by the Service in removal proceedings  pursuant to section 240 of the Act. Nor shall such limitations apply to  motions by the Service in exclusion or deportation proceedings, when the  basis of the motion is fraud in the original proceeding or a crime that  would support termination of asylum in accordance with Sec. 1208.22(e)  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Form and contents of the motion. The motion shall be in writing  and signed by the affected party or the attorney or representative of  record, if any. The motion and any submission made in conjunction with  it must be in English or accompanied by a certified English translation.  Motions to reopen or reconsider shall state whether the validity of the  exclusion, deportation, or removal order has been or is the subject of  any judicial proceeding and, if so, the nature and date thereof, the  court in which such proceeding took place or is pending, and its result  or status. In any case in which an exclusion, deportation, or removal  order is in effect, any motion to reopen or reconsider such order shall  include a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring  whether the subject of the order is also the subject of any pending  criminal proceeding under the Act, and, if so, the current status of  that proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing. Motions to reopen or reconsider a decision of an  Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having  administrative control over the Record of Proceeding. A motion to reopen  or a motion to reconsider shall include a certificate showing service on  the opposing party of the motion and all attachments. If the moving  party is not the Service, service of the motion shall be made upon the  Office of the District Counsel for the district in which the case was  completed. If the moving party, other than the Service, is represented,  a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative  Before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the motion. The motion  must be filed in duplicate with the Immigration Court, accompanied by a  fee receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assignment to an Immigration Judge. If the Immigration Judge  is unavailable or unable to adjudicate the motion to reopen or  reconsider, the Chief Immigration Judge or his or her delegate shall  reassign such motion to another Immigration Judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Replies to motions; decision. The Immigration Judge may set and  extend time limits for replies to motions to reopen or reconsider. A  motion shall be deemed unopposed unless timely response is made. The  decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider  is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Stays. Except in cases involving in absentia orders, the filing  of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the  execution of any decision made in the case. Execution of such decision  shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the  Immigration Judge, the Board, or an authorized officer of the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider shall state the  reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of   fact or law in the Immigration Judge's prior decision and shall be  supported by pertinent authority. Such motion may not seek  reconsideration of a decision denying previous motion to reconsider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Motion to reopen. A motion to reopen proceedings shall state the  new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is  granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary  material. Any motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an  application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate  application for relief and all supporting documents. A motion to reopen  will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that  evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and  could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. A  motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity  to apply for any form of discretionary relief will not be granted if it  appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully  explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and an opportunity to  apply therefore was afforded at the hearing, unless the relief is sought  on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the  hearing. Pursuant to section 240A(d)(1) of the Act, a motion to reopen  proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application  for relief under section 240A(a) (cancellation of removal for certain  permanent residents) or 240A(b) (cancellation of removal and adjustment  of status for certain nonpermanent residents) may be granted only if the  alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such  relief prior to the service of a notice to appear, or prior to the  commission of an offense referred to in section 212(a)(2) of the Act  that renders the alien inadmissible or removable under sections  237(a)(2) of the Act or (a)(4), whichever is earliest. The Immigration  Judge has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party  has established a prima facie case for relief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions to filing deadlines--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Asylum and withholding of  removal. The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section shall not apply if the basis of the motion is to  apply for asylum under section 208 of the Act or withholding of removal  under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding of removal under the  Convention Against Torture, and is based on changed country conditions  arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal  has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and  could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.  The filing of a motion to reopen under this section shall not  automatically stay the removal of the alien. However, the alien may  request a stay and, if granted by the Immigration Judge, the alien shall  not be removed pending disposition of the motion by the Immigration  Judge. If the original asylum application was denied based upon a  finding that it was frivolous, then the alien is ineligible to file  either a motion to reopen or reconsider, or for a stay of removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Order entered in absentia or removal proceedings. An order of  removal entered in absentia or in removal proceedings pursuant to  section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to  reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if  the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of  exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. An  order entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) may be rescinded  upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that  he or she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1)  or (2) of the Act, or the alien demonstrates that he or she was in  Federal or state custody and the failure to appear was through no fault  of the alien. However, in accordance with section 240(b)(5)(B) of the  Act, no written notice of a change in time or place of proceeding shall  be required if the alien has failed to provide the address required  under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The filing of a motion under this  paragraph shall stay the removal of the alien pending disposition of the  motion by the Immigration Judge. An alien may file only one motion  pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Order entered in absentia in deportation or exclusion  proceedings. (A) An   order entered in absentia in deportation proceedings may be rescinded  only upon a motion to reopen filed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if  the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of  exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien (e.g., serious  illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate  relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not  receive notice or if the alien demonstrates that he or she was in  federal or state custody and the failure to appear was through no fault  of the alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A motion to reopen exclusion hearings on the basis that the  Immigration Judge improperly entered an order of exclusion in absentia  must be supported by evidence that the alien had reasonable cause for  his failure to appear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The filing of a motion to reopen under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A)  of this section shall stay the deportation of the alien pending decision  on the motion and the adjudication of any properly filed administrative  appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section shall not apply to a motion to reopen filed pursuant to  the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Jointly filed motions. The time and numerical limitations set  forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a motion to  reopen agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed.
