The letter of intent to charge will be accompanied by a draft NOVA and proposed order, and will give the respondent a specified period of time to contact BIS to discuss settlement of the allegations set forth in the draft NOVA. An administrative enforcement proceeding is not initiated by a letter of intent to charge. If the respondent does not contact BIS within the specified time, or if the respondent requests it, BIS will make its request for initiation of an administrative enforcement proceeding to the Secretary of State in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA).

It will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed. The NOVA will inform the respondent of the right to request a hearing pursuant to Sec. 719.6 of the CWCR, inform the respondent that failure to request such a hearing shall result in the proposed order becoming final and unappealable on signature of the Secretary of State, and provide payment instructions. A copy of the regulations that govern the administrative proceedings will accompany the NOVA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proposed order. A proposed order shall accompany every NOVA, letter of intent to charge, and draft NOVA.
