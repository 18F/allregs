Antenna systems shall be manufactured so  that if all points within the protection zone of an antenna system were  tested by the Insulating Material Effectiveness Test of Sec. 1204.4(d)  of this subpart, and the Antenna-Mast System Test of Sec. 1204.4(e) of  this subpart, the current measured by the current monitoring device  connected to the mast would be no greater than 5.0 milliamperes rms and  no electrical breakdown of the antenna system's insulating material  would occur.</p>
