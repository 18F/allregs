By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, the grantee is providing the certification set out below.</p><p class="depth0">2. The certification set out below is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the Board awards the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the Board, in addition to any other remedies available to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-Free Workplace Act.</p><p class="depth0">3.

If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.</p><p class="depth0">6.

Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</p><p class="depth0">7. If the workplace identified to the Board changes during the performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the Board of the

change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see paragraph five).</p><p class="depth0">8.

This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered workplaces.</p><p class="depth0">Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I.
