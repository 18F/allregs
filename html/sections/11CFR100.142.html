                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. Repayment of a loan of money to a candidate  or a political committee by a State bank, a federally chartered  depository institution (including a national bank) or a depository  institution whose deposits and accounts are insured by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union  Administration is not an expenditure by the lending institution if such  loan is made in accordance with applicable banking laws and regulations  and is made in the ordinary course of business. A loan will be deemed to  be made in the ordinary course of business if it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending  institution for the category of loan involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is made on a basis that assures repayment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is evidenced by a written instrument; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is subject to a due date or amortization schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting. Such loans shall be reported by the political  committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a) and (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Endorsers and guarantors. Each endorser or guarantor shall be  deemed to have contributed that portion of the   total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a  written agreement, except that, in the event of a signature by the  candidate's spouse, the provisions of 11 CFR 100.52(b)(4) shall apply.  Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce  proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or  guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that the loan  agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each  endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered an  expenditure by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the  unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number  of endorsers or guarantors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overdrafts. For the purpose of this section, repayment of an  overdraft made on a checking or savings account of a political committee  shall be considered an expenditure unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overdraft is made on an account that is subject to automatic  overdraft protection; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The overdraft is subject to a definite interest rate and a  definite repayment schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lending institution making the loan has perfected a  security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political  committee receiving the loan; the fair market value of the collateral is  equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as  determined on the date of the loan; and the candidate or political  committee provides documentation to show that the lending institution  has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of  collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate,  personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of  deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on  deposit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as  guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11  CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, 110.20,  part 114 and part 115; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written  agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the  loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments  under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012 or part 9031 through 9039,  contributions, or interest income, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the loan(s) obtained the basis of such funds does  not exceed the amount of pledged funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the  receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political  committee must furnish the lending institution documentation, i.e., cash  flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that  such future funds will be available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A separate depository account is established at the lending  institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or  political committee to access funds in a committee account at another  depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and  the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing  payments, contributions, interest or other income pledged as collateral  into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the  debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the case of public financing payments, the borrower  authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the  payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the  debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section  are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of circumstances  on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was made on a  basis that assures repayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This section shall not apply to loans described in 11 CFR 100.83  and 100.143.  [67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78680, Dec. 26, 2002]</p>
