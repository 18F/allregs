With State office approval, loans may be made or serviced by a county office other than the administrative county office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For loans for renewable biomass storage facilities and cold storage facilities for fruits and vegetables, to the administrative county FSA office that maintains the records of the farm or farms to which the application applies, if the facility will be located on land that has farm records established at the county office. If the commodities will be produced on land that does not have farm records established at the county office, the application must be submitted to the county FSA office that services the county where the facility will be located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request, the applicant must furnish information and documents as the State or county committee deems reasonably necessary to support the

application. This may include financial statements, receipts, bills, invoices, purchase orders, specifications, drawings, plats, or written authorization of access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For sugar storage facility loans, a loan application must be submitted to the county FSA office that maintains the applicant's records. If no such records exist, loan applications must be submitted to the county office serving the headquarters location of the sugar processor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submitting an application does not ensure loan approval nor create any liability on behalf of CCC. Borrowers who authorize delivery, site preparation, or construction actions without an approved loan, do so at their own risk.
