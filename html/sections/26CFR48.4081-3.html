Tax is  imposed on the following removals from a refinery:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A removal of taxable fuel by bulk transfer if the refiner or the  owner of   the taxable fuel immediately before the removal is not a taxable fuel  registrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A removal of taxable fuel at the rack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, see Sec. 40.6302(c)-1(f)(4) of this chapter. For the rule  allowing inspections of facilities where gasohol is produced, see  section 4083.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain refineries. The tax imposed under  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply to a removal of  taxable fuel if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxable fuel is removed from an approved refinery that is  not served by pipeline (other than a pipeline for the receipt of crude  oil) or vessel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxable fuel is received at a facility that is operated by  a taxable fuel registrant and is located within the bulk transfer/ terminal system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The removal from the refinery is by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rail car; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of diesel fuel, a trailer or semi-trailer that is  used exclusively for the transport service described in paragraphs  (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of taxable fuel removed by rail car, the facility  at which the fuel is received is operated by the same person that  operates the refinery from which the fuel was removed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of diesel fuel removed by a trailer or semi-trailer,  the facility at which the fuel is received is less than 20 miles from  the refinery from which the diesel fuel was removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liability for tax. The refiner is liable for the tax imposed  under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tax on entry into the United States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Imposition of tax. Tax  is imposed on the entry of taxable fuel into the United States if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The entry is by bulk transfer and the enterer is not a taxable  fuel registrant; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The entry is not by bulk transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The enterer is liable for the  tax imposed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Joint and several liability of the importer of record. The  importer of record with respect to the taxable fuel is jointly and  severally liable with the enterer for the tax imposed under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The importer of record is not the enterer of the taxable fuel;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The enterer is not a taxable fuel registrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conditions for avoidance of liability. The importer of record  is not liable for the tax under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section if,  at the time of the entry, the importer of record--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has an unexpired notification certificate (as described in Sec.  48.4081-5) from the enterer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has no reason to believe that any information in the  notification certificate is false.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Customs bond. The Customs bond posted with respect to the  importation of the fuel will not be charged for the tax imposed on the  entry of the fuel if the enterer is a taxable fuel registrant. A Customs  bond will not be charged for the tax imposed on the entry of the fuel  covered by the bond, if at the time of entry, the surety--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has an unexpired notification certificate (as described in Sec.  48.4081-5) from the enterer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has no reason to believe that any information in the  notification certificate is false.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tax on bulk transfers from a terminal by an unregistered  position holder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Imposition of tax. Tax is imposed on the removal by  bulk transfer of taxable fuel from a terminal if the position holder  with respect to the taxable fuel is not a taxable fuel registrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The position holder with  respect to the taxable fuel is liable for the tax imposed under  paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Joint and several liability of terminal operator.

An owner of taxable fuel  is not liable for tax under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section if, at  the time the taxable fuel is removed from the pipeline or vessel, the  owner of the taxable fuel--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is a taxable fuel registrant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has an unexpired notification certificate (described in Sec.  48.4081-5) from the operator of the terminal or refinery where the  taxable fuel is received; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has no reason to believe that any information in the  notification certificate is false.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Liability of the operator of the facility where the taxable  fuel is received. The operator of the facility where the taxable fuel is  received is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (e)(1) of this  section if the owner of the taxable fuel has met the conditions of  paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and is jointly and severally liable  for the tax if the owner has not met such conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Tax on sales within the bulk transfer/terminal system--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Imposition of tax. Tax is imposed on the sale of taxable fuel located  within the bulk transfer/terminal system if the sale is to a person that  is not a taxable fuel registrant and tax has not been imposed on such  taxable fuel under Sec. 48.4081-2, or paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain sales of taxable fuel for export. The tax  imposed under paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to a sale  of taxable fuel if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The buyer's principal place of business is not within the United  States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sale of the fuel occurs as the fuel is delivered into a  transport vessel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel has a capacity of at least 20,000 barrels of fuel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The seller is a taxable fuel registrant and the exporter of  record of the fuel; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The fuel was exported in due course.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liability for tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The seller of the taxable  fuel is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (f)(1) of this  section if the seller has not met the conditions of paragraph (f)(3)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions for avoidance of liability. A seller is not liable  for tax under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section if, at the time of the  sale, the seller--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is a taxable fuel registrant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has an unexpired notification certificate (described in Sec.  48.4081-5) from the buyer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has no reason to believe that any information in the certificate  is false.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Liability of the buyer. The buyer of the taxable fuel is  liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if the  seller of the taxable fuel has met the conditions of paragraph  (f)(3)(ii) of this section and is jointly and severally liable for the  tax if the seller has not met such conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)  and the definition of the term sale in Sec. 48.4081-1:</p><p class="depth0">Example. PH owns one million gallons of untaxed gasoline that is  stored in TO's terminal. PH also is the position holder with respect to  the gasoline. While the gasoline remains stored in the terminal, PH  transfers title to 200,000 gallons of the gasoline to A, a person that  is not a taxable fuel registrant. PH continues to hold the inventory  position on TO's records with respect to the one million gallons.  Because PH continues as the position holder with respect to the  gasoline, the transfer of title to the gasoline from PH to A is not a  sale of gasoline. Because this transfer of title from PH to A is not a  sale of gasoline, the tax imposed under paragraph (f) of this section  does not apply to the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Tax on removal or sale of blended taxable fuel by the blender-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Imposition of tax. A tax is imposed on the removal or sale of  blended taxable fuel by the blender thereof. Tax is computed on the  difference between the total number of gallons of blended taxable fuel  removed or sold and the number of gallons of previously taxed taxable  fuel used to produce the blended taxable fuel. For this purpose, the  alcohol in gasohol is treated as previously taxed taxable fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Liability of the blender. The blender is  liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liability of seller of untaxed liquid. On and after April 2,  2003, a person that sells any liquid that is used to produce blended  taxable fuel is jointly and severally liable for the tax imposed under  paragraph (g)(1) of this section on the removal or sale of that blended  taxable fuel if the liquid--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is described in Sec. 48.4081-1(c)(1)(i)(B) (relating to liquids  on which tax has not been imposed under section 4081); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is sold by that person as gasoline, diesel fuel, or kerosene  that has been taxed under section 4081.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (g) and the definitions of blended taxable fuel and  diesel fuel in Sec. 48.4081-1(c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B))</em> and delivers the liquid into a storage tank (tank) at R's  retail facility. However, W's invoice to R states that the liquid is  undyed diesel fuel. At the time of the delivery, the tank contains 4,000  gallons of undyed diesel fuel, a taxable fuel that has been taxed under  section 4081. The resulting 5,000 gallon mixture is suitable for use as  a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle because it has practical and  commercial fitness for use in the propulsion engine of a diesel-powered  highway vehicle. The mixture does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of  Sec. 48.4082-1. R sells the mixture from the tank to a construction  company for off-highway business use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Production of blended taxable fuel. R is a  blender within the meaning of Sec. 48.4081-1 because R has produced  blended taxable fuel, as defined in Sec. 48.4081-1, by mixing 1,000  gallons of a liquid that has not been taxed under section 4081 with  4,000 gallons of diesel fuel that has been taxed under section 4081. The  mixing occurs outside of the bulk transfer/terminal system and the  resulting product is diesel fuel because it is suitable for use as a  fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Imposition of tax. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, tax  is imposed on R's sale of the 5,000 gallons of blended taxable fuel to  the construction company. Even though the blended taxable fuel is sold  for off-highway business use, which is a nontaxable use as defined in  section 4082(b), the sale is not exempt from tax because the blended  taxable fuel does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of Sec. 48.4082- 1. Tax is computed on 1,000 gallons, which is the difference between the  number of gallons of blended taxable fuel R sells (5,000) and the number  of gallons of previously taxed taxable fuel used to produce the blended  taxable fuel (4,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Liability for tax. R, as the blender, is liable for this tax  under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. W is jointly and severally  liable for this tax under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section because  the blended taxable fuel is produced using an untaxed liquid that W sold  as undyed diesel fuel (that is, as diesel fuel that was taxed under  section 4081).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B))</em>. However, X's invoice to W  states that the liquid is undyed diesel fuel. This liquid is delivered  into the tank trailer already containing the 7,000 gallons of diesel  fuel. The resulting 8,000 gallon mixture is suitable for use as a fuel  in a diesel-powered highway vehicle because it has practical and  commercial fitness for use in the propulsion engine of a diesel-powered  highway vehicle. The   mixture does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of Sec. 48.4082-1. W  sells the mixture to R, a retailer of petroleum products, and delivers  the mixture into a storage tank at R's retail facility. R sells the  mixture to its customers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Production of blended taxable fuel. W is a  blender within the meaning of Sec. 48.4081-1 because W has produced  blended taxable fuel, as defined in Sec. 48.4081-1, by mixing 1,000  gallons of a liquid that has not been taxed under section 4081 with  7,000 gallons of diesel fuel that has been taxed under section 4081. The  mixing occurs outside of the bulk transfer/terminal system and the  resulting product is diesel fuel because it is suitable for use as a  fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle. Thus, R has bought blended  taxable fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Imposition of tax. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, tax  is imposed on W's sale of the 8,000 gallons of blended taxable fuel to  R. Tax is computed on 1,000 gallons, which is the difference between the  number of gallons of blended taxable fuel W sells (8,000) and the number  of gallons of previously taxed taxable fuel used to produce the blended  taxable fuel (7,000). No tax is imposed on R's subsequent sale of the  blended taxable fuel because tax is imposed only with respect to a  removal or sale by the blender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Liability for tax. W, as the blender, is liable for this tax  under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. X is jointly and severally  liable for this tax under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section because  the blended taxable fuel is produced using an untaxed liquid that X sold  as undyed diesel fuel (that is, as diesel fuel that was taxed under  section 4081). R has no liability for tax because R is not a blender and  did not sell any untaxed liquid as a taxed taxable fuel. R only sold  taxed taxable fuel, the blended taxable fuel bought from W.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rate of tax. For the rate of tax generally imposed under this  section, see section 4081(a). For the rate of tax on gasohol and on  gasoline removed or entered for gasohol production, see Sec. 48.4081-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemptions. For exemptions from the taxes imposed under this  section, see Sec. Sec. 48.4081-4 (relating to gasoline blendstocks),  48.4082-1 (relating to dyed diesel fuel and dyed kerosene), 48.4082-5  (relating to diesel fuel and kerosene used in Alaska), 48.4082-6  (relating to aviation-grade kerosene), and 48.4082-7 (relating to  kerosene used for a feedstock purpose).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability date: This section is applicable January  1, 1994, except that paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section  are applicable to entries of taxable fuel after September 27, 2004.
