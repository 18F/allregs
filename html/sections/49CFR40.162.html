For example, if you verified the specimen as being positive for marijuana and cocaine and as being a refusal to test because the specimen was also adulterated, as the MRO, you should report the positives and the refusal to the DER.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the testing event was one in which two separate specimen collections (e.g., a specimen out of temperature range and the subsequent observed collection) were sent to the laboratory, as the MRO, you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If both specimens were verified negative, report the result as negative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If either of the specimens was verified negative and the other was verified as one or more non-negative(s), report the non-negative result(s) only. For example, if you verified one specimen as negative and the other as a refusal to test because the second specimen was substituted, as the MRO you should report only the refusal to the DER.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the first specimen is reported as negative, but the result of the second specimen has not been reported by the laboratory, as the MRO, you should hold--not report--the result of the first specimen until the result of the second specimen is received.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the first specimen is reported as non-negative, as the MRO, you should report the result immediately

and not wait to receive the result of the second specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If both specimens were verified non-negative, report all of the non-negative results. For example, if you verified one specimen as positive and the other as a refusal to test because the specimen was adulterated, as the MRO, you should report the positive and the refusal results to the DER.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As an exception to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as the MRO, you must follow procedures at Sec. 40.159(f) when any verified non-negative result is also invalid.
