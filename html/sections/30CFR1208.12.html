The purchaser shall tender all payments to ONRR in accordance with Sec. 1218.51 of this chapter.

The interest for late payment and underpayment will be assessed pursuant to Sec. 1218.54 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If payment for royalty oil is not received by the due date specified in the contract, a notice of nonreceipt will be sent to the purchaser by certified mail. If payment is not received by ONRR within 15 days from the date of such notice, ONRR may cancel the contract and collect under the ONRR-specified surety instrument. See Sec. 1208.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the purchaser disagrees with the amount of payment due, it must pay the amount due as computed by ONRR, unless the purchaser appeals the amount and posts an ONRR-specified surety instrument pursuant to the provisions of 30 CFR part 1243. The ONRR may, at its discretion, waive the appeal surety requirements if it determines that the contract surety instrument is sufficient protection for an amount under appeal.
