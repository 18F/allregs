                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delay of repair of equipment for which a control equipment failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been identified, is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, as defined in Sec. 63.101 of subpart F of this

part, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material from immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next shutdown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delay of repair of equipment for which a control equipment failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been identified, is allowed if the equipment is emptied or is no longer used to treat or manage Group 1 wastewater streams or residuals removed from Group 1 wastewater streams.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delay of repair of equipment for which a control equipment failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been identified is also allowed if additional time is necessary due to the unavailability of parts beyond the control of the owner or operator. Repair shall be completed as soon as practical. The owner or operator who uses this provision shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.147(b)(7) to document the reasons that the delay of repair was necessary.
