                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General disposal requirements. All sweepings, solid or liquid wastes, refuse, and garbage in a camp must be removed in such a manner as to avoid creating a menace to health and as often as necessary or appropriate to maintain a sanitary condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General waste receptacles. Any exterior receptacle used for putrescible solid or liquid waste or refuse in a camp shall be so constructed that it does not leak and may be thoroughly cleaned and maintained in a sanitary condition. Such a receptacle must be equipped with a solid tight-fitting cover, unless it can be maintained in a sanitary condition without a cover. This requirement does not prohibit the use of receptacles designed to permit the maintenance of a sanitary condition without regard to the aforementioned requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Food waste disposal containers provided for the interior of camp cars. An adequate number of receptacles constructed of smooth, corrosion resistant, easily cleanable, or disposable materials, must be provided and used for the disposal of waste food. Receptacles must be provided with a solid, tight-fitting cover unless sanitary conditions can be maintained without use of a cover. The number, size, and location of such receptacles must encourage their use and not result in overfilling. They must be emptied regularly and maintained in a clean, safe, and sanitary condition.</p>
