                            <p class="depth0">In some cases, owners have been allowed to store personal property,

owned by them or under their control, on premises leased from such owners by the Government, the personal property not being covered by the lease. The rooms in which this property was stored have been broken into and, upon termination of the lease, it has been found that much of the property is damaged or is missing. Unless the lease specifically places some responsibility on the Government, payment for such damaged or missing property cannot be included in restoration settlements for payment. In the event the lessor refuses to sign a full release, a provision may be included in the supplemental agreement releasing the Government from all liability except for claims for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property stored on the leased premises and not covered by the lease, and the lessor advised that he may submit a claim for the amounts which he considers due him.</p>
