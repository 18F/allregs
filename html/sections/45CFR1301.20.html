Under the circumstances described in clause</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Of the preceding sentence, the agency is entitled to receive the same percentage of Federal financial assistance that it received during such budget periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The non-Federal share will not be required to exceed 20 percent of the total costs of the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal financial assistance awarded to Head Start grantees for training and technical assistance activities shall be included in the Federal share in determining the total approved costs of the program. Such financial assistance is, therefore, subject to the 20 percent non-Federal matching requirement of this subpart.
