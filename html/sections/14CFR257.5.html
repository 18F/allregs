                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice in schedules. In written or electronic schedule information provided by carriers in the United States to the public, the Official Airline Guides and comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservations systems, carriers involved in code-sharing arrangements or long-term wet leases shall ensure that each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier is identified by an asterisk or other easily identifiable mark and that the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which that service is held out to the public is also disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oral notice to prospective consumers. In any direct oral communication in the United States with a prospective consumer and in any telephone calls placed from the United States concerning a flight that is part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket agent doing business in the United States or a carrier shall tell the consumer, before booking transportation, that the transporting carrier is not the carrier whose designator code will appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written notice. Except as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, at the time of purchase, each selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide each consumer of scheduled passenger air transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease with the following notice:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an itinerary is issued, there shall appear in conjunction with the listing of any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier a legend that states ``Operated by'' followed by the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name in which that service is held out to the public. In the case of single-flight-number service involving a segment or segments on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier, the notice shall clearly identify the segment or segments and the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name in which that service is held out to the public. The following form of statement will satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth3">Important Notice: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines d/b/a QRS Express.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no itinerary is issued, the selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide a separate written notice that clearly identifies the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name under which that service is held out to the public for any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. The following form of notice will satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (c)(2):</p><p class="depth3">Important Notice: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines d/b/a QRS Express.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If transportation is purchased far enough in advance of travel to allow for advance delivery of the ticket by mail or otherwise, the written notice required by this part shall be delivered in advance along with the ticket. If time does not allow for advance delivery of the ticket, or in the case of ticketless travel, the written notice required by this part shall be provided no later than the time that they check in at the airport for the first flight in their itinerary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the purchaser's request, the notice required by this part may be delivered in person or by telecopier, electronic mail, or any other reliable

method of transmitting written material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In any printed advertisement published in or mailed to or from the United States (including those published through the Internet) for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall prominently disclose that the advertised service may involve travel on another carrier and clearly indicate the nature of the service in reasonably sized type and shall identify all potential transporting carriers involved in the markets being advertised by corporate name and by any other name under which that service is held out to the public. In any radio or television advertisement broadcast in the United States for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall include at least a generic disclosure statement, such as ``Some services are provided by other airlines.''
