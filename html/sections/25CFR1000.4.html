                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Congressional findings. In the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, the Congress found that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Tribal right of self-governance flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and nations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes, including the right of the Tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian Tribes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Although progress had been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, had eroded Tribal self-governance and dominated Tribal affairs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between

Indian Tribes and the United States and to strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance demonstration project and finds that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon Tribal request, for Federal programs is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon request, for Federal programs strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Congressional declaration of policy. It is the policy of the Tribal Self-Governance Act to permanently establish and implement self-governance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To permit each Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indian individuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> To permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> To provide for an orderly transition through a planned and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Secretarial self-governance policies. (1) It is the policy of the Secretary to fully support and implement the foregoing policies to the full extent of the Secretary's authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary to recognize and respect the unique government-to-government relationship between Tribes, as sovereign governments, and the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department work cooperatively and pro-actively with Tribes and Tribal Consortia on a government-to-government basis within the framework of the Act and any other applicable provision of law, so as to make the ideals of self-determination and self-governance a reality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department actively share information with Tribes and Tribal Consortia to encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to become knowledgeable about the Department's programs and the opportunities to include them in an annual funding agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary that all bureaus of the Department will negotiate in good faith, interpret each applicable Federal law and regulation in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of programs in each annual funding agreement authorized, and enter into such annual funding agreements under Title IV, whenever possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary to afford Tribes and Tribal Consortia the maximum flexibility and discretion necessary to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious, and institutional needs. These policies are designed to facilitate and encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs, included, or eligible for inclusion in an annual funding agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary, to the extent of the Secretary's authority, to maintain active communication with Tribal governments regarding budgetary matters applicable to programs subject to the Act, and that are included in an individual self-governance annual funding agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> It is the policy of the Secretary to implement policies, procedures, and practices at the Department to ensure that the letter, spirit, and goals of the Tribal Self-Governance Act are fully and successfully implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Executive Order 13084 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and any subsequent Executive Orders regarding consultation will apply to the implementation of these regulations.</p>
