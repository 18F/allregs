                            <p class="depth0">The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for  a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under  Sec. 97.383 is submitted in accordance with the following, to the  extent provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in  accordance with Sec. 51.123(ee)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this chapter  and approved by the Administrator:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and  the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency  of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR  opt-in permit under Sec. 97.383. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for  purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information  demonstrating that the NOX emissions rate and heat input of  the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported  in accordance with subpart HHHH of this part. A determination of  sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the  monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring and reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the permitting authority and  the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under  paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and  report the NOX emissions rate and the heat input of the unit  and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HHHH of  this part, starting on the date   of certification of the appropriate monitoring systems under subpart  HHHH of this part and continuing until a CAIR opt-in permit is denied  under Sec. 97.384(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in permit is issued, the date  and time when the unit is withdrawn from the CAIR NOX Ozone  Season Trading Program in accordance with Sec. 97.386.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section shall include the entire control period immediately before the  date on which the unit enters the CAIR NOX Ozone Season  Trading Program under Sec. 97.384(g), during which period monitoring  system availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HHHH  of this part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable  State or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent the NOX emissions rate and the heat  input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart  HHHH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the  control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which  control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90  percent under subpart HHHH of this part and the unit is in full  compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions- related requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3  years before the unit enters the CAIR NOX Ozone Season  Trading Program under Sec. 97.384(g), such information shall be used as  provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu)  for the control period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Baseline NOX emission rate. The unit's baseline NOX  emission rate shall equal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the unit's NOX emissions  rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the unit's NOX emissions rate and heat input are  monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance  with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on  NOX emission controls during any such control periods, the  average of the amounts of the unit's NOX emissions rate (in  lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on  NOX emission controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline  heat input and the baseline NOX emissions rate for the unit  under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting  authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that  the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NOX Ozone Season  opt-in unit in Sec. 97.380 and meets the elements certified in Sec.  97.383(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit.  The permitting authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit  to the Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for  the source that includes the CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in  unit unless the source already has a compliance account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before  issuance of a CAIR opt-in   permit for the unit, the permitting authority determines that the CAIR  designated representative fails to show that the unit meets the  requirements for a CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit in Sec.  97.380 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 97.383(a)(2), the  permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Date of entry into CAIR NOX Ozone Season Trading  Program. A unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the  permitting authority shall become a CAIR NOX Ozone Season  opt-in unit, and a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit, as of the  later of May 1, 2009 or May 1 of the first control period during which  such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Repowered CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If  CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority  issues a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR  NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit of CAIR NOX Ozone  Season allowances under Sec. 97.388(c) and such unit is repowered after  its date of entry into the CAIR NOX Ozone Season Trading  Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit shall be  treated as a CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit replacing the  original CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit, as of the date of  start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of  the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the  repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of  operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat  input, and baseline NOX emission rate as the original CAIR  NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit, and the original CAIR  NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit shall no longer be treated as a  CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in unit or a CAIR NOX  Ozone Season unit.
