In support of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license is required to export any commodity controlled by ECCN 0A983 to all destinations including Canada.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing policy. Applications for such licenses will generally be denied to all destinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract sanctity. The contract sanctity date is November 9, 1995.

In maintaining its controls on specially designed instruments of torture the United States considers international norms regarding human rights and the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from controls imposed by other countries.
