Excluded are a Farm Credit System association or other financing institution that comply with the criteria in section 1.7(b) of the Act and the regulations in subpart P of this part. For the purposes of this subpart, the term ``borrower'' includes any customer to whom an institution has made a lease or a commitment to make a lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commitment means a legally binding obligation to extend credit, enter into lease financing, purchase or participate in loans or leases, or pay the obligation of another, which becomes effective at the time such commitment is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan means any extension of, or commitment to extend, credit authorized under the Act whether it results from direct negotiations between a lender and a borrower or is purchased from or discounted for another lender. This includes participation interests. The term ``loan'' includes loans and leases outstanding, obligated but undisbursed commitments to lend or

lease, contracts of sale, notes receivable, other similar obligations, guarantees, and all types of leases. An institution ``makes a loan or lease'' when it enters into a commitment to lend or lease, advances new funds, substitutes a different borrower or lessee for a borrower or lessee who is released, or where any other person's liability is added to the outstanding loan, lease or commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Primary liability means an obligation to repay that is not conditioned upon an unsuccessful prior demand on another party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Secondary liability means an obligation to repay that only arises after an unsuccessful demand on another party.
