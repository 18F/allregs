A company may increase or decrease its essential-use allowances for CFCs for use in essential MDIs according to the provisions under this paragraph (c). A nation listed in appendix C to this subpart (Parties to the Montreal Protocol) must agree either to transfer to the person for the current control period some amount of production or import that the nation is permitted under the Montreal Protocol or to receive from the person for the current control period some amount of production or import that the person is permitted under this subpart. If the controlled substance is produced under the authority of production allowances and is to be returned to the Party from whom production allowances are received, the request for production allowances shall also be considered a request for consumption allowances under Sec. 82.10(c). If the controlled substance is produced under the authority of production allowances and is to be sold in the United States or to another Party (not the Party from whom the allowances are received), the U.S. company must expend its consumption allowances allocated under Sec. 82.6 and Sec. 82.7 in order to produce with the additional production allowances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from the principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy in the United States a signed document stating that the appropriate authority within that nation has established or revised production limits or essential-use allowance limits for the nation to equal the lesser of the maximum production that the nation is allowed under the Protocol minus the amount transferred, the maximum production or essential-use allowances that are allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus the amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual national production level for the three years prior to the transfer minus the production transferred.

For a trade from a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the allowances held by the person to equal the unexpended production, Article 5, or essential-use allowances held by the person under this subpart plus the level of allowable production transferred from the Party. For a trade to a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the production limit for the person to equal the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unexpended production allowances, essential-use allowances, or Article 5 allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The unexpended production allowances, essential-use allowances, or Article 5 allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the United States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total production allowable for that substance under this subpart minus the amount transferred.

The change in production allowances or Article 5 allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective January 1, 1996, there will be no trade in production or consumption allowances with other Parties to the Protocol for class I controlled substances, except for class I, Group VI, methyl bromide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005 for class I, Group VI, a person may obtain production allowances for that controlled substance equal to the amount of that controlled substance produced in the United States that was transformed or destroyed within the United States, or transformed or destroyed by a person of another Party, in the cases where production allowances were expended to produce such substance in the U.S. in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. A request for production allowances under this section will be considered a request for consumption allowances under Sec. 82.10(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, a person must submit a request for production allowances that includes the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting the allowances, and the Employer Identification Number if the controlled substance is being exported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name, quantity, and level of controlled substance transformed or the name, quantity and volume destroyed, and the commodity code if the substance was exported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of the controlled substance, including the name, address, contact person and telephone number of the transformer or destroyer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A certification that production allowances were expended for the production of the controlled substance, and the date of purchase, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the controlled substance is transformed, the name, quantity, and verification of the commercial use of the resulting chemical and a copy of the IRS certificate of intent to use the controlled substance as a feedstock; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the controlled substance is destroyed, the verification of the destruction efficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, the Administrator will review the information and documentation submitted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and will assess the quantity of class I controlled substance that the documentation and information verifies was transformed or destroyed. The Administrator will issue the person production allowances equivalent to the controlled substances that the Administrator determines were transformed or destroyed. For controlled substances completely destroyed under this rule, the Agency will grant allowances equal to 100 percent of volume intended for destruction. For those controlled substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, the Agency will grant allowances commensurate with that percentage of destruction efficiency that is actually achieved.

will issue a notice disallowing the request for additional production allowances. Within ten working days after receipt of notification, the person may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the disallowance or grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light of the available evidence.

For controlled substances completely destroyed under this rule, the Agency will grant destruction credits equal to 100 percent of volume destroyed minus the offset. For those controlled substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, the Agency will grant destruction credits commensurate with that percentage of destruction efficiency that is actually achieved minus the offset.

Within ten working days after receipt of notification, the person may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the disallowance or grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light of the available evidence. If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after notification, the disallowance will be final on that day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> International transfer of essential-use CFCs. (1) For trades of essential-use CFCs where the transferee or the transferor is a person in another nation (Party), the persons involved in the transfer must submit the information requested in Sec. 82.12(d)(2) and (d)(3), along with a signed document from the principal diplomatic representative in the Party's embassy in the United

States stating that the appropriate authority within that nation has approved the transfer of the essential-use CFCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the transfer claim is complete, and EPA does not object to the transfer, then EPA will issue letters to the transferor and the transferee indicating that the transfer may proceed. EPA reserves the right to disallow a transfer if the transfer request is incomplete, or if it has reason to believe that the transferee plans to produce MDIs that are not essential MDIs. If EPA objects to the transfer, EPA will issue letters to the transferor and transferee stating the basis for disallowing the transfer. The burden of proof is placed on the transferee to retain sufficient records to prove that the transferred essential-use CFCs are used only for production of essential MDIs. If EPA ultimately finds that the transferee did not use the essential-use CFCs for production of essential MDIs then the transferee is in violation of this subpart.
