Recharge cylinder if weight loss exceeds 10 percent of the weight of the charge. Test time delays, alarms, and ventilation shutdowns with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other nonflammable gas as stated in the system manufacturer's instruction manual. Inspect hoses for damage or decay. Ensure that nozzles are unobstructed. Cylinders must be tested and marked, and all flexible connections on fixed carbon dioxide systems must be tested or renewed, as required by 46 CFR 147.60 and 147.65.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Halon 1301 or Halocarbon: Recharge or replace if weight loss exceeds 5 percent of the weight of the charge or, if cylinder has a pressure gauge, recharge cylinder if pressure loss exceeds 10 percent, adjusted for temperature. Test time delays, alarms, and ventilation shutdowns with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other nonflammable gas as stated in the system manufacturer's instruction manual. Inspect hoses for damage or decay. Ensure that nozzles are unobstructed. Cylinders must be tested and marked, and all flexible Halon 1301 and halocarbon connections must be tested or renewed as required by 46 CFR 147.60 and 147.65 or 147.67. Note that Halon 1301 system approvals have expired, but that existing systems may be retained if they are in good and serviceable condition to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inert gas: Recharge or replace cylinder if cylinder pressure loss exceeds 5 percent of specified gauge pressure, adjusted for temperature. Test time delays, alarms, and ventilation shutdowns with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other nonflammable gas as stated in the system manufacturer's instruction manual. Inspect hoses for damage or decay. Ensure that nozzles are unobstructed. Cylinders must be tested and marked, and all flexible connections must be tested or renewed as required by 46 CFR 147.60 and 147.66.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foam, except premix systems: Discharge foam for approximately 15 seconds from a nozzle designated by the marine inspector. Discharge water from all other lines and nozzles. Submit a sample of the foam liquid to the manufacturer or its authorized representative for determination of specific gravity, pH, percentage of water

dilution, and solid content and for certification as a suitable firefighting foam.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Premix aqueous film forming foam: Remove the pressure cartridge and replace the cartridge if the seal is punctured, sampling the premix solution in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and replacing any cylinders that are discharged.
