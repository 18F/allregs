The Corporation may  terminate or revoke assistance for failure to comply with applicable  terms and conditions of this chapter. However, the Corporation must  provide the recipient reasonable notice and opportunity for a full and  fair hearing, subject to the following conditions: (1) The Corporation  will notify a recipient of assistance by letter or telegram that the  Corporation intends to terminate or revoke assistance, either in whole  or in part, unless the recipient shows good cause why   such assistance should not be terminated or revoked. In this  communication, the grounds and the effective date for the proposed  termination or revocation will be described. The recipient will be given  at least 7 calendar days to submit written material in opposition to the  proposed action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The recipient may request a hearing on a proposed termination or  revocation. Providing five days notice to the recipient, the Corporation  may authorize the conduct of a hearing or other meetings at a location  convenient to the recipient to consider the proposed suspension or  termination. A transcript or recording must be made of a hearing  conducted under this section and be available for inspection by any  individual.</p>
