[Comment: In addition to the requirements of subparts A through E of this part, the owner or operator of a facility which disposes of hazardous waste by underground injection ultimately must comply with the requirements of Secs. 265.431 through 265.437. These sections are reserved at this time. The Agency will propose regulations that would establish those requirements.]
