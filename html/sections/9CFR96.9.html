                            <p class="depth0">Foreign animal casings offered for importation into the United States which are admitted upon disinfection shall be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The containers of such casings shall be sealed on the steamship pier or other place of first arrival. Four seals shall be affixed to both ends of each tierce, barrel, and similar container in the space where the ends of the container enter the staves, by means of red sealing wax imprinted with the No. 3 Veterinary Services brass brand from

which ``insp'd & p's'd'' and the establishment number have been removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Uncertified animal casings sealed as above indicated shall be transferred from the steamship pier or other place of first arrival to the premises of the importer or other designated place, where they shall be disinfected by the importer under the supervision of an APHIS inspector before they are offered for sale. The object of this ruling is to place full responsibility for disinfection of casings on the original importer and to prevent the sale of casings subject to disinfection by the purchaser.
