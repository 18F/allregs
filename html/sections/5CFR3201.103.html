                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition on acquisition, ownership, or control. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no employee, spouse of an employee, or minor child of an employee may acquire, own, or control, directly or indirectly, a security of any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bank or savings association that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A bank holding company that is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A savings and loan holding company that is subject to supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A financial holding company that is subject to FRB supervision; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A company that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Owns or controls an FDIC-insured bank or savings association;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is neither an FRB-supervised bank holding company, an OTS-supervised savings and loan holding company, nor an FRB-supervised financial holding company; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is either primarily engaged in banking or not publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section, but subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section, an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, may do any or all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquire, own, or control the securities of a unitary thrift holding company (i.e., a savings and loan holding company that is subject to OTS supervision but whose principal business is neither banking nor activities closely related to banking);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Own or control a security of an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section if the security was permitted to be retained by the employee under 12 CFR part 336 prior to May 25, 1995, was obtained prior to commencement of employment with the Corporation, or was acquired by a spouse prior to marriage to the employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Own, or control a security of an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The security was acquired by inheritance, gift, stock-split, involuntary stock dividend, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate ownership, exercise of preemptive right, or otherwise without specific intent to acquire the security, or, by an employee's spouse or minor child as part of a compensation package in connection with his or her employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee makes full, written disclosure on FDIC form 2410/07 to the Ethics Counselor within 30 days of the commencement of employment or the acquisition of the interest; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee is disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, from participating in any particular matter that affects his or her financial interests, or that of his or her spouse or minor child;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acquire, own, or control an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund provided that, upon initial or subsequent investment by the employee (excluding ordinary dividend reinvestment), the fund does not have invested, or indicate in its prospectus the intent to invest, more than 30 percent of its assets in the securities of one or more entities described in paragraph (a) of this section and the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use an FDIC-insured depository institution or an affiliate of an FDIC-insured depository institution as custodian or trustee of accounts containing tax-deferred retirement funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Divestiture. Based upon a determination of substantial conflict under 5 CFR 2635.403(b), the Ethics Counselor may require an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to divest a security he or she is otherwise authorized to acquire, own, control, or use under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver. The Ethics Counselor may grant a written waiver from any provision of this section based on a determination made with the advice and legal clearance of the Legal Division that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law, and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the FDIC's programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.
