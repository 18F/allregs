                                Sec. 1717.857  Refinancing of existing secured debt--distribution
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Advance approval. All applications for a lien accommodation or  subordination for the refinancing of existing secured debt that meet the  qualification criteria of this paragraph, except applications from  borrowers in default under their mortgage or loan contract with RUS, are  eligible for advance approval. Such lien accommodations and  subordinations are deemed to be in the Government's interest, and RUS  will approve them once RUS is satisfied that the requirements of this  paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section have been met. The  qualification criteria are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The refinancing is a current refunding and does not involve  interest rate swaps, forward delivery contracts, or similar features;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principal amount of the refinancing loan does not exceed the  sum of the outstanding principal amount of the debt being refinanced  plus the amount of transactions costs included in the refinancing loan  that are eligible for lien accommodation or subordination under  Sec. 1717.852(a)(4);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The weighted average life of the refinancing loan is not greater  than the weighted average remaining life of the loan being refinanced;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The present value of the cost of the refinancing loan, including  all transaction costs and any required investments in the lender, is  less than the present value of the cost of the loan being refinanced, as  determined by a method acceptable to RUS. The discount rate used in the  present value analysis shall be equal to either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The current rate on Treasury securities having a maturity equal  to the weighted average life of the refunding loan, plus one-eighth  percent, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A rate approved by RUS based on documentation provided by the  borrower as to its marginal long-term borrowing cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other applications. Applications for a lien accommodation or  subordination for refinancing that do not meet the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section will be reviewed by RUS under normal  review procedures for these applications. In the case of either advance  approval or normal review, a lien subordination would be authorized only  if the lien of the mortgage was subordinated with respect to the assets  securing the loan being refinanced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application contents--advance approval of refinancing.  Applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing  of existing secured debt that meet the qualification criteria for  advance approval set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, must  include the following information and documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that  the application meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section  and all applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 1717.852 and 1717.853;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation and analysis demonstrating that the application  meets the qualification criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A resolution of the borrower's board of directors requesting the  lien accommodation or subordination and including the amount and  maturity of the proposed loan, a general description of the debt to be  refinanced, the name and address of the lender, and an attached term  sheet summarizing the terms and conditions of the proposed loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in  which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application  is received by RUS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment  (supplement) required by RUS or the lender, unless RUS has notified the  borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing  instrument, unless RUS has notified the borrower that these documents  need not be submitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and  Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered Transactions, as required  by 2 CFR part 417:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent  on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the  delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not  previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the  Government's collection options; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other information, documents and opinions that RUS may require  to determine whether all of the applicable provisions of this subpart  have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application contents--normal review of refinancing. Applications  for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing of existing  secured debt that do not meet the requirements for advance approval set  forth in paragraph (a) of this section, must include the following  information and documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information and documents set forth in paragraphs (c)(3)  through (9) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A complete description of the refinancing loan and the  outstanding debt to be refinanced;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An analysis comparing the refinancing loan with the loan being  refinanced as to the weighted average life and the net present value of  the costs of the two loans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the present value of the cost of the refinancing loan is  greater than the present value of the cost of the debt being refinanced,  financial forecasts for at least 5 years comparing the borrower's debt  service and other costs, revenues, margins, cash flows, TIER, and DSC,  with and without the proposed refinancing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application process and timeframes. The application process and  timeframes for RUS review and action for refinancings are set forth in  Sec. 1717.859(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prepayments of concurrent RUS insured loans. If the loan being  refinanced was made concurrently as supplemental financing required by  RUS in connection with an RUS insured loan, the refinancing will not be  considered a prepayment under the RUS mortgage, and no proportional  prepayment of the concurrent RUS insured loan will be required, provided  that the principal amount of the refinancing loan is not less than the  amount of loan principal being refinanced, and the weighted average life  of the refinancing loan is materially equal to the weighted average  remaining life of the loan being refinanced. The refinancing loan shall  be considered a concurrent loan.  [58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 67410, Dec. 29, 1995;  79 FR 76003, Dec. 19, 2014]</p>
