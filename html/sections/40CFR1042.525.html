                                Sec.  1042.525  How do I adjust emission levels to account for
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to adjust emission results from engines  using aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration events. See  paragraph (e) of this section for how to adjust ramped-modal testing.  See paragraph (f) of this section for how to adjust discrete-mode  testing. For this section, ``regeneration'' means an intended event  during which emission levels change while the system restores  aftertreatment performance. For example, exhaust gas temperatures may  increase temporarily to remove sulfur from adsorbers or to oxidize  accumulated particulate matter in a trap. For this section,  ``infrequent'' refers to regeneration events that are expected to occur  on average less than once over the applicable transient duty cycle or  ramped-modal cycle, or on average less than once per typical mode in a  discrete-mode test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Developing adjustment factors. Develop an upward adjustment  factor and a downward adjustment factor for each pollutant based on  measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency. Adjustment  factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but you may  develop separate adjustment factors for different engine configurations  within an engine family. If you use adjustment factors for  certification, you must identify the frequency factor, F, from paragraph  (b) of this section in your application for certification and use the  adjustment factors in all testing for that engine family. You may use  carryover or carry-across data to establish adjustment factors for an  engine family, as described in Sec.  1042.235(d), consistent with good  engineering judgment. All adjustment factors for regeneration are  additive. Determine adjustment factors separately for different test  segments. For example, determine separate adjustment factors for  different modes of a discrete-mode steady-state test. You may use either  of the following different approaches for engines that use  aftertreatment with infrequent regeneration events:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may disregard this section if regeneration does not  significantly affect emission levels for an engine family (or  configuration) or if it is not practical to identify when regeneration  occurs. If you do not use adjustment factors under this section, your  engines must meet emission standards for all testing, without regard to  regeneration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your engines use aftertreatment technology with extremely  infrequent regeneration and you are unable to apply the provisions of  this section, you may ask us to approve an alternate methodology to  account for regeneration events.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculating average adjustment factors. Calculate the average  adjustment factor (EFA) based on the following equation:  EFA = (F)(EFH) + (1-F)(EFL)  Where:  F = The frequency of the regeneration event during normal in-use</p><p class="depth2">operation, expressed in terms of the fraction of equivalent</p><p class="depth2">tests during which the regeneration occurs. You may determine</p><p class="depth2">F from in-use operating data or running replicate tests. For</p><p class="depth2">example, if you observe</p><p class="depth2">that the regeneration occurs 125 times during 1,000 MW-hrs of</p><p class="depth2">operation, and your engine typically accumulates 1 MW-hr per</p><p class="depth2">test, F would be (125) / (1,000) / (1) = 0.125. No further</p><p class="depth2">adjustments, including weighting factors, may be applied to F. EFH = Measured emissions from a test segment in which the</p><p class="depth2">regeneration occurs. EFL = Measured emissions from a test segment in which the</p><p class="depth2">regeneration does not occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applying adjustment factors. Apply adjustment factors based on  whether regeneration occurs during the test run. You must be able to  identify regeneration in a way that is readily apparent during all  testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If regeneration does not occur during a test segment, add an  upward adjustment factor to the measured emission rate. Determine the  upward adjustment factor (UAF) using the following equation:  UAF = EFA-EFL</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If regeneration occurs or starts to occur during a test segment,  subtract a downward adjustment factor from the measured emission rate.  Determine the downward adjustment factor (DAF) using the following  equation:  DAF = EFH-EFA</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sample calculation. If EFL is 0.10 g/kW-hr,  EFH is 0.50 g/kW-hr, and F is 0.1 (the regeneration occurs  once for each ten tests), then:  EFA = (0.1)(0.5 g/kW-hr) + (1.0-0.1)(0.1 g/kW-hr) = 0.14 g/ kW-hr. UAF = 0.14 g/kW-hr-0.10 g/kW-hr = 0.04 g/kW-hr. DAF = 0.50 g/kW-hr-0.14 g/kW-hr = 0.36 g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ramped-modal testing. Develop a single sets of adjustment  factors for the entire test. If a regeneration has started but has not  been completed when you reach the end of a test, use good engineering  judgment to reduce your downward adjustments to be proportional to the  emission impact that occurred in the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discrete-mode testing. Develop separate adjustment factors for  each test mode. If a regeneration has started but has not been completed  when you reach the end of the sampling time for a test mode extend the  sampling period for that mode until the regeneration is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Category 3 engines. We may specify an alternate methodology to  account for regeneration events from Category 3 engines. If we do not,  the provisions of this section apply as specified.
