(43.1 x 50.8 cm)'' or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)'', or ``50 bags, 20 in. x 2\1/2\ ft. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)''.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the unit bag is gussetted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth and length in terms of inches except that any dimensions of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal fractions of the foot.</p><p class="depth4">(Examples: ``25 bags, 17 in. x 4 in. x 20 in. (43 x 10 x 50 cm)'', or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 12 in. x 2\1/2\ ft. (50.8 x 30.4 x 76.2 cm)''.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For other square, oblong, rectangular or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width, and depth except depth need not

be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).</p><p class="depth3">(Example: ``2 cake pans, 8 in. x 8 in. (20.3 x 20.3 cm)'', or ``roasting pan, 12 in. x 8 in. x 3 in. (30.4 x 20.3 x 7.62 cm)''.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For circular or other generally round shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed by diameter and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).</p><p class="depth3">(Example: ``4 pie pans, 8 in. diameter (20.3 cm)'' or ``2 cake pans, 8 in. diameter x 4 in. (20.3 x 10.1 cm)''.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the functional use of the container is related by label reference in standard terms of measure to the capability of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity statement and shall specify capacity as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semi-solids, viscous materials or mixtures of solids and liquids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches, quart, pint, or ounce with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.</p><p class="depth3">(Example: Freezer Boxes: ``4 boxes, 1 qt. capacity, 6 in. x 6 in. x 4 in. (946 mL capacity, 15.2 x 15.2 x 10.1 cm)''.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dry measure for containers which are intended to be used for solids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, peck, dry quart, or dry pint with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.</p><p class="depth3">(Example: Leaf Bags: ``8 bags, 6 bushel capacity, 4 feet x 5 feet (211 L capacity--1.21 m x 1.52 m)''.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where containers are used as liners for other more permanent containers, in the same terms as are normally used to express the capacity of the more permanent container.</p><p class="depth3">(Example: Garbage Can Liners: ``10 liners, 2 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. 1 in., fits up to 30 gallon cans (76.2 x 93.9 cm, fits up to 113 L cans''.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding the above requirements, the net quantity statement for containers such as cups will be listed in terms of count and liquid capacity per unit.</p><p class="depth2">(Example: ``24 cups, 6 fl. oz. capacity (177 mL)''.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this section, the use of the terms ``capacity,'' ``diameter,'' and ``fluid'' is optional.</p>
