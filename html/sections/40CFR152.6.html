                                Sec. 152.6  Substances excluded from regulation by FIFRA.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Products and substances listed in this section are excluded from  FIFRA regulation if they meet the specified conditions or criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Liquid chemical sterilants. A liquid chemical sterilant product  is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA if it meets all of the  following criteria. Excluded products are regulated by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA). Products excluded are those meeting all of the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Composition. The product must be in liquid form as sold or  distributed. Pressurized gases or products in dry or semi-solid form are  not excluded by this provision. Ethylene oxide products are not liquid  products and are not excluded by this provision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims. The product must bear a sterilant claim, or a sterilant  plus subordinate level disinfection claim. Products that bear  antimicrobial claims solely at a level less than ``sterilant'' are not  excluded and are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use site. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The product must be intended and labeled only for  use on ``critical or semi-critical devices.'' A ``critical device'' is  any device which is introduced directly into the human body, either into  or in contact with the bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the  body. A semi-critical device is any device which contacts intact mucous  membranes but which does not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or  otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on  non-critical medical devices are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on  sites that are not medical devices, such as veterinary equipment, are  not excluded and are regulated solely by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nitrogen stabilizers. A nitrogen stabilizer is excluded from  regulation under FIFRA if it is a substance (or mixture of substances),  meeting all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The substance prevents or hinders the process of nitrification,  denitrification, ammonia volatilization, or urease production through  action affecting soil bacteria and is distributed and sold solely for  those purposes and no other pesticidal purposes. For purposes of this  section, living organisms are not considered to be substances, and the  actions of living organisms are not relevant to whether a substance is  deemed to be a nitrogen stabilizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The substance was in ``commercial agronomic use'' in the United  States before January 1, 1992. EPA considers a substance to be in  commercial agronomic use if it is available for sale or distribution to  users for direct agronomic benefit, as opposed to limited research,  experimental or demonstration use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The substance was not registered under FIFRA before January 1,  1992.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Since January 1, 1992, the distributor or seller has made no  claim that the product prevents or hinders the process of nitrification,  denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production. EPA  considers any of the following claims (or their equivalents) to be a  claim that the product prevents or hinders nitrification,  denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Improves crop utilization of applied nitrogen.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reduces leaching of applied nitrogen or reduces groundwater  nitrogen contamination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Prevents nitrogen loss.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prolongs availability of nitrogen.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Increases nitrogen uptake, availability, usage, or efficiency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A product will be considered to have met the criterion of  paragraph (b)(4) of this section that no nitrogen stabilization claim  has been made if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nitrogen stabilization claim, in whatever terms expressed,  is made solely in compliance with a State requirement to include the  claim in materials required to be submitted to a State legislative or  regulatory authority, or in the labeling or other literature  accompanying the product; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State requirement to include the claim was in effect both  before the product bearing the claim was introduced into commercial  agronomic use, and before the effective date of this rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A product that meets all of the criteria of this paragraph with  respect to one State is not thereby excluded from FIFRA regulation if  distributed and sold in another State whose nitrogen stabilization  statement requirement does not meet the requirements of paragraph  (b)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Human drugs. Fungi, bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms in  or on living man are not ``pests'' as defined in section 2(t) of FIFRA.  Products intended and labeled for use against such organisms are human  drugs subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Animal drugs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fungi, viruses, bacteria or other  microorganisms on or in living animals are not ``pests'' under section  2(t) of FIFRA. Products intended for use against such organisms are  ``animal drugs'' regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A ``new animal drug'' as defined in section 201(w) of the FFDCA,  or an animal drug that FDA has determined is not a ``new animal drug''  is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. Animal drugs are  regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Animal feeds. An animal feed containing a new animal drug is not  a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. An animal feed containing a new  animal drug is subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vitamin hormone products. A product consisting of a mixture of  plant hormones, plant nutrients, inoculants, or soil amendments is not a  ``plant regulator'' under section 2(v) of FIFRA, provided it meets the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The product, in the undiluted package concentration at which it  is distributed or sold, meets the criteria of Sec. 156.62 of this  chapter for Toxicity Category III or IV; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The product is not intended for use on food crop sites, and is  labeled accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Products intended to aid the growth of desirable plants. A  product of any of the following types, intended only to aid the growth  of desirable plants, is not a ``plant regulator'' under section 2(v) of  FIFRA, and therefore is not a pesticide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A plant nutrient product, consisting of one or more  macronutrients or micronutrient trace elements necessary to normal  growth of plants and in a form readily usable by plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A plant inoculant product consisting of microorganisms to be  applied to the plant or soil for the purpose of enhancing the  availability or uptake of plant nutrients through the root system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A soil amendment product containing a substance or substances  intended for the purpose of improving soil characteristics favorable for  plant growth.
