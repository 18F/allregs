A petition, however, may  not request a post-grant review for a claim in a reissue patent that is  identical to or narrower than a claim in the original patent from which  the reissue patent was issued unless the petition is filed not later  than the date that is nine months after the date of the grant of the  original patent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director may impose a limit on the number of post-grant  reviews   that may be instituted during each of the first four one-year periods in  which 35 U.S.C. 321 is in effect by providing notice in the Office's  Official Gazette or Federal Register. Petitions filed after an  established limit has been reached will be deemed untimely.</p>
