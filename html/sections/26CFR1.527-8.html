                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assessment and collections. Since the taxes imposed by section  527 are taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Code, all provisions of law  and of the regulations applicable to the taxes imposed by subtitle A are  applicable to the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed by  section 527. Organizations subject to the tax imposed by section 527 are  subject to the same provisions, including penalties, as are provided for  corporations, in general, except that the requirements of section 6154  concerning the payment of estimated tax do not apply. See, generally,  sections 6151, et. seq., and the regulations prescribed thereunder, for  provisions relating to payment of tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Returns. For requirements of filing annual returns with respect  to political organization taxable income, see section 6012 (a) (6) and  the applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Taxable years, method of accounting, etc. The taxable year  (fiscal year or calendar year, as the case may be) of a political  organization is determined without regard to the fact that such  organization may have been exempt from tax during any prior period. See  sections 441 and 446, and the regulations thereunder in this part, and  section 7701 and the regulations in Part 301 of this chapter  (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). Similarly, in computing  political organization taxable income, the determination of the taxable  year for which an item of income or expense is taken into account is  made under the provisions of sections 441, 446, 451, 461, and the  regulations thereunder, whether or not the item arose during a taxable  year beginning before, on, or after the effective date of the provisions  imposing a tax upon political organization taxable income. If a method  for treating bad debts was selected in a return of income (other than an  information return) for a previous taxable year, the taxpayer must  follow such method in its returns under section 527, unless such method  is changed inaccordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.166-1. A taxpayer  who has not previously selected a method for treating bad debts may, in  its first return under section 6012 (a) (6), exercise the option granted  in Sec. 1.166-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of  Sec. 1.527-6 and in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.527-9, the regulations under  section 527 apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1974.
