                                Sec. 10.4  What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The risk for human and civil rights violations due to lack of common standards will subject the operation and/or facility to unnecessary exposure to liability. Lack of employee standards, particularly for training and background checks, will increase the risk of misconduct and vicarious liability of the tribes and the Federal government through tort claims. Funding sources for detention programs may become scarce to nonexistent because of contract noncompliance. The tribes' opportunity to receive funding from potential resource sharing agreements with other law enforcement agencies may be damaged because the facility may have to be closed for cause due to violation of the life safety codes.</p>
