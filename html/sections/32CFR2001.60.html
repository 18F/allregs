                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart sets standards for establishing and  maintaining an ongoing agency self-inspection program, which shall  include regular reviews of representative samples of the agency's  original and derivative classification actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility. The senior agency official is responsible for  directing and administering the agency's self-inspection program. The  senior agency official shall designate agency personnel to assist in  carrying out this responsibility. The program shall be structured to  provide the senior agency official with information necessary to assess  the effectiveness of the classified national security information  program within individual agency activities and the agency as a whole,  in order to enable the senior agency official to fulfill his or her  responsibility to oversee the agency's program under section 5.4(d) of  the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approach. The senior agency official shall determine the means  and methods for the conduct of self-inspections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Self-inspections should evaluate the adherence to the principles  and requirements of the Order and this directive and the effectiveness  of agency   programs covering original classification, derivative classification,  declassification, safeguarding, security violations, security education  and training, and management and oversight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regular reviews of representative samples of the agency's  original and derivative classification actions shall encompass all  agency activities that generate classified information. They shall  include a sample of varying types of classified information (in document  and electronic format such as e-mail) to provide a representative sample  of the activity's classification actions. The sample shall be  proportionally sufficient to enable a credible assessment of the  agency's classified product. Agency personnel who are assigned to  conduct reviews of agencies' original and derivative classification  actions shall be knowledgeable of the classification and marking  requirements of the Order and this directive, and have access to  pertinent security classification guides. In accordance with section  5.4(d)(4) of the Order, the senior agency official shall authorize  appropriate agency officials to correct misclassification actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Self-inspections should include a review of relevant security  directives and instructions, as well as interviews with producers and  users of classified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Frequency. Self-inspections shall be regular, ongoing, and  conducted at least annually with the senior agency official setting the  frequency on the basis of program needs and the degree of classification  activity. Activities that generate significant amounts of classified  information shall include a representative sample of their original and  derivative classification actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coverage. The senior agency official shall establish self- inspection coverage requirements based on program and policy needs.  Agencies with special access programs shall evaluate those programs in  accordance with sections 4.3(b)(2) and (4) of the Order, at least  annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting. Agencies shall document the findings of self- inspections internally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Internal. The senior agency official shall set the format for  documenting self-inspection findings. As part of corrective action for  findings and other concerns of a systemic nature, refresher security  education and training should address the underlying cause(s) of the  issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> External. The senior agency official shall report annually to  the Director of ISOO on the agency's self-inspection program. This  report shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the agency's self-inspection program to include  activities assessed, program areas covered, and methodology utilized;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The assessment and a summary of the findings of the agency  self-inspections in the following program areas: Original  classification, derivative classification, declassification,  safeguarding, security violations, security education and training, and  management and oversight;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specific information with regard to the findings of the annual  review of the agency's original and derivative classification actions to  include the volume of classified materials reviewed and the number and  type of discrepancies that were identified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Actions that have been taken or are planned to correct  identified deficiencies or misclassification actions, and to deter their  reoccurrence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Best practices that were identified during self-inspections.</p>
