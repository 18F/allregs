                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, are a semi-domesticated member of the  deer family, Cervidae. They are essentially the same animal as their  wild cousins, the caribou, but tend to be smaller than caribou. Reindeer  and caribou are different subspecies of the same family, genus, and  species. The term ``reindeer'' includes caribou that have been  introduced into animal husbandry or have joined reindeer herds, the  offspring of these caribou, and the offspring of reindeer.</p>
