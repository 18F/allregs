The monthly dollar amounts will  be determined by CMS using the formula in Sec. 1860D-13(a)(7)(B) of the  Act. Based on your tax filing status for the tax year we use to make a  determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we  will determine which table is applicable to you. We will use your  modified adjusted gross income to determine which income-related monthly  adjustment amount to apply to you. The dollar amounts used for each of  the ranges of income-related monthly adjustment will be set annually  after 2019 as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The modified  adjusted gross income ranges will be adjusted annually after 2019 as  described in Sec. 418.2115(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General table of applicable percentages.
