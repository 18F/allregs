                                Sec. 255.4  Persons from whom overpayments may be recovered.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overpaid individual. The Board may recover an overpayment from  the individual to whom the overpayment has been made by any method  permitted by this part, or by the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4  CFR chapter 2) (Example 1 of this section). If the overpaid individual  dies before recovery is completed, then recovery may be effected by  recovery from the estate or the heirs of such individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other than overpaid individual. The Board may recover an  overpayment from a person other than the overpaid individual if such  person is receiving benefits based upon the same record of compensation  as the overpaid individual under a statute administered by the Board. In  such a case, the Board will ordinarily recover the overpayment by setoff  against such benefits as are provided for in Sec. 255.6 of this part  (Example 2 of this section). However, the Board may ask for a cash  refund of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individual not in the same household. Recovery under paragraph  (b) of this section may be made from an individual who was not living in  the same household, as defined in part 216 of this chapter, as the  overpaid individual at the time of the overpayment, if the individual  from whom recovery is to be made either was aware that benefits were  being paid incorrectly or benefitted from the overpayment. (Example 3 of  this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). An employee receiving a disability annuity returns to  work without notifying the Board. The Board discovers that the employee  is working and determines that the employee has recovered from his  disability and has been overpaid. The Board requests that the employee  repay the overpayment by cash refund either in one lump sum or in  installment payments. If the employee refuses, the Board may refer the  debt to a collection agency or the Department of Justice for civil suit  or may collect the debt in any other manner permitted by law.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). The employee in Example 1 agrees to refund the  overpayment by cash installment payments. However, the employee dies  before repaying the total amount of the overpayment. At his death the  employee's widow, who was living with the employee at the time the  overpayment was incurred, becomes entitled to a widow's annuity. The  Board may recover the remainder of the overpayment from any benefits due  the widow.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). C, a child of a deceased employee by his first  marriage, is receiving a disability annuity on the employee's record of  compensation. W, the employee's second wife, is receiving a widow's  annuity on the   employee's record of compensation. C lives with his mother, the  employee's first wife. C marries without notifying the Board. Marriage  terminates a child's annuity. W is not aware of C's marriage. Upon  discovery of C's marriage, the Board demands that C refund the overpaid  annuities; C refuses. Even though W is receiving an annuity based upon  the same record of compensation as that of C, the Board will not recover  the overpayment from W because she is not in the same household as C,  was not aware of the incorrect benefits paid, and did not benefit from  them.</p>
