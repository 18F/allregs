Extra good time and seniority are inseparable with the exception of lump sum awards for which no seniority is earned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Seniority refers to the time accrued in an extra good time earning status. Twelve months of ``seniority'' automatically cause the earning rate to increase from three days per month to five days per month and seniority is then vested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Earning status refers to the status of an inmate who is in an assignment or employment which accrues extra good time.</p>
