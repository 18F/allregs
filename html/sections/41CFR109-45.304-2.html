Sec. 109-45.304-2.50  Negotiated sales and negotiated sales at fixedprices by designated contractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Negotiated sales by designated contractors of surplus contractor inventory may be made when the DOE contracting officer determines and documents prior to the sale that the use of this method of sale is justified on the basis of the circumstances enumerated below, provided that the Government's interests are adequately protected. These sales shall be at prices which are fair and reasonable and not less than the proceeds which could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the personal property was offered for competitive sale. Specific conditions justifying negotiated sales include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No acceptable bids have been received as a result of competitive bidding under a suitable advertised sale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal property is of such small value that the proceeds to be derived would not warrant the expense of a formal competitive sale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The disposal will be to a state, territory, possession, political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the estimated fair market value of the personal property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The specialized nature and limited use potential of the personal property would create negligible bidder interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Removal of the personal property would result in a significant reduction in value, or the accrual of disproportionate expense in handling; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> It can be clearly established that such action is in the best interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When determined to be in the best interests of the Government, heads of field organizations may authorize fixed-price sales of surplus contractor inventory by designated contractors provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fair market value of the item to be sold does not exceed $15,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adequate procedures for publicizing such sales have been established;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sales prices are not less than could reasonably be expected if competitive bid sales methods were employed and the prices have been approved by a reviewing authority designated by the head of the field organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The warranty prescribed in Sec. 109-45.302-50(a) of this subpart is obtained when sales are made to employees.</p>
