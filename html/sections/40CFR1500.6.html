                            <p class="depth0">Each agency shall interpret the provisions of the Act as a  supplement to its existing authority and as a mandate to view  traditional policies and missions in the light of the Act's national  environmental objectives. Agencies shall review their policies,  procedures, and regulations accordingly and revise them as necessary to  insure full compliance with the purposes and provisions of the Act. The  phrase ``to the fullest extent possible'' in section 102 means that each  agency of the Federal Government shall comply with that section unless  existing law applicable to the agency's operations expressly prohibits  or makes compliance impossible.</p>
