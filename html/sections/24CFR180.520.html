                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. At the hearing, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice of the taking of the deposition, in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deposition of an expert witness may be used by any party for any purpose, unless the ALJ rules that such use is unfair or in violation of due process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deposition of a party, or of anyone who at the time of the taking of the deposition was an officer, director, or duly authorized agent of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association that is a party, may be used by any other party for any purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the ALJ finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the witness is dead;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the witness is out of the United States or more than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the witness is unable to attend to testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whenever exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may require the party to introduce all of the deposition that is relevant to the part introduced. Any party may introduce any other part of the deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken. If a proceeding has been dismissed and another proceeding involving the same subject matter is later brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken in the former proceeding may be used in the latter proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objections to admissibility. Except as provided in this paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part of a deposition for any reason that would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were present and testifying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the basis of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
