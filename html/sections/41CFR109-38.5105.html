                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured  or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any  Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically  fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily  work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different  from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly,  efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of  measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and  evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and  documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The  objectives should take into consideration past performance, future  requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate,  but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager.  The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment  Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all  proposed local use objectives.</p>
