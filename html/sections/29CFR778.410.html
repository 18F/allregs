                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The statute provides that the guaranty must be a weekly  guaranty. A guaranty of monthly, semimonthly, or biweekly pay (which  would allow averaging wages over more than one workweek) does not  qualify under this paragraph. Obviously guarantees for periods less than  a workweek do not qualify. Whatever sum is guaranteed must be paid in  full in all workweeks, however short in which the employee performs any  amount of work for the employer. The amount of the guaranty may not be  subject to proration or deduction in short weeks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contract must provide a guaranty of pay. The amount must be  specified. A mere guaranty to provide work for a particular number of  hours does not qualify under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The pay guaranteed must be ``for not more than 60 hours based on  the rate so specified.''</p>
