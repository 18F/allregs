                            <p class="depth0">After a hearing is requested but before it is held, an attorney advisor may conduct prehearing proceedings as set out in Sec. 404.942(c) or Sec. 416.1442(c) of this chapter. If, after the completion of these proceedings, we can make a decision that is fully favorable to you and all other parties based on the preponderance of the evidence, an attorney advisor, instead of an administrative law judge, may issue the decision. We use the procedures Sec. 404.942 or Sec. 416.1442 of this chapter when we conduct prehearing proceedings or issue decisions under this section.
