                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. To establish procedures to determine whether to grant  permission to use or imitate the seal, emblem, names, or initials of the  Marine Corps in connection with commercial and certain noncommercial  activities pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 7881. The Secretary of the Navy, in  Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.7, has provided the policy and  delegated to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), power to  subdelegate to certain subordinate officers in writing, the authority to  grant permission required by section 7881(b) of 10 U.S.C. for such use  or imitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The provisions of this Order requiring prior approval of  the Secretary of the Navy, CMC, or the designee apply only to the use or  imitation of the seal, emblem, names, or initials of the Marine Corps  that suggest official approval, endorsement, or authorization is in  connection with a promotion, goods, services, or commercial activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No unofficial use or imitation of the Marine  Corps seal. Reproduction and use of the Marine Corps seal, as designated  in Executive Order No. 10538 of June 22, 1954, is restricted to  materials emanating from Headquarters Marine Corps. Except for  manufacture of official letterhead stationery and related items of  official Marine Corps use, reproduction and use of the Marine Corps seal  is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unofficial use or imitation of the Marine Corps emblem, names,  or initials. Requests from civilian enterprises to use or imitate the  Marine Corps emblem, names, or initials will ordinarily be approved  where use or imitation merely provides a Marine Corps accent or flavor  to otherwise fungible goods. Disapproval, however, usually may be   expected where such use or imitation reasonably would:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Imply any official or unofficial connection between the Marine  Corps and the user;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tend to create the impression that the Marine Corps or the  United States is in any way responsible for any financial or legal  obligation of the user;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Give the impression that the Marine Corps selectively benefits  the particular manufacturer, commercial entity, or other user, as in  displaying the Marine Corps emblem, names, or initials on musical  instruments, weapons, or the like, and in using the emblem, names, or  initials in connection with advertising, naming, or describing products  and services such as insurance, real estate, or financial services; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tend to subject the Marine Corps to discredit or would be  inimical to the health, safety, welfare, or morale of the members of the  Marine Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceptable use of imitation of the Marine Corps insignia. No  request for permission is required when a use or imitation of the Marine  Corps emblem, names, or initials includes prominent display of the  disclaimer, ``Neither the United States Marine Corps nor any other  component of the Department of Defense has approved, endorsed, or  authorized this product (or promotion, or service, or activity)'' as an  integral part of the use of imitation. A ``prominent display'' is one  located on the same page as the first use of the insignia, prominent in  that use, and printed in letters at least one half the size and density  of the insignia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When permission required. Commercial or  noncommercial use or imitation of the Marine Corps emblem, names, or  initials is prohibited unless permission is first obtained in writing  from the CMC, except when such use does not suggest that the use or  imitation is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Marine Corps or  any other component of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Redelegation of authority. The CMC hereby redelegates, pursuant  to the authorization in paragraph 4 of the Secretary of the Navy 5030.7,  authority to grant written permission to use the Marine Corps emblem,  names, or initials to the Director, Administration Resource Management  (ARDE). Prior to granting approval for commercial usage of the Marine  Corps insignia, the CMC (ARDE) shall forward such requests to the Head,  Marine Corps Exchange Service Branch, Facilities and Services Division,  Installations and Logistics Department (CMC) (LFE)) and to the Counsel  for the Commandant (CMC (CL)) for comment and concurrence. All other  requests shall be routed to the Director, Judge Advocate Division (CMC  (JAR)) for comment and concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for obtaining written permission. Requests for  written permission to use or imitate the Marine Corps emblem, names, or  initials shall be in writing and shall be directed to the CMC (ARDE).  The request should, at a minimum, contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the requester.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the type of activity in which the requester is  engaged or proposes to engage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement of whether the requester considers the proposed  use or imitation to be commercial or noncommercial, and why.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A brief description and illustration or sample of the proposed  use or imitation, as well as a description of the product or service in  connection with which it will be used. This description will provide  sufficient detail to enable the Marine Corps to determine whether there  is a reasonable tendency to suggest such use or imitation is approved,  endorsed, or authorized by the Marine Corps or any other component of  the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a noncommercial use of imitation, a copy of the  charter, constitution, bylaws, and similar organizational documents of  the requester, together with a detailed description of its function or  purpose. Insufficiently specific requests will be returned for  additional information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reserve applicability. This Order is applicable to the Marine  Corps Reserve.  [51 FR 45467, Dec. 19, 1986, as amended at 65 FR 62619, Oct. 19, 2000]</p>
