Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union, Local 6, 391  U.S. 492 at 504. The Court stated that the union, in applying such a  rule, ``* * * assumes that rank and file union members are unable to  distinguish qualified from unqualified candidates for particular offices  without a demonstration of a candidate's performance in other offices.  But Congress' model of democratic elections was political elections in  this Country, and they are not based on any such assumption. Rather, in  those elections the assumption is that voters will exercise common sense  and judgment in casting their ballots. Local 6 made no showing that  citizens assumed to make discriminating judgments in public elections  cannot be relied on to make such judgments when, voting as union members  * * *.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
