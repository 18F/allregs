                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Arbitration-program-eligible matters. Matters eligible for  arbitration under the Board's program are: Demurrage; accessorial  charges; misrouting or mishandling of rail cars; and disputes involving  a carrier's published rules and practices as applied to particular rail  transportation. Parties may agree in writing to arbitrate additional  matters on a case-by-case basis as provided in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monetary award cap. Arbitration claims may not exceed the  arbitration program award cap of $200,000 per arbitral proceeding  unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The defending party's opt-in notice provides for a different  monetary cap or;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties agree to select a different award cap that will  govern their arbitration proceeding. The parties may change the award  cap by incorporating an appropriate provision in their agreement to  arbitrate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Counterclaims will not offset against the monetary award cap of  the initiating claim. A counterclaim is an independent claim and is  subject to a monetary award cap of $200,000 per case, separate from the  initiating claim, or to a different cap agreed upon by the parties in  accordance with Sec.  1108.4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assignment of arbitration-program-eligible matters. The Board  shall assign to arbitration all arbitration-program-eligible disputes  arising in a docketed proceeding where all parties to the proceeding are  participants in the Board's arbitration program, or where one or more  parties to the matter are participants in the Board's arbitration  program, and all other parties to the proceeding request or consent to  arbitration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Matters partially arbitration-program-eligible. Where the issues  in a proceeding before the Board relate in part to arbitration-program- eligible matters, only those parts of the dispute related to  arbitration-program-eligible matters may be arbitrated pursuant to the  arbitration program, unless the   parties petition the Board in accordance with paragraph (e) of this  section to include additional disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other matters. Parties may petition the Board, on a case-by-case  basis, to assign to arbitration disputes, or portions of disputes, not  listed as arbitration-program-eligible matters. This may include  counterclaims and affirmative defenses. The Board will not consider for  arbitration types of disputes which are expressly prohibited in Sec.   1108.2(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Arbitration clauses. Nothing in the Board's regulations shall  preempt the applicability of, or otherwise supersede, any new or  existing arbitration clauses contained in agreements between shippers  and carriers.</p>
