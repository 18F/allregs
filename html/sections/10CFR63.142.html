                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction and Applicability. DOE is required by Sec.  63.21(c)(20) to include in   its safety analysis report a description of the quality assurance  program to be applied to all structures, systems, and components  important to safety, to design and characterization of barriers  important to waste isolation, and to related activities. These  activities include: site characterization; acquisition, control, and  analyses of samples and data; tests and experiments; scientific studies;  facility and equipment design and construction; facility operation;  performance confirmation; permanent closure; and decontamination and  dismantling of surface facilities. The description must indicate how the  applicable quality assurance requirements will be satisfied. DOE shall  include information pertaining to the managerial and administrative  controls to be used to ensure safe operation in its safety analysis  report. High-level waste repositories include structures, systems, and  components that prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated event  sequences or that are important to waste isolation capabilities that  could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public. The  pertinent requirements of this subpart apply to all activities that are  important to waste isolation and important to safety functions of those  structures, systems, and components. These activities include designing,  purchasing, fabricating, handling, shipping, storing, cleaning,  erecting, installing, inspecting, testing, operating, maintaining,  repairing, modifying, site characterization, performance confirmation,  permanent closure, decontamination, and dismantling of surface  facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organization. DOE shall establish and execute a quality  assurance program. DOE may delegate to others, such as contractors,  agents, or consultants, the work of establishing and executing the  quality assurance program, or any part of it, but DOE retains  responsibility for it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authority and duties of persons and organizations performing  activities affecting the functions of structures, systems, and  components that are important to waste isolation and important to safety  must be clearly established and delineated in writing. These activities  include both the performing functions of attaining quality objectives  and the quality assurance functions. The quality assurance functions are  those of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assuring that an appropriate quality assurance program is  established and effectively executed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Verifying that activities important to waste isolation and  important to safety functions have been correctly performed by checking,  auditing, and inspection of structures, systems, and components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The persons and organizations performing quality assurance  functions shall have sufficient authority and organizational freedom to  identify quality problems; to initiate, recommend, or provide solutions;  and to verify implementation of solutions. The persons and organizations  performing quality assurance functions shall report to a management  level so that the required authority and organizational freedom,  including sufficient independence from cost and schedule when opposed to  safety considerations, are provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Because of the many variables involved, such as the number of  personnel, the type of activity being performed, and the location or  locations where activities are performed, the organizational structure  for executing the quality assurance program may take various forms  provided that the persons and organizations assigned the quality  assurance functions have this required authority and organizational  freedom. Irrespective of the organizational structure, the individual(s)  assigned the responsibility for assuring effective execution of any  portion of the quality assurance program at any location where  activities subject to 10 CFR part 63 are being performed must have  direct access to the levels of management as may be necessary to perform  this function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Quality assurance program. DOE shall establish a quality  assurance program that complies with the requirements of this subpart at  the earliest practicable time, consistent with the schedule for  accomplishing the activities. This program must be documented by written  policies, procedures, or instructions and must be carried out throughout  facility life in accordance   with those policies, procedures, or instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE shall identify the structures, systems, and components to be  covered by the quality assurance program and the major organizations  participating in the program, together with the designated functions of  these organizations. The quality assurance program must control  activities affecting the quality of the identified structures, systems,  and components, to an extent consistent with their importance to safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities affecting quality must be accomplished under suitably  controlled conditions. Controlled conditions include the use of  appropriate equipment; suitable environmental conditions for  accomplishing the activity, such as adequate cleanness; and assurance  that all prerequisites for the given activity have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The program must take into account the need for special  controls, processes, test equipment, tools, and skills to attain the  required quality, and the need for verification of quality by inspection  and test. The program must provide for indoctrination and training of  personnel performing activities affecting quality as necessary to assure  that suitable proficiency is achieved and maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DOE shall regularly review the status and adequacy of the  quality assurance program. Management of other organizations  participating in the quality assurance program shall regularly review  the status and adequacy of that part of the quality assurance program  which they are executing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Design control. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE shall establish measures to assure that  applicable regulatory requirements and the design basis, as defined in  Sec. 63.2 and as specified in the license application, for those  structures, systems, and components to which this subpart applies, are  correctly translated into specifications, drawings, procedures, and  instructions. These measures must assure that appropriate quality  standards are specified and included in design documents and that  deviations from such standards are controlled. Measures must also be  established for the selection and review for suitability of application  of materials, parts, equipment, and processes that are important to  waste isolation and important to safety functions of the structures,  systems and components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE shall establish measures to identify and control design  interfaces and for coordination among participating design  organizations. These measures must include the establishment of  procedures among participating design organizations for the review,  approval, release, distribution, and revision of documents involving  design interfaces.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The design control measures must provide for verifying or  checking the adequacy of design, such as by the performance of design  reviews, by the use of alternate or simplified calculational methods, or  by the performance of a suitable testing program. The verifying or  checking process must be performed by individuals or groups other than  those who performed the original design. These individuals may be from  the same organization. If a test program is used to verify the adequacy  of a specific design feature in lieu of other verifying or checking  processes, it must include suitable qualifications testing of a  prototype unit under the most adverse design conditions. Design control  measures must be applied to items such as: criticality physics, stress,  thermal, hydraulic, and preclosure and postclosure analyses;  compatibility of materials; accessibility for inservice inspection,  maintenance and repair; and delineation of acceptance criteria for  inspections and tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Design changes, including field changes, must be subject to  design control measures commensurate with those applied to the original  design and be approved by the organization that performed the original  design unless the applicant designates another responsible organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procurement document control. DOE shall establish measures to  assure that applicable regulatory requirements, design bases, and other  requirements necessary to assure adequate quality are suitably included  or referenced in the documents for procurement of material, equipment,  and services, whether purchased by the licensee or applicant or by its  contractors or subcontractors.   To the extent necessary, procurement documents must require contractors  or subcontractors to provide a quality assurance program consistent with  the pertinent provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Instructions, procedures, and drawings. Activities affecting  quality must be prescribed by documented instructions, procedures, or  drawings of a type appropriate to the circumstances and must be  accomplished in accordance with these instructions, procedures, or  drawings. Instructions, procedures, or drawings must include appropriate  quantitative or qualitative acceptance criteria for determining that  important activities have been satisfactorily accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Document control. DOE shall establish measures to control the  issuance of documents, such as instructions, procedures, and drawings,  including changes to them that prescribe all activities affecting  quality. These measures must assure that documents, including changes,  are reviewed for adequacy and approved for release by authorized  personnel and are distributed to and used at the location where the  prescribed activity is performed. Changes to documents must be reviewed  and approved by the same organizations that performed the original  review and approval unless the applicant designates another responsible  organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Control of purchased material, equipment, and services. DOE  shall establish measures to assure that purchased material, equipment,  and services, whether purchased directly or through contractors and  subcontractors, conform to the procurement documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> These measures must include appropriate provisions for source  evaluation and selection, objective evidence of quality furnished by the  contractor or subcontractor, inspection at the contractor or  subcontractor source, and examination of products upon delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentary evidence that material and equipment conform to the  procurement requirements must be available at the high-level waste  repository site before the material and equipment are installed or used.  This documentary evidence must be retained at the high-level waste  repository site and be sufficient to identify the specific requirements,  such as codes, standards, or specifications, met by the purchased  material and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The effectiveness of the control of quality by contractors and  subcontractors must be assessed by the licensee or applicant or designee  at intervals consistent with the importance, complexity, and quantity of  the product or services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification and control of materials, parts, and components.  Measures must be established for the identification and control of  materials, parts, and components, including partially fabricated  assemblies. These measures must assure that identification of the item  is maintained by heat number, part number, serial number, or other  appropriate means, either on the item or on records traceable to the  item, as required throughout fabrication, erection, installation, and  use of the item. These identification and control measures must be  designed to prevent the use of incorrect or defective material, parts,  and components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Control of special processes. DOE shall establish measures to  assure that special processes, including welding, heat treating, and  nondestructive testing, are controlled and accomplished by qualified  personnel using qualified procedures in accordance with applicable  codes, standards, specifications, criteria, and other special  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Inspection. DOE shall establish and execute a program for  inspection of activities affecting quality to verify conformance with  the documented instructions, procedures, and drawings for accomplishing  the activity. The inspection must be performed by individuals other than  those who performed the activity being inspected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examinations, measurements, or tests of material or products  processed must be performed for each work operation where necessary to  assure quality. If inspection of processed material or products is  impossible or disadvantageous, indirect control by monitoring processing  methods, equipment, and personnel must be provided. Both inspection and  process monitoring   must be provided when control is inadequate without both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If mandatory inspection hold points that require witnessing or  inspecting by the applicant's designated representative and beyond which  work may not proceed without the consent of its designated  representative are required, the specific hold points must be indicated  in appropriate documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Test control. DOE shall establish a test program to assure that  all testing required to demonstrate that structures, systems, and  components important to safety will perform satisfactorily in service is  identified and performed in accordance with written test procedures  which incorporate the requirements and acceptance limits contained in  applicable design documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test program must include, as appropriate, proof tests prior  to installation, preoperational tests, and operational tests during  repository operation, of structures, systems, and components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test procedures must include provisions for assuring that all  prerequisites for the given test have been met, that adequate test  instrumentation is available and used, and that the test is performed  under suitable environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test results must be documented and evaluated to assure that  test requirements have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Control of measuring and test equipment. DOE shall establish  measures to assure that tools, gages, instruments, and other measuring  and testing devices used in activities affecting quality are properly  controlled, calibrated, and adjusted at specified periods to maintain  accuracy within necessary limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Handling, storage, and shipping. DOE shall establish measures to  control the handling, storage, shipping, cleaning and preservation of  material and equipment in accordance with work and inspection  instructions to prevent damage or deterioration. When necessary for  particular products, special protective environments, such as inert gas  atmosphere, specific moisture content levels, and temperature levels,  must be specified and provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Inspection, test, and operating status. DOE shall establish  measures to indicate the status of inspections and tests performed on  individual items of the high-level waste repository by markings such as  stamps, tags, labels, routing cards, or other suitable means. These  measures must provide for the identification of items that have  satisfactorily passed required inspections and tests, where necessary to  preclude inadvertent bypassing of such inspections and tests. Measures  must also be established for indicating the operating status of  structures, systems, and components of the high-level waste repository,  such as by tagging valves and switches, to prevent inadvertent  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Nonconforming materials, parts, or components. DOE shall  establish measures to control materials, parts, or components which do  not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent use or  installation. These measures must include, as appropriate, procedures  for identification, documentation, segregation, disposition, and  notification to affected organizations. Nonconforming items must be  reviewed and accepted, rejected, repaired or reworked in accordance with  documented procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Corrective action. DOE shall establish measures to assure that  conditions adverse to quality, such as failures, malfunctions,  deficiencies, deviations, defective material and equipment, and  nonconformances are promptly identified and corrected. If significant  conditions are adverse to quality, the measures must assure that the  cause of the condition is determined and corrective action taken to  preclude repetition. The identification of the significant condition  adverse to quality, the cause of the condition, and the corrective  action taken must be documented and reported to appropriate levels of  management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Quality assurance records. DOE shall maintain sufficient records  to furnish evidence of activities affecting quality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The records must include at least the following: Operating logs  and the results of reviews, inspections, tests, audits, monitoring of  work performance, and materials analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The records must also include closely-related data such as  qualifications of personnel, procedures, and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection and test records must, at a minimum, identify the  inspector or data recorder, the type of observation, the results, the  acceptability, and the action taken in connection with any deficiencies  noted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records must be identifiable and retrievable. Consistent with  applicable regulatory requirements, the applicant shall establish  requirements concerning record retention, such as duration, location,  and assigned responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Audits. DOE shall carry out a comprehensive system of planned  and periodic audits to verify compliance with all aspects of the quality  assurance program and to determine the effectiveness of the program. The  audits must be performed in accordance with the written procedures or  check lists by appropriately trained personnel not having direct  responsibilities in the areas being audited. Audit results must be  documented and reviewed by management having responsibility in the area  audited. Followup action, including reaudit of deficient areas, must be  taken where indicated.</p>
