When steam or water is used to clean the primary enclosure,  whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, dogs and cats must be  removed, unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals  would not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process. Standing  water must be removed from the primary enclosure and animals in other  primary enclosures must be protected from being contaminated with water  and other wastes during the cleaning. The pans under primary enclosures  with grill-type floors and the ground areas under raised runs with mesh  or slatted floors must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent  accumulation of feces and food waste and to reduce disease hazards  pests, insects and odors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water  receptacles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles  must be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with this section before  they can be used to house, feed, or water another dog or cat, or social  grouping of dogs or cats.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs  and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the  methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often  if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,  excreta, and other disease hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hard surfaces of primary enclosures and food and water  receptacles must be sanitized using one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Live steam under pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Washing with hot water (at least 180 [deg]F (82.2 [deg]C)) and  soap or detergent, as with a mechanical cage washer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent  solutions and disinfectants, or by using a combination detergent/ disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose, with a thorough  cleaning of the surfaces to remove organic material, so as to remove all  organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide sanitization  followed by a clean water rinse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot  be sanitized using the methods provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, such as gravel, sand, grass, earth, or absorbent bedding, must  be sanitized by removing the contaminated material as necessary to  prevent odors, diseases, pests, insects, and vermin infestation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Housekeeping for premises. Premises where housing facilities are  located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean  and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the  husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate  breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.  Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste  products, and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be  controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest  control, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pest control. An effective program for the control of insects,  external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that  are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the  health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests  in animal areas.
