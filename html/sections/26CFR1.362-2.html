including any properties as to which a deduction for amortization is allowable),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Property with respect to which a deduction for amortization is allowable,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Property with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 but not under section 613, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other remaining properties.
The reduction of the basis of each of the properties within each of the above categories shall be made in proportion to the relative bases of such properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may, however, have the basis of the various units of property within a particular category adjusted in a manner different from the general rule set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

A request for variations from the general rule should be filed by the taxpayer with its return for the taxable year for which the transfer of the property has occurred.</p>
