                                Sec. 1.1441-8  Exemption from withholding for payments to foreign of issue, and the Bank for International Settlements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Foreign governments. Under section 892, certain specific types  of income received by foreign governments are excluded from gross income  and are exempt from taxation, unless derived from the conduct of a  commercial activity or received from or by a controlled commercial  entity. Accordingly, withholding is not required under Sec. 1.1441.1  with regard to any item of income which is exempt from taxation under  section 892.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> is valid only if, in addition to  other applicable requirements, it certifies that the income is, or will  be, exempt from taxation under section 892 and the regulations under  that section and whether the person whose name is on the certificate is  an integral part of a foreign government (as defined in Sec. 1.892- 2T(a)(2)) or a controlled entity (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T(a)(3)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> is valid only if, in  addition to other applicable requirements, it certifies that the person  whose name is on the certificate is a foreign central bank of issue, or  the Bank for International Settlements, and that the bank does not, and  will not, hold the obligations or the bank deposits covered by the Form  W-8 for, or use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial  banking function or other commercial activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(C)</em> and 881(d) and Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4). With respect to bankers'  acceptances, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a foreign central  bank of issue without requiring a withholding certificate if the name of  the payee and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate  that the payee or beneficial owner is a foreign central bank of issue,  as defined in Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemption for payments to international organizations. A payment  to an international organization (within the meaning of section  7701(a)(18)) is exempt from withholding on any payment. A withholding  agent may treat a payee as an international organization without  requiring a withholding certificate if the name of the payee is one that  is designated as an international organization by executive order  (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)) and   other facts surrounding the transaction reasonably indicate that the  international organization is the beneficial owner of the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(4)</em> shall apply to  withholding certificates and other documents related thereto furnished  under the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to payments  made after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> with respect  to one or more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in  effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1,  1999) and, therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to  the requirements described in this section (new withholding  certificates). For purposes of this section, a new withholding  certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation requirement under the  regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1,  revised April 1, 1999). Further, a new withholding certificate remains  valid for the period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless of  when the certificate is obtained.
