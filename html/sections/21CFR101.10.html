                            <p class="depth0">Nutrition labeling in accordance with Sec. 101.9 shall be provided  upon request for any restaurant food or meal for which a nutrient  content claim (as defined in Sec. 101.13 or in subpart D of this part)  or a health claim (as defined in Sec. 101.14 and permitted by a  regulation in subpart E of this part) is made, except that information  on the nutrient amounts that are the basis for the claim (e.g., ``low  fat, this meal provides less than 10 grams of fat'') may serve as the  functional equivalent of complete nutrition information as described in  Sec. 101.9. For the purposes of this section, restaurant food includes  two categories of food. It includes food which is served in restaurants  or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human  consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments. It  also includes food which is processed and prepared primarily in a retail  establishment, which is ready for human consumption, which is of the  type described in the previous sentence, and which is offered for sale  to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such  establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such  establishment. For standard menu items that are offered for sale in  covered establishments (as defined in Sec. 101.11(a)), the information  in the written nutrition information required by  Sec. 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(A) will serve to meet the requirements of this  section. Nutrient levels may be determined by nutrient databases,  cookbooks, or analyses or by other reasonable bases that provide  assurance that the food or meal meets the nutrient requirements for the  claim. Presentation of nutrition labeling may be in various forms,  including those provided in Sec. 101.45 and other reasonable means.</p>
