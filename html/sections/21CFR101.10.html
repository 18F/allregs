                            <p class="depth0">Nutrition labeling in accordance with Sec. 101.9 shall be provided upon request for any restaurant food or meal for which a nutrient content claim (as defined in Sec. 101.13 or in subpart D of this part) or a health claim (as defined in Sec. 101.14 and permitted by a regulation in subpart E of this part) is made, except that information on the nutrient amounts that are the basis for the claim (e.g., ``low fat, this meal provides less than 10 grams of fat'') may serve as the functional equivalent of complete nutrition information as described in Sec. 101.9. Nutrient levels may be determined by nutrient data bases, cookbooks, or analyses or by other reasonable bases that provide assurance that the food or meal meets the nutrient requirements for the claim. Presentation of nutrition labeling may be in various forms, including those provided in Sec. 101.45 and other reasonable means.
