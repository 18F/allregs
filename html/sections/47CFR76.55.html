A qualified local NCE television station is a qualified NCE television station:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That is licensed to a community whose reference point, as defined in Sec.  76.53 is within 80.45 km (50 miles) of the principal headend, as defined in Sec.  76.5(pp), of the cable system; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whose Grade B service contour encompasses the principal headend, as defined in Sec.  76.5(pp), of the cable system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a cable operator shall not be required to add the signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station not already carried under the provision of Sec.  76.56(a)(5), where such signal would be considered a distant signal for copyright purposes unless such station agrees to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal on the cable system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Local commercial television station. A local commercial television station is any full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified NCE television station as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market, as defined below in paragraph (e) of this section, as the cable system, except that the term local commercial television station does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Low power television stations, television translator stations, and passive repeaters with operate pursuant to part 74 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under the capable compulsory copyright license, 17 U.S.C. 111, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend, as defined in Sec.  76.5(pp), of a cable system a signal level of -45dBm for analog UHF signals, -49dBm for analog VHF signals, or -61dBm for digital signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, i.e., the input to the first active component of the signal processing equipment relevant to the signal at issue, if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Qualified low power station.

(1) Until January 1, 2000, a commercial broadcast television station's market, unless amended pursuant to Sec.  76.59, shall be defined as its Area of Dominant Influence (ADI) as determined by Arbitron and published in the Arbitron 1991-1992 Television ADI Market Guide, as noted below, except that for areas outside the contiguous 48 states, the market of a station shall be defined using Nielsen's Designated Market Area (DMA), where applicable, as published in the Nielsen 1991-92 DMA Market and Demographic Rank Report, and that Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam will each be considered a single market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective January 1, 2000, a commercial broadcast television station's market, unless amended pursuant to Sec.  76.59, shall be defined as its Designated Market Area (DMA) as determined by Nielsen Media Research and published in its Nielsen Station Index Directory and Nielsen Station Index US Television Household Estimates or any successor publications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the 1999 election pursuant to Sec.  76.64(f), which becomes effective on January 1, 2000, DMA assignments specified in the 1997-98 Nielsen Station Index Directory and September 1997 Nielsen Station Index US Television Household Estimates, available from Nielsen Media Research, 770 Broadway, New York, NY, shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable DMA list for the 2002 election pursuant to Sec.  76.64(f) will be the DMA assignments specified in the 2000-2001 list, and so forth for each triennial election pursuant to Sec.  76.64(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In addition, the county in which a station's community of license is located will be considered within its market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A cable system's television market(s) shall be the one or more ADI markets in which the communities it serves are located until January 1, 2000, and the one or more DMA markets in which the communities it serves are located thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In the absence of any mandatory carriage complaint or market modification petition, cable operators in communities that shift from one market to another, due to the change in 1999-2000 from ADI to DMA, will be permitted to treat their systems as either in the new DMA market, or with respect to the specific stations carried prior to the market change from ADI to DMA, as in both the old ADI market and the new DMA market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the change from the ADI market definition to the DMA market definition in 1999-2000 results in the filing of a mandatory carriage complaint, any affected party may respond to that

complaint by filing a market modification request pursuant to Sec.  76.59, and these two actions may be jointly decided by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (e): For the 1996 must-carry/retransimission consent election, the ADI assignments specified in the 1991-1992 Television ADI Market Guide, available from the Arbitron Ratings Co., 9705 Patuxent Woods Drive, Columbia, MD, will apply.
