                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to garbage generated onboard  any means of conveyance during international or interstate movements as  provided in this section and includes food scraps, table refuse, galley  refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, and other waste material  from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters,  dining rooms, or any other areas on the means of conveyance. This  section also applies to meals and other food that were available for  consumption by passengers and crew on an aircraft but were not consumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not all garbage generated onboard a means of conveyance is  regulated for the purposes of this section. Garbage regulated for the  purposes of this section is defined as ``regulated garbage'' in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Garbage that is commingled with regulated garbage is also  regulated garbage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Garbage regulated because of movements outside the United States  or Canada. For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a  means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if, when the garbage is on or  removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has been  in any port outside the United States and Canada within the previous 2- year period. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These  exceptions are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is  exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the  following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the  aircraft:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aircraft had previously been cleared of all garbage and of  all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except  meats that are   shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from countries  designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth disease  exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the items  previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph  have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of  regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i)  of this section were removed, the aircraft has not been in a non- Canadian foreign port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed in the  United States from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is  exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the  following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the  means of conveyance:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an  inspector stating the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That the means of conveyance had previously been cleared of all  garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of  origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk  and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which  foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all  eggs; and the items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as  prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the  procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in  paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That the means of conveyance had then been cleaned and  disinfected in the presence of the inspector; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Since being cleaned and disinfected, the means of conveyance  has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Garbage regulated because of certain movements to or from  Hawaii, territories, or possessions. For purposes of this section,  garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage,  if at the time the garbage is on or removed from the means of  conveyance, the means of conveyance has moved during the previous 1-year  period, either directly or indirectly, to the continental United States  from any territory or possession or from Hawaii, to any territory or  possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii, or to  Hawaii from any territory or possession. There are, however, two  exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is  exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the  following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from  the aircraft:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aircraft had been previously cleared of all garbage and all  fresh fruits and vegetables, and the items previously cleared from the  aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according  to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in  paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i)  of this section were removed, the aircraft has not moved to the  continental United States from any territory or possession or from  Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or  possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or  possession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed from a  means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements  under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are  met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an  inspector stating that the means of conveyance had been cleared of all  garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables; and the items previously  cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph  have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of  regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After being cleared of the garbage and stores referred to in  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the means of conveyance has not  moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession  or from Hawaii; to   any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or  from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Restrictions on regulated garbage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regulated garbage may not  be disposed of, placed on, or removed from a means of conveyance except  in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulated garbage is subject to general surveillance for  compliance with this section by inspectors and to disposal measures  authorized by the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection  Act to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests and diseases  of plants and livestock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All regulated garbage must be contained in tight, covered, leak- proof receptacles during storage on board a means of conveyance while in  the territorial waters, or while otherwise within the territory of the  United States. All such receptacles shall be contained inside the guard  rail if on a watercraft. Such regulated garbage shall not be unloaded  from such means of conveyance in the United States unless such regulated  garbage is removed in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles under the  direction of an inspector to an approved facility for incineration,  sterilization, or grinding into an approved sewage system, under direct  supervision by such an inspector, or such regulated garbage is removed  for other handling in such manner and under such supervision as may,  upon request in specific cases, be approved by the Administrator as  adequate to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests  and animal diseases and sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable  laws for environmental protection. Provided that, a cruise ship may  dispose of regulated garbage in landfills at Alaskan ports only, if and  only if the cruise ship does not have prohibited or restricted meat or  animal products on board at the time it enters Alaskan waters for the  cruise season, and only if the cruise ship, except for incidental travel  through international waters necessary to navigate safely between ports,  remains in Canadian and U.S. waters off the west coast of North America,  and calls only at continental U.S. and Canadian ports during the entire  cruise season.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Application for approval of a facility or sewage system may be  made in writing by the authorized representative of any carrier or by  the official having jurisdiction over the port or place of arrival of  the means of conveyance to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC  20250. The application must be endorsed by the operator of the facility  or sewage system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Approval will be granted if the Administrator determines that  the requirements set forth in this section are met. Approval may be  denied or withdrawn at any time, if the Administrator determines that  such requirements are not met, after notice of the proposed denial or  withdrawal of the approval and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity  to demonstrate or achieve compliance with such requirements, has been  afforded to the operator of the facility or sewage system and to the  applicant for approval. However, approval may also be withdrawn without  such prior procedure in any case in which the public health, interest,  or safety requires immediate action, and in such case, the operator of  the facility or sewage system and the applicant for approval shall  promptly thereafter be given notice of the withdrawal and the reasons  therefor and an opportunity to show cause why the approval should be  reinstated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and Veterinary  Services, Animal, and Plant Health Inspection Service, will cooperate  with other Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for enforcing  other statutes and regulations governing disposal of the regulated  garbage to the end that such disposal shall be adequate to prevent the  dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases and  comply with applicable laws for environmental protection. The  inspectors, in maintaining surveillance over regulated garbage movements  and disposal, shall coordinate their activities with the activities of  representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and   other Federal, State, and local agencies also having jurisdiction over  such regulated garbage</p>
