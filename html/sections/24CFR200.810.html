                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) The requirements of this section apply to any one-to four-family dwelling which was constructed before 1978 and is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 203(b) or other sections of the National Housing Act relating to the insurance or coinsurance of mortgages on one-to-four-family dwellings. Such other sections include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of this section apply to any one-to four-family dwelling which was constructed before 1978 and is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 203(b) or other sections of the National Housing Act relating to the insurance or coinsurance of mortgages on one-to-four-family dwellings. Such other sections include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 244 (coinsurance);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 213 (cooperative housing insurance);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 220 (rehabilitation and neighborhood conservation housing insurance);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Section 221 (housing for moderate income and displaced families);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Section 222 (mortgagor insurance for servicemen);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Section 809 (armed services housing for civilian employees);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Section 810 (armed services housing in impacted areas);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Section 234 (mortgage insurance for condominiums);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Section 235 (mortgage assistance payments for home ownership and project rehabilitation);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Section 237 (special mortgage insurance for low and moderate income families); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Section 240 (mortgage insurance on loans for purchase of fee simple title from lessors).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications for insurance in connection with a refinancing transaction where an appraisal is not required under the applicable procedures established by the Commissioner are excluded from the coverage of this section. Any housing assisted under the programs set out in this section for which no new activity is applied for or required is not covered by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appraisal. The appraiser shall, when appraising a dwelling constructed prior to 1978, inspect the dwelling for defective paint surfaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of defective paint surfaces. For defective paint surfaces, treatment shall be provided to defective areas. Treatment of hazards shall consist of covering or removing defective paint surfaces. Covering may be accomplished by such means as adding a layer of wallboard to the wall surface. Depending on the wall condition, wallcoverings which are permanently attached may be used. Covering or replacing trim surfaces is also permitted. Paint removal may be accomplished by such methods as scraping, heat treatment (infra-red or coil type heat guns) or chemicals. Machine sanding and use of propane or gasoline torches (open-flame methods) are not permitted. Washing and repainting without thorough removal or covering does not constitute adequate treatment. In the case of defective paint spots, scraping and repainting the defective area is considered adequate treatment. Treatment of a defective paint surface is not required if such a surface is found to not be a lead-based paint surface by a lead-based paint inspector certified pursuant to procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR part 745.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Home equity conversion mortgage insurance. The requirements of this section, as modified by the following sentence, apply to a dwelling which is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 255 of the National Housing Act (home equity conversion insurance) unless the mortgagor provides the certification described in Sec. 206.45(d) of this title. The defective paint surface may be treated after the mortgage is endorsed for insurance, provided that the defective paint surface is treated as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the repair work provisions contained in Sec. 206.47 of this title.
