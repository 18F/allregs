                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every local office shall determine whether or not applicants are MSFWs as defined at Sec.  651.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in Sec.  653.105, when an MSFW applies for JS services at a local office or is contacted by an Outreach worker, the services available through the JS shall be explained to the MSFW. In local offices which have been designated as significant MSFW bilingual offices by ETA, this explanation shall be made in Spanish, if necessary or requested during any period of substantial MSFW activity. Other local offices shall provide bilingual explanations wherever feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The local office staff member shall provide the MSFW a list of those services. The list shall be written in English and Spanish and shall specify those services which are available after completion of a full application and those services which are available after completion of a partial application. The JS staff member shall explain to each MSFW the advantages of completing a full application.
Applications shall be reviewed periodically by the local office manager or a member of his/her staff to ensure their accuracy and quality. Applications and the application-taking process shall also be reviewed during State and Federal onsite reviews by the State and Regional MSFW Monitor Advocates and/or review staff, who shall check overall accuracy and quality, and offer technical advice on corrections or improvements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the MSFW wishes to complete a full application, the staff shall provide all assistance necessary to complete the application and shall ensure that the form includes complete information. It shall include, to the extent possible, the significant history of the MSFW's prior employment, training and educational background and a statement of any desired employment and any training needs in order to permit a thorough assessment of the applicant's skills, abilities and preferences. All applicable items shall be completed according to the ETA instructions for preparation of the application card (ES-511). Additional Occupational Informational Network (O*NET) codes or keywords shall be assigned, where appropriate, based on the MSFW's work history, training, and skills, knowledges, and abilities. Secondary cards shall be completed and

separately filed when keywords are not used. In extremely small local offices where the limited applicant load and file size does not require completion of secondary cards, additional O*NET-SOC codes shall be noted on the primary application card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an MSFW wishes any JS service, and does not wish or is unable to file a full application, the interviewer shall try to obtain as much information as possible for a partial application. The interviewer shall enter the information on the partial application. The interviewer shall offer to refer the applicant to any available jobs for which the MSFW may be qualified, and any JS services permitted by the limited information available. He/she shall advise the MSFW that he/she may file a full application at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Partial applications shall be completed according to ETA instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Partial applications for MSFWs shall be filed in accordance with local office procedures for filing other partial applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To minimize the need for additional applications in other offices, States shall issue JS cards to MSFWs at the initial visit under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When automated data retrieval systems are available in the State. In this instance, JS staff shall advise the MSFW that the JS card may be presented at any other JS office in the State and that services will be provided without completion of an additional application unless the services requested require additional information for adequate service delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an MSFW is referred on an interstate or intrastate order. In this instance, when it is known to the order-holding local office (through the presentation of an JS card or otherwise) that the MSFW has completed a full application or partial application in the applicant holding office or elsewhere, an additional application shall not be taken by the order-holding office unless the MSFW requests JS services in addition to referral on the clearance order.
