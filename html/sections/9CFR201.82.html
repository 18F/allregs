                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, swine  contractor and live poultry dealer must exercise reasonable care and  promptness with respect to loading, transporting, holding, yarding,  feeding, watering, weighing, or otherwise handling livestock, or live  poultry to prevent waste of feed, shrinkage, injury, death or other  avoidable loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever live poultry is obtained under a poultry growing  arrangement and the weight of the live poultry is a factor in  calculating payment to the grower, the poultry must be transported  promptly after loading. The process of obtaining the gross weight must  commence immediately upon arrival at the processing plant, holding yard,  or other scale normally used for such purpose. The process of obtaining  the gross weight which may include, but is not limited to, fueling,  uncoupling the trailer, changing the road tractor to a yard tractor or  weighing the trailer only, must be conducted without delay;  specifically, the time period between arrival and completion of the  process of obtaining the gross weight must not exceed thirty (30)  minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Live poultry dealers must not place poultry from multiple  growers on a single live poultry transport trailer or other live poultry  transport equipment, creating what is commonly referred to as a ``split  load.''
