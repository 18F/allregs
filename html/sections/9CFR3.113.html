                            <p class="depth0">No dealer, research facility, exhibitor, or operator of an auction  sale shall offer for transportation or transport, in commerce, any  marine mammal in a primary enclosure that does not conform to the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Primary enclosures that are used to transport marine mammals  other than cetaceans and sirenians must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be constructed from materials of sufficient structural strength  to contain the marine mammals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be constructed from material that is durable, nontoxic, and  cannot be chewed and/or swallowed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be able to withstand the normal rigors of transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have interiors that are free from any protrusions or hazardous  openings that could be injurious to the marine mammals contained within;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be constructed so that no parts of the contained marine mammals  are exposed to the outside of the enclosures in any way that may cause  injury to the animals or to persons who are nearby or who handle the  enclosures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Have openings that provide access into the enclosures and are  secured with locking devices of a type that cannot be accidentally  opened;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Have such openings located in a manner that makes them easily  accessible at all times for emergency removal and potential treatment of  any live marine mammal contained within;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Have air inlets at heights that will provide cross ventilation  at all levels (particularly when the marine mammals are in a prone  position), are located on all four sides of the enclosures, and cover  not less than 20 percent of the total surface area of each side of the  enclosures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Have projecting rims or other devices placed on any ends and  sides of the enclosures that have ventilation openings so that there is  a minimum air circulation space of 7.6 centimeters (3.0 inches) between  the enclosures and any adjacent cargo or conveyance wall;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Be constructed so as to provide sufficient air circulation  space to maintain the temperature limits set forth in this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Be equipped with adequate handholds or other devices on the  exterior of the enclosures to enable them to be lifted without  unnecessary tilting and to ensure that the persons handling the  enclosures will not come in contact with any marine mammal contained  inside.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Straps, slings, harnesses, or other devices used for body  support or restraint, when transporting marine mammals such as cetaceans  and sirenians must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be designed so as not to prevent access to the marine mammals by  attendants for the purpose of administering in-transit care;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be equipped with special padding to prevent trauma or injury at  critical weight pressure points on the body of the marine mammals; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be capable of keeping the animals from thrashing about and  causing injury to themselves or their attendants, and yet be adequately  designed so as not to cause injury to the animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals must be  large enough to assure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of pinnipeds, polar bears, and sea otters, each  animal has sufficient space to turn about freely in a stance whereby all  four feet or flippers are on the floor and the animal can sit in an  upright position and lie in a natural position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of cetaceans and sirenians, each animal has  sufficient space for support of its body in slings, harnesses, or other  supporting devices, if used (as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this  section), without causing injury to such cetaceans or sirenians due to  contact with the primary transport enclosure: Provided, however, That  animals may be restricted in their movements according to professionally  accepted standards when such freedom of movement would constitute a  danger to the animals, their handlers, or other persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Marine mammals transported in the same primary enclosure must be  of the same species and maintained in compatible groups. Marine mammals  that have not reached puberty may not be transported in the same primary  enclosure with adult marine mammals other than their dams. Socially  dependent animals (e.g., sibling, dam, and other members of a family  group) must be allowed visual and olfactory contact whenever reasonable.  Female marine mammals may not be transported in the same primary  enclosure with any mature male marine mammals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals as provided  in this section must have solid bottoms to prevent leakage in shipment  and must be cleaned and sanitized in a manner prescribed in Sec. 3.107  of this subpart, if previously used. Within the primary enclosures used  to transport marine mammals, the animals will be maintained on sturdy,  rigid, solid floors with adequate drainage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals, except  where such primary enclosures are permanently affixed in the animal  cargo space of the primary conveyance, must be clearly marked on top  (when present) and on at least one side, or on all sides whenever  possible, with the words ``Live Animal'' or ``Wild Animal'' in letters  not less than 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in height, and with arrows or  other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the  container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Documents accompanying the shipment must be attached in an  easily accessible manner to the outside of a primary enclosure that is  part of such shipment or be in the possession of the shipping attendant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When a primary transport enclosure is permanently affixed within  the animal cargo space of the primary conveyance so that the front  opening is the only source of ventilation for such primary enclosure,  the front opening must open directly to the outside or to an  unobstructed aisle or passageway within the primary conveyance. Such  front ventilation opening must be at least 90 percent of the total  surface area of the front wall of the primary enclosure and covered with  bars, wire mesh, or smooth expanded metal.
