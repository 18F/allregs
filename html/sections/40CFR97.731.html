                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> if the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The monitoring system has been previously certified in  accordance with part 75 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicable quality-assurance and quality-control  requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this chapter and appendices B and D to  part 75 of this chapter are fully met for the certified monitoring  system described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The recertification provisions of this section shall apply to a  monitoring system under Sec. 97.730(a)(1) that is exempt from initial  certification requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner  or operator of a TR SO2 Group 2 unit shall comply with the  following initial certification and recertification procedures, for a  continuous monitoring system (i.e., a continuous emission monitoring  system and an excepted monitoring system under appendix D to part 75 of  this chapter) under Sec. 97.730(a)(1). The owner or operator of a unit  that qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted monitoring  methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter or that   qualifies to use an alternative monitoring system under subpart E of  part 75 of this chapter shall comply with the procedures in paragraph  (e) or (f) of this section respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (including the automated data acquisition and handling  system) successfully completes all of the initial certification testing  required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter by the applicable deadline in  Sec. 97.730(b). In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a  monitoring system to meet the requirements of this subpart in a location  where no such monitoring system was previously installed, initial  certification in accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator  makes a replacement, modification, or change in any certified continuous  emission monitoring system under Sec. 97.730(a)(1) that may  significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or  record SO2 mass emissions or heat input rate or to meet the  quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of Sec. 75.21 of  this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or  operator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with Sec.  75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator  makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling  system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack  flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify  each continuous emission monitoring system whose accuracy is potentially  affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of this  chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission monitoring system  that require recertification include: Replacement of the analyzer,  complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring  system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or  site. Any fuel flowmeter system under Sec. 97.730(a)(1) is subject to  the recertification requirements in Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section, the words  ``certification'' and ``initial certification'' are replaced by the word  ``recertification'' and the word ``certified'' is replaced by with the  word ``recertified''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification of certification. The designated representative  shall submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and the  Administrator written notice of the dates of certification testing, in  accordance with Sec. 97.733.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certification application. The designated representative shall  submit to the Administrator a certification application for each  monitoring system. A complete certification application shall include  the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provisional certification date. The provisional certification  date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with  Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring  system may be used under the TR SO2 Group 2 Trading Program  for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the Administrator  of the complete certification application for the monitoring system  under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded  by the provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the  requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid  quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional  certification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the  provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120  days of the date of receipt of the complete certification application by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certification application approval process. The Administrator  will issue a written notice of approval or   disapproval of the certification application to the owner or operator  within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification application  under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the  Administrator does not issue such a notice within such 120-day period,  each monitoring system that meets the applicable performance  requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is included in the  certification application will be deemed certified for use under the TR  SO2 Group 2 Trading Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Approval notice. If the certification application is complete  and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance  requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the Administrator will  issue a written notice of approval of the certification application  within 120 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Incomplete application notice. If the certification application  is not complete, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of  incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the designated  representative must submit the additional information required to  complete the certification application. If the designated representative  does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the specified date,  then the Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph  (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that  any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part  75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and  the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this  section is met, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of  disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of such  notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated by  the Administrator and the data measured and recorded by each uncertified  monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data  beginning with the date and hour of provisional certification (as  defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Audit decertification. The Administrator may issue a notice of  disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in accordance with  Sec. 97.732(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Procedures for loss of certification. If the Administrator  issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application under  paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or a notice of disapproval of  certification status under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section,  then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for  each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of unit operation  during the period of invalid data specified under Sec.  75.20(a)(4)(iii), Sec. 75.20(g)(7), or Sec. 75.21(e) of this chapter  and continuing until the applicable date and hour specified under Sec.  75.20(a)(5)(i) or (g)(7) of this chapter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a disapproved SO2 pollutant concentration monitor  and disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum potential  concentration of SO2 and the maximum potential flow rate, as  defined in sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a disapproved moisture monitoring system and disapproved  diluent gas monitoring system, respectively, the minimum potential  moisture percentage and either the maximum potential CO2  concentration or the minimum potential O2 concentration (as  applicable), as defined in sections 2.1.5, 2.1.3.1, and 2.1.3.2 of  appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a disapproved fuel flowmeter system, the maximum potential  fuel flow rate, as defined in section 2.4.2.1 of appendix D to part 75  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The designated representative shall submit a notification of  certification retest dates and a new certification application in  accordance with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or  other requirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as  indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30  unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of  disapproval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator of a unit qualified to use the low mass  emissions (LME) excepted methodology under   Sec. 75.19 of this chapter shall meet the applicable certification and  recertification requirements in Sec. Sec. 75.19(a)(2) and 75.20(h) of  this chapter. If the owner or operator of such a unit elects to certify  a fuel flowmeter system for heat input determination, the owner or  operator shall also meet the certification and recertification  requirements in Sec. 75.20(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> of this chapter.</p>
