The term ``life annuities'' is defined in Article X(3).  The term ``private pensions'' does not include pensions or retired pay  paid by the United States or by any State or Territory of the United  States; it does include periodic payments made in consideration for  services rendered or by way of compensation for injuries received.</p>
