Sufficient number of 6-hour area samples in each distinct work area of the plant should be collected at locations which provide representative samples of air to which the worker is exposed. In order to avoid filter overloading, sampling time may be shortened when sampling in dusty areas. Samples in each work area should be gathered simultaneously or sequentially during a normal operating period. The daily time-weighted average (TWA) exposure of each worker can then be determined by using the following formula:
Summation of hours spent in each location and the dust concentration in</p><p class="depth0">that location.</p><p class="depth0">Total hours exposed

The instrument used shall provide a tracing or display of either flow versus volume or volume versus time during the entire forced expiration. A tracing or display is necessary to determine whether the patient has performed the test properly. The tracing must be stored and available for recall and must be of sufficient size that hand measurements may be made within requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. If a paper record is made it must have a paper speed of at least 2 cm/sec and a volume sensitivity of at least 10.0 mm of chart per liter of volume.</p><p class="depth0">h. The instrument shall be capable of accumulating volume for a minimum of 10 seconds and shall not stop accumulating volume before (1) the volume change for a 0.5 second interval is less than 25 milliliters, or (2) the flow is less than 50 milliliters per second for a 0.5 second interval.</p><p class="depth0">i. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) measurements shall comply with the accuracy requirements stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

Use of a nose clip is recommended but not required. The procedures shall be explained in simple terms to the patient who shall be instructed to loosen any tight clothing and stand in front of the apparatus. The subject may sit, but care should be taken on repeat testing that the same position be used and, if possible, the same spirometer. Particular attention shall be given to insure that the chin is slightly elevated with the neck slightly extended. The patient shall be instructed to make a full inspiration from a normal breathing pattern and then blow into the apparatus, without interruption, as hard, fast, and completely as possible. At least three forced expirations shall be carried out. During the maneuvers, the patient shall be observed for compliance with instruction. The expirations shall be checked visually for reproducibility from flow-volume or volume-time tracings or displays. The following efforts shall be judged unacceptable when the patient:</p><p class="depth0">1. Has not reached full inspiration preceding the forced expiration,</p><p class="depth0">2. Has not used maximal effort during the entire forced expiration,</p><p class="depth0">3.

Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest FVC's and FEV1's of the three satisfactory tracings should not exceed 10 percent or 100 milliliters, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0">b. Periodic and routine recalibration of the instrument or method for recording FVC and FEV1.0 should be performed using a syringe or other volume source of at least 2 liters.</p><p class="depth0">iii. interpretation of spirogram</p><p class="depth0">a. The first step in evaluating a spirogram should be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in II above. From the three satisfactory tracings, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) shall be measured and recorded. The largest observed FVC and largest observed FEV1 shall be used in the analysis regardless of the curve(s) on which they occur.</p><p class="depth0">b. The following guidelines are recommended by NIOSH for the evaluation and management of workers exposed to cotton dust. It is important to note that employees who show reductions in FEV1/FVC ratio below .75 or drops in Monday FEV1 of 5 percent or greater on their initial screening exam, should be re-evaluated within a month of the first exam. Those who show consistent decrease in lung function, as shown on the following table, should be managed as recommended.</p><p class="depth0">iv. qualifications of personnel administering the test</p><p class="depth0">Technicians who perform pulmonary function testing should have the basic knowledge required to produce meaningful results.

Samples to be taken--In order to ascertain equivalency, it is necessary to collect a total of 100 samples from at least 10 sites in a mill. That is, there should be 10 replicate readings at each of 10 sites. The sites should represent dust levels which vary over the allowable range of 0.5 to 2 times the permissible exposure limit. Each sample requires the use of two vertical elutriators (VE's) and at least one but not more than two alternative devices (AD's). Thus, the end result is 200 VE readings and either 100 or 200 AD readings. The 2 VE readings and the 1 or 2 AD readings at each time and site must be made simultaneously. That is, the two VE's and one or two AD's must be arranged together in such a way that they are measuring essentially the same dust levels.</p><p class="depth0">b. Data averaging--The two VE readings taken at each site are then averaged. These averages are to be used as the 100 VE readings. If two alternate devices were used, their test results are also averaged. Thus, after this step is accomplished, there will be 100 VE readings and 100 AD readings.</p><p class="depth0">c. Differences--For each of the 100 sets of measurements (VE and AD) the difference is obtained as the average VE reading minus the AD reading. Call these differences Di. Thus, we have.

Equivalency test. The next step is to obtain the average of the 100 VE readings.

Airborne. 1 part DBCP vapor per billion parts of air (1 ppb); time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour workday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Dermal. Eye contact and skin contact with DBCP are prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">C. Appearance and odor: Technical grade DBCP is a dense yellow or amber liquid with a pungent odor. It may also appear in granular form, or blended in varying concentrations with other liquids.</p><p class="depth0">D. Uses: DBCP is used to control nematodes, very small worm-like plant parasites, on crops including cotton, soybeans, fruits, nuts, vegetables and ornamentals.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Health Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Routes of entry: Employees may be exposed:</p><p class="depth0">1. Through inhalation (breathing);</p><p class="depth0">2. Through ingestion (swallowing);</p><p class="depth0">3. Skin contact; and</p><p class="depth0">4. Eye contact.</p><p class="depth0">B. Effects of exposure:</p><p class="depth0">1. Acute exposure. DBCP may cause drowsiness, irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and skin, nausea and vomiting. In addition, overexposure may cause damage to the lungs, liver or kidneys.</p><p class="depth0">2. Chronic exposure. Prolonged or repeated exposure to DBCP has been shown to cause sterility in humans. It also has been shown to produce cancer and sterility in laboratory animals and has been determined to constitute an increased risk of cancer in man.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reporting Signs and Symptoms. If you develop any of the above signs or symptoms that you think are caused by exposure to DBCP, you should inform your employer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Emergency First Aid Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Eye exposure. If DBCP liquid or dust containing DBCP gets into your eyes, wash your eyes immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the lower and upper lids occasionally. Get medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">B. Skin exposure. If DBCP liquids or dusts containing DBCP get on your skin, immediately wash using soap or mild detergent and water. If DBCP liquids or dusts containing DBCP penetrate through your clothing, remove the clothing immediately and wash. If irritation is present after washing get medical attention.</p><p class="depth0">C. Breathing. If you or any person breathe in large amounts of DBCP, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform artificial respiration. Do not use mouth-to-mouth. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">D. Swallowing. When DBCP has been swallowed and the person is conscious, give the person large amounts of water immediately. After the water has been swallowed, try to get the person to vomit by having him touch the back of his throat with his finger. Do not make an unconscious person vomit. Get medical attention immediately.</p><p class="depth0">E. Rescue. Notify someone. Put into effect the established emergency rescue procedures. Know the locations of the emergency rescue equipment before the need arises.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Respirators and Protective Clothing</p><p class="depth0">A. Respirators. You may be required to wear a respirator in emergencies and while your employer is in the process of reducing DBCP exposures through engineering controls. If respirators are worn, they must have a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approval label (Older respirators may have a Bureau of Mines Approval label). For effective protection, a respirator must fit your face and head snugly. The respirator should not be loosened or removed in work situations where its use is required. DBCP does not have a detectable odor except at 1,000 times or more above the permissible exposure limit. If you can smell DBCP while wearing a respirator, the respirator is not working correctly; go immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Protective clothing. When working with DBCP you must wear for your protection impermeable work clothing provided by your employer. (Standard rubber and neoprene

protective clothing do not offer adequate protection).</p><p class="depth0">DBCP must never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes must not be allowed to become contaminated with DBCP, and if they do, they must be promptly removed and not worn again until completely free of DBCP. Turn in impermeable clothing that has developed leaks for repair or replacement.</p><p class="depth0">C. Eye protection. You must wear splash-proof safety goggles where there is any possibility of DBCP liquid or dust contacting your eyes.</p><p class="depth0">v. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage</p><p class="depth0">A. DBCP must be stored in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated area.</p><p class="depth0">B. If your work clothing may have become contaminated with DBCP, or liquids or dusts containing DBCP, you must change into uncontaminated clothing before leaving the work premises.</p><p class="depth0">C. You must promptly remove any protective clothing that becomes contaminated with DBCP. This clothing must not be reworn until the DBCP is removed from the clothing.</p><p class="depth0">D. If your skin becomes contaminated with DBCP, you must immediately and thoroughly wash or shower with soap or mild detergent and water to remove any DBCP from your skin.</p><p class="depth0">E. You must not keep food, beverages, cosmetics, or smoking materials, nor eat or smoke, in regulated areas.</p><p class="depth0">F. If you work in a regulated area, you must wash your hands thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water, before eating, smoking or using toilet facilities.</p><p class="depth0">G. If you work in a regulated area, you must remove any protective equipment or clothing before leaving the regulated area.</p><p class="depth0">H. Ask your supervisor where DBCP is used in your work area and for any additional safety and health rules.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Access to Information</p><p class="depth0">A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the information contained in this Substance Safety Data Sheet for DBCP. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the safe use of DBCP, emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment.</p><p class="depth0">B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to DBCP. You or your representative have the right to observe employee exposure measurements and to record the result obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines that you are being overexposed, he is required to inform you of the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure.</p><p class="depth0">C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposure and medical examinations. Your employer is required to keep exposure and medical data for at least 40 years or the duration of your employment plus 20 years, whichever is longer.</p><p class="depth0">D. Your employer is required to release exposure and medical records to you, your physician, or other individual designated by you upon your written request.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B toSec. 1910.1044--Substance Technical Guidelines for DBCP</p><p class="depth0">i. Physical and Chemical Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Substance Identification</p><p class="depth0">1. Synonyms: 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane; DBCP, Fumazone; Nemafume; Nemagon; Nemaset; BBC 12; OS 1879. DBCP is also included in agricultural pesticides and fumigants which include the phrase ``Nema--'' in their name.</p><p class="depth0">2. Formula: C3H5Br2 C1.</p><p class="depth0">3. Molecular Weight: 236.</p><p class="depth0">B. Physical Data:</p><p class="depth0">1. Boiling point (760 mm HG): 195C (383F)</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific gravity (water=1): 2.093.</p><p class="depth0">3. Vapor density (air=1 at boiling point of DBCP): Data not available.</p><p class="depth0">4. Melting point: 6C (43F).</p><p class="depth0">5. Vapor pressure at 20C (68F): 0.8 mm Hg</p><p class="depth0">6. Solubility in water: 1000 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">7. Evaporation rate (Butyl Acetate=1): very much less than 1.</p><p class="depth0">8. Appearance and odor: Dense yellow or amber liquid with a pungent odor at high concentrations. Any detectable odor of DBCP indicates overexposure.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fire Explosion and Reactivity Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Fire</p><p class="depth0">1. Flash point: 170F (77C)</p><p class="depth0">2. Autoignition temperature: Data not available.</p><p class="depth0">3. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Data not available.</p><p class="depth0">4. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical.</p><p class="depth0">5. Special fire-fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of water since a stream will scatter and spread the fire. Use water spray to cool containers exposed to a fire.</p><p class="depth0">6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: None known.</p><p class="depth0">7. For purposes of complying with the requirements ofSec. 1910.106, liquid DBCP is classified as a Category 4 flammable liquid.</p><p class="depth0">8. For the purpose of complying withSec. 1910.309, the classification of hazardous locations as described in article 500 of the National Electrical Code for DBCP shall be Class I, Group D.</p><p class="depth0">9. For the purpose of compliance withSec. 1910.157, DBCP is classified as a Class B fire hazard.</p><p class="depth0">10. For the purpose of compliance withSec. 1910.178, locations classified as hazardous locations due to the presence of DBCP shall be Class I, Group D.</p><p class="depth0">11. Sources of ignition are prohibited where DBCP presents a fire or explosion hazard.</p><p class="depth0">B. Reactivity</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions contributing to instability: None known.</p><p class="depth0">2. Incompatibilities: Reacts with chemically active metals, such as aluminum, magnesium and tin alloys.</p><p class="depth0">3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as HBr, HCl and carbon monoxide) may be released in a fire involving DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">4. Special precautions: DBCP will attack some rubber materials and coatings.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Spill, Leak and Disposal Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. If DBCP is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken:</p><p class="depth0">1. The area should be evacuated at once and re-entered only after thorough ventilation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Ventilate area of spill or leak.</p><p class="depth0">3. If in liquid form, collect for reclamation or absorb in paper, vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material.</p><p class="depth0">4. If in solid form, collect spilled material in the most convenient and safe manner for reclamation or for disposal.</p><p class="depth0">B. Persons not wearing protective equipment must be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed.</p><p class="depth0">C. Waste Disposal Methods:</p><p class="depth0">1. For small quantities of liquid DBCP, absorb on paper towels, remove to a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn the paper. Large quantities can be reclaimed or collected and atomized in a suitable combustion chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning device. If liquid DBCP is absorbed in vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material and placed in sealed containers it may be disposed of in a State-approved sanitary landfill.</p><p class="depth0">2. If in solid form, for small quantities, place on paper towels, remove to a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn. Large quantities may be reclaimed. However, if this is not practical, dissolve in a flammable solvent (such as alcohol) and atomize in a suitable combustion chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning device. DBCP in solid form may also be disposed in a state-approved sanitary landfill.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Exposure above the permissible exposure limit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Eight Hour Exposure Evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best taken so that the average 8-hour exposure may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee).</p><p class="depth0">2. Monitoring Techniques: The sampling and analysis under this section may be performed by collecting the DBCP vapor on petroleum based charcoal absorption tubes with subsequent chemical analyses. The method of measurement chosen should determine the concentration of airborne DBCP at the permissible exposure limit to an accuracy of plus or minus 25 percent. If charcoal tubes are used, a total volume of 10 liters should be collected at a flow rate of 50 cc. per minute for each tube. Analyze the resultant samples as you would samples of halogenated solvent.</p><p class="depth0">B. Since many of the duties relating to employee protection are dependent on the results of monitoring and measuring procedures, employers should assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is performed by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically qualified person.</p><p class="depth0">v. Protective Clothing</p><p class="depth0">Employees should be required to wear appropriate protective clothing to prevent any possibility of skin contact with DBCP. Because DBCP is absorbed through the skin, it is important to prevent skin contact with both liquid and solid forms of DBCP. Protective clothing should include impermeable coveralls or similar fullbody work clothing, gloves, headcoverings, and workshoes or shoe coverings. Standard rubber and neoprene gloves do not offer adequate protection and should not be relied upon to keep DBCP off the skin. DBCP should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated with the material, and if they do, they should be promptly removed and not worn again until completely free of the material. Any protective clothing which has developed leaks or is otherwise found to be defective should be repaired or replaced. Employees should also be required to wear splash-proof safety goggles where there is any possibility of DBCP contacting the eyes.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities</p><p class="depth0">1. The workplace must be kept clean, orderly and in a sanitary condition;</p><p class="depth0">2. Dry sweeping and the use of compressed air is unsafe for the cleaning of floors and other surfaces where DBCP dust or liquids are found. To minimize the contamination of air with dust, vacuuming with either portable or permanent systems must be used. If a portable unit is selected, the exhaust must be attached to the general workplace exhaust ventilation system, or collected within

the vacuum unit equipped with high efficiency filters or other appropriate means of contamination removal and not used for other purposes. Units used to collect DBCP must be labeled.</p><p class="depth0">3. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water must be provided, and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of DBCP from the skin.</p><p class="depth0">4. Change or dressing rooms with individual clothes storage facilities must be provided to prevent the contamination of street clothes with DBCP. Because of the hazardous nature of DBCP, contaminated protective clothing must be stored in closed containers for cleaning or disposal.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Miscellaneous Precautions</p><p class="depth0">A. Store DBCP in tightly closed containers in a cool, well ventilated area.</p><p class="depth0">B. Use of supplied-air suits or other impervious clothing (such as acid suits) may be necessary to prevent skin contact with DBCP. Supplied-air suits should be selected, used, and maintained under the supervision of persons knowlegeable in the limitations and potential life-endangering characteristics of supplied-air suits.</p><p class="depth0">C. The use of air-conditioned suits may be necessary in warmer climates.</p><p class="depth0">D. Advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to DBCP could occur.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Common Operations</p><p class="depth0">Common operations in which exposure to DBCP is likely to occur are: during its production; and during its formulation into pesticides and fumigants.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C toSec. 1910.1044--Medical Surveillance Guidelines For DBCP</p><p class="depth0">i. Route of Entry</p><p class="depth0">Inhalation; skin absorption</p><p class="depth0">ii. Toxicology</p><p class="depth0">Recent data collected on workers involved in the manufacture and formulation of DBCP has shown that DBCP can cause sterility at very low levels of exposure. This finding is supported by studies showing that DBCP causes sterility in animals. Chronic exposure to DBCP resulted in pronounced necrotic action on the parenchymatous organs (i.e., liver, kidney, spleen) and on the testicles of rats at concentrations as low as 5 ppm. Rats that were chronically exposed to DBCP also showed changes in the composition of the blood, showing low RBC, hemoglobin, and WBC, and high reticulocyte levels as well as functional hepatic disturbance, manifesting itself in a long prothrombin time. Reznik et al. noted a single dose of 100 mg produced profound depression of the nervous system of rats. Their condition gradually improved. Acute exposure also resulted in the destruction of the sex gland activity of male rats as well as causing changes in the estrous cycle in female rats. Animal studies have also associated DBCP with an increased incidence of carcinoma. Olson, et al. orally administered DBCP to rats and mice 5 times per week at experimentally predetermined maximally tolerated doses and at half those doses. As early as ten weeks after initiation of treatment, DBCP induced a high incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach with metastases in both species. DBCP also induced mammary adenocarcinomas in the female rats at both dose levels.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Signs and Symptoms</p><p class="depth0">A. Inhalation: Nausea, eye irritation, conjunctivitis, respiratory irritation, pulmonary congestion or edema, CNS depression with apathy, sluggishness, and ataxia.</p><p class="depth0">B. Dermal: Erythema or inflammation and dermatitis on repeated exposure.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Special Tests</p><p class="depth0">A. Semen analysis: The following information excerpted from the document ``Evaluation of Testicular Function'', submitted by the Corporate Medical Department of the Shell Oil Company (exhibit 39-3), may be useful to physicians conducting the medical surveillance program;</p><p class="depth0">In performing semen analyses certain minimal but specific criteria should be met:</p><p class="depth0">1. It is recommended that a minimum of three valid semen analyses be obtained in order to make a determination of an individual's average sperm count.</p><p class="depth0">2. A period of sexual abstinence is necessary prior to the collection of each masturbatory sample. It is recommended that intercourse or masturbation be performed 48 hours before the actual specimen collection. A period of 48 hours of abstinence would follow; then the masturbatory sample would be collected.</p><p class="depth0">3. Each semen specimen should be collected in a clean, widemouthed, glass jar (not necessarily pre-sterilized) in a manner designated by the examining physician. Any part of the seminal fluid exam should be initialed only after liquifaction is complete, i.e., 30 to 45 minutes after collection.</p><p class="depth0">4. Semen volume should be measured to the nearest \1/10\ of a cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth0">5. Sperm density should be determined using routine techniques involving the use of a white cell pipette and a hemocytometer chamber. The immobilizing fluid most effective and most easily obtained for this process is distilled water.</p><p class="depth0">6. Thin, dry smears of the semen should be made for a morphologic classification of the sperm forms and should be stained with either hematoxalin or the more difficult, yet more precise, Papanicolaou technique. Also

of importance to record is obvious sperm agglutination, pyospermia, delayed liquifaction (greater than 30 minutes), and hyperviscosity. In addition, pH, using nitrazine paper, should be determined.</p><p class="depth0">7. A total morphology evaluation should include percentages of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Normal (oval) forms,</p><p class="depth0">b. Tapered forms,</p><p class="depth0">c. Amorphous forms (include large and small sperm shapes),</p><p class="depth0">d. Duplicated (either heads or tails) forms, and</p><p class="depth0">e. Immature forms.</p><p class="depth0">8. Each sample should be evaluated for sperm viability (percent viable sperm moving at the time of examination) as well as sperm motility (subjective characterization of ``purposeful forward sperm progression'' of the majority of those viable sperm analyzed) within two hours after collection, ideally by the same or equally qualified examiner.</p><p class="depth0">B. Serum determinations: The following serum determinations should be performed by radioimmuno-assay techniques using National Institutes of Health (NIH) specific antigen or antigen preparations of equivalent sensitivity:</p><p class="depth0">1. Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH);</p><p class="depth0">2. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH); and</p><p class="depth0">3. Serum total estrogen (females only).</p><p class="depth0">v. Treatment</p><p class="depth0">Remove from exposure immediately, give oxygen or artificial resuscitation if indicated. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed immediately. Flush eyes and wash contaminated skin. If swallowed and the person is conscious, induce vomiting. Recovery from mild exposures is usually rapid and complete.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations</p><p class="depth0">A. Other considerations. DBCP can cause both acute and chronic effects. It is important that the physician become familiar with the operating conditions in which exposure to DBCP occurs. Those with respiratory disorders may not tolerate the wearing of negative pressure respirators.</p><p class="depth0">B. Surveillance and screening. Medical histories and laboratory examinations are required for each employee subject to exposure to DBCP. The employer should screen employees for history of certain medical conditions (listed below) which might place the employee at increased risk from exposure.</p><p class="depth0">1. Liver disease. The primary site of biotransformation and detoxification of DBCP is the liver. Liver dysfunctions likely to inhibit the conjugation reactions will tend to promote the toxic actions of DBCP. These precautions should be considered before exposing persons with impaired liver function to DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">2. Renal disease. Because DBCP has been associated with injury to the kidney it is important that special consideration be given to those with possible impairment of renal function.</p><p class="depth0">3. Skin desease. DBCP can penetrate the skin and can cause erythema on prolonged exposure. Persons with pre-existing skin disorders may be more susceptible to the effects of DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">4. Blood dyscrasias. DBCP has been shown to decrease the content of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and leukocytes in the blood, as well as increase the prothrombin time. Persons with existing blood disorders may be more susceptible to the effects of DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">5. Reproductive disorders. Animal studies have associated DBCP with various effects on the reproductive organs. Among these effects are atrophy of the testicles and changes in the estrous cycle. Persons with pre-existing reproductive disorders may be at increased risk to these effects of DBCP.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1. Reznik, Ya. B. and Sprinchan, G.
