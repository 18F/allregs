In instances where one or more assembled machines or units of equipment are being exported, the individual component parts that are physically incorporated into the machine or equipment do not require a license. The license or general exception under which the complete machine or unit of equipment is exported will also cover its component parts, provided that the parts are normal and usual components of the machine or equipment being exported, or that the physical incorporation is not used as a device to evade the requirement for a license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An assembled machine or unit of equipment is being exported.

A computer with add-on ``motion control boards'' for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a even when the computer alone without ``motion control boards'' is not subject to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the ``motion control boards'' are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classification of ``Numerical Control'' Units. ``Numerical control'' units for machine tools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, are controlled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN 2B001.a. ``Numerical control'' units include computers with add-on ``motion control boards''.

When either a control unit or a machine is shipped separately, it should be reported under the Schedule B number appropriate for the individual item being exported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Interpretation 6: ``Parts,'' ``accessories,'' and equipment exported as scrap. ``Parts,'' ``accessories,'' or equipment that are being shipped as scrap should be described on the EEI filing to the AES in sufficient detail to be identified under the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as ``parts,'' ``accessories,'' or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged, packed, or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, the Customs Officer may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, orders and correspondence indicating whether the commodities are scrap or are being exported for use as ``parts,'' ``accessories,'' or equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements of war.

When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should consult the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)--(j)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Interpretation 11: Precursor chemicals.

Assemblies performing analog-to-digital conversions are evaluated under Category 3--Electronics, ECCN 3A001.a.5.a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Digital computers or computer systems classified under ECCN 4A003.b or .c, that qualify for ``No License Required'' (NLR) must be evaluated on the basis of Adjusted Peak Performance (APP) alone, to the exclusion of all other technical parameters. Digital computers or computer systems classified under ECCN 4A003.b or .c that qualify for License Exception APP must be evaluated on the basis of APP, to the exclusion of all other technical parameters, except for ECCN 4A003.e (equipment performing analog-to-digital conversions exceeding the limits in ECCN 3A001.a.5.a). Assemblies performing analog-to-digital conversions are evaluated under Category 3--Electronics, ECCN 3A001.a.5.a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Related equipment classified under ECCN 4A003.e or .g may be exported or reexported under License Exceptions GBS or CIV. When related equipment is exported or reexported as part of a computer system, NLR or License Exception APP is available for the computer system and the related equipment, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Interpretation 13: Encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons. Encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002 may be pre-loaded on a laptop, handheld device or other computer or equipment and exported under the tools of trade provision of License Exception TMP or the personal use exemption under License Exception BAG, subject to the terms and conditions of such License Exceptions. This provision replaces the personal use exemption of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) that existed for such software prior to December 30, 1996. Neither License Exception TMP nor License Exception BAG contains a reporting requirement. Like other ``information security'' ``software'', components, ``electronic assemblies'' or modules, the control status of encryption commodities and software is determined in Category 5, part 2 even if they are bundled, commingled or incorporated in a computer or other equipment. However, commodities and software specially designed for medical end-use that incorporate an item in Category 5, part 2 are not controlled in Category 5, part 2. See Note 1 to Category 5, part 2 (``Information Security'') of Supplement No. 1 to Part 774 (the Commerce Control List) of the EAR.
