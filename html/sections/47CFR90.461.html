                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Radio transmitters may be operated and controlled  directly (as when the operating position for the transmitter and the  transmitter being operated are at the same location), or remotely (as  when the transmitter being operated and the position from which it is  being operated are at different locations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Control of transmitters at remote locations. Radio transmitters  at remote locations may be operated and controlled through the use of  wire line or radio links; or through dial-up circuits, as provided in  paragraph (c) of this section. Such control links or circuits may be  either those of the licensee or they may be provided by common carriers  authorized by law to furnish such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dial-up circuits. Dial-up circuits may be provided by wire line  telephone companies under appropriate tariffs, and they may be used by  licensees for purposes of transmitter control, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dial-up circuits serve only to link licensed transmitter  control points and the transmitters being controlled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dial-up circuits are so designed that the transmitters being  controlled cannot be operated from any fixed position other than the  licensed control points for those transmitters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Equipment used to provide the transmitter/dial-up-circuit  interface is designed to preclude associated mobile units of the  licensee from reaching any point(s) served by the wire line telephone  facilities other than the control point(s) of the station(s) controlled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any direct electrical connection to the telephone network shall  comply with applicable tariffs and with part 68 of the Commission's  Rules (See Sec. 90.5(j)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Interconnection, within the meaning of Sec. Sec. 90.7 and  90.477 through 90.483, may not take place at a control point which  connects to its associated transmitter(s) through dial-up circuits; nor  may such dial-up transmitter control circuits be used in conjunction  with (or shared by) interconnection equipment.
