                                Sec. 1.825-2  Unused loss carryovers and carrybacks.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Years to which loss may be carried--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In order to  determine its unused loss deduction for any taxable year, a mutual  insurance company taxable under section 821(a) must first determine the  part of any unused losses for any preceding or succeeding taxable years  which are carryovers or carrybacks to the taxable year in issue. An  unused loss is to be an unused loss carryback to each of the 3 taxable  years preceding the loss year, and an unused loss carryover to each of  the 5 taxable years following the loss year, subject to the limitations  provided in section 825(g) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. An unused loss may not be carried:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To or from any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To or from any taxable year for which the taxpayer is not  subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a), nor</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To any taxable year if, between the loss year and such taxable  year, there is an intervening taxable year for which the taxpayer was  not subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Periods of less than 12 months. A fractional part of a year  which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) is a  preceding or a succeeding taxable year for the purpose of determining  under section 825 the first, second, etc., preceding or succeeding  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loss year defined. The term ``loss year'' as used in this  section means any taxable year for which a company subject to the tax  imposed by section 821(a) has an unused loss in excess of zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of carrybacks and carryovers. Section 825(e) provides  that in the case of a loss year for a company taxable under section  821(a), the entire amount of the unused loss shall be carried to the  earliest taxable year to which such loss may be carried under section  825(d) (subject to the limitations of section 825(g)). The amount of the  unused loss carried to each of the other taxable years to which such  loss may be carried under section 825(d) following such earliest taxable  year shall be the excess (if any) of such loss over the sum of the  offsets for each taxable year preceding the taxable year to which the  unused loss is carried.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Offset defined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 825(f) defines the term  ``offset'' and provides that the taxable year to which an unused loss is  carried shall be referred to as the ``offset year''. The definition of  the term offset in the case of an unused loss carryback to an offset  year, differs from the definition of such term in the case of an unused  loss carryover to an offset year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Offset in case of carryback. In the case of an unused loss  carryback from the loss year to the offset year, the offset is the  mutual insurance company taxable income for the offset year, computed  without regard to any unused loss carryback from the loss year or any  taxable year thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offset in case of carryover. In the case of an unused loss  carryover from the loss year to the offset year, the offset is equal to  the sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount required to be subtracted from the protection against  loss account under section 824(d)(1)(C) (relating to amounts equal to  the unused loss carryovers to the offset year), plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mutual insurance company taxable income for the taxable  year, computed without regard to any unused loss carryback or carryover  from the loss year or any taxable year thereafter.
