                            <p class="depth0">[Statutory Provisions]</p><p class="depth0">High-voltage circuits entering the underground area of any coal mine shall be protected by suitable circuit breakers of adequate interrupting capacity which are properly tested and maintained as prescribed by the Secretary. Such breakers shall be equipped with devices to provide protection against under-voltage grounded phase, short circuit, and overcurrent.


Sec. 75.800-1  Circuit breakers; location.</p><p class="depth0">Circuit breakers protecting high-voltage circuits entering an underground area of any coal mine shall be located on the surface and in no case

installed either underground or within a drift.


Sec. 75.800-2  Approved circuit schemes.</p><p class="depth0">The following circuit schemes will be regarded as providing the necessary protection to the circuits required by Sec. 75.800:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Ground check relays may be used for undervoltage protection if the relay coils are designed to trip the circuit breaker when line voltage decreases to 40 percent to 60 percent of the nominal line voltage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ground trip relays on resistance grounded systems will be acceptable as grounded phase protection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> One circuit breaker may be used to protect two or more branch circuits, if the circuit breaker is adjusted to afford overcurrent protection for the smallest conductor.


Sec. 75.800-3  Testing, examination and maintenance of circuit breakers;procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Circuit breakers and their auxiliary devices protecting underground high-voltage circuits shall be tested and examined at least once each month by a person qualified as provided in Sec. 75.153;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Tests shall include: (1) Breaking continuity of the ground check conductor, where ground check monitoring is used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actuating at least two (2) of the auxiliary protective relays.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examination shall include visual observation of all components of the circuit breaker and its auxiliary devices, and such repairs or adjustments as are indicated by such tests and examinations shall be carried out immediately.


Sec. 75.800-4  Testing, examination, and maintenance of circuit breakers;record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Recordkeeping. The operator shall make a record of each test, examination, repair, or adjustment of all circuit breakers protecting high-voltage circuits which enter any underground area of the mine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Record security. These records shall be made in a secure book that is not susceptible to alteration or electronically in a computer system so as to be secure and not susceptible to alteration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Retention and access. These records shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and shall be made available to authorized representatives of the Secretary, the representative of miners, and other interested persons.
