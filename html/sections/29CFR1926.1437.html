                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section contains supplemental requirements for floating cranes/derricks and land cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation (i.e., vessel/flotation device). The sections of this subpart apply to floating cranes/derricks and land cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation, unless specified otherwise. The requirements of this section do not apply when using jacked barges when the jacks are deployed to the river, lake, or sea bed and the barge is fully supported by the jacks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. The requirements in paragraphs (c) through (k) of this section apply to both floating cranes/derricks and land cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels or other means of flotation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Work area control. (1) The requirements of Sec. 1926.1424 (Work area control) apply, except for Sec. 1926.1424(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employer must either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Erect and maintain control lines, warning lines, railings or similar barriers to mark the boundaries of the hazard areas; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clearly mark the hazard areas by a combination of warning signs (such as, ``Danger--Swing/Crush Zone'') and high visibility markings on the equipment that identify the hazard areas. In addition, the employer must train each employee to understand what these markings signify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Keeping clear of the load. Section 1926.1425 does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional safety devices. In addition to the safety devices listed in Sec. 1926.1415, the following safety devices are required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Barge, pontoon, vessel or other means of flotation list and trim device. The safety device must be located in the cab or, when there is no cab, at the operator's station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Positive equipment house lock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wind speed and direction indicator. A competent person must determine if wind is a factor that needs to be considered; if wind needs to be considered, a wind speed and direction indicator must be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Operational aids. (1) An anti two-block device is required only when hoisting personnel or hoisting over an occupied cofferdam or shaft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 1926.1416(e)(4) (Load weighing and similar devices) does not apply to dragline, clamshell (grapple), magnet, drop ball, container handling, concrete bucket, and pile driving work performed under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Accessibility of procedures applicable to equipment operation. If the crane/derrick has a cab, the requirements of Sec. 1926.1417(c) apply. If the crane/derrick does not have a cab, the employer must ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rated capacities (load charts) are posted at the operator's station. If the operator's station is moveable (such as with pendant-controlled equipment), the load charts are posted on the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures applicable to the operation of the equipment (other than load charts), recommended operating speeds, special hazard warnings, instructions and operators manual, must be readily available on board the vessel/flotation device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Inspections. In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 1926.1412 for inspecting the crane/derrick, the employer must inspect the barge, pontoons, vessel or other means of flotation used to support a floating crane/derrick or land crane/derrick, and ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Shift. For each shift inspection, the means used to secure/attach the equipment to the vessel/flotation device is in proper condition, including

wear, corrosion, loose or missing fasteners, defective welds, and (when applicable) insufficient tension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monthly.
