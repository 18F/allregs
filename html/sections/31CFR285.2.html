                                Sec. 285.2  Offset of tax refund payments to collect past-due,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Creditor agency means a Federal agency owed a claim that seeks to  collect that claim through tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth2">Debt or claim refers to an amount of money, funds, or property which  has been determined by an agency official to be due the United States  from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency.  For the purposes of this section, the terms ``claim'' and ``debt'' are  synonymous and interchangeable and includes debt administered by a third  party acting as an agent for the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2">Debtor means a person who owes a debt or claim. The term ``person''  includes any individual, organization or entity, except another Federal  agency.</p><p class="depth2">Fiscal Service means the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a bureau of  the Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth2">IRS means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department  of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth2">Tax refund offset means withholding or reducing a tax refund payment  by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the payee(s) of a tax  refund payment.</p><p class="depth2">Tax refund payment means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be  refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the  appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402- 3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any tax on the part of the person who  made the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Federal agency (as defined in 26 U.S.C.  6402(g)) that is owed by a person a past-due, legally enforceable nontax  debt shall notify Fiscal Service of the amount of such debt for  collection by tax refund offset. However, any agency subject to section  9 of the Act of May 18, 1933 (16 U.S.C. 831h) owed such a debt may, but  is not required to, notify Fiscal Service of the amount of such debt for  collection by tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as  certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service.  A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is  used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name (or derivation of the name, known as a  ``name control'') of a payment certification record are the same as the  taxpayer identifying number and name control of a debtor record. When a  match occurs and all other requirements for tax refund offset have been  met, Fiscal Service will reduce the amount of any tax refund payment  payable to a debtor by the   amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed by the debtor. Any  amounts not offset will be paid to the payee(s) listed in the payment  certification record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This section does not apply to any debt or claim arising under  the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This section applies to Federal Old Age, Survivors and  Disability Insurance (OASDI) overpayments provided the requirements of  31 U.S.C. 3720A(f)(1) and (2) are met with respect to such overpayments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, OASDI overpayment means any  overpayment of benefits made to an individual under title II of the  Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A creditor agency is not precluded from using debt collection  procedures, such as wage garnishment, to collect debts that have been  submitted to Fiscal Service for purposes of offset under this part. Such  debt collection procedures may be used separately or in conjunction with  offset collection procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulations. Prior to submitting debts to Fiscal Service for  collection by tax refund offset, Federal agencies shall promulgate  temporary or final regulations under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 31 U.S.C. 3720A,  governing the agencies' authority to collect debts by administrative  offset, in general, and offset of tax refund payments, in particular.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency certification and referral of debt--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Past-due, legally  enforceable debt eligible for tax refund offset. For purposes of this  section, when a Federal agency refers a past-due, legally enforceable  debt to Fiscal Service for tax refund offset, the agency will certify to  Fiscal Service that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount  submitted to Fiscal Service and that the agency will ensure that  collections are properly credited to the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain  payment of the debt in that the agency has:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Submitted the debt to Fiscal Service for collection by  administrative offset and complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C.  3716(a) and related regulations, to the extent that collection of the  debt by administrative offset is not prohibited by statute;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the debtor  that the debt is past-due, and unless repaid within 60 days after the  date of the notice, will be referred to Fiscal Service for tax refund  offset;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all  or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, considered  any evidence presented by the debtor, and determined that the debt is  past-due and legally enforceable; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Provided the debtor with an opportunity to make a written  agreement to repay the amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The debt is at least $25; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of an OASDI overpayment--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The individual is not currently entitled to monthly insurance  benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et  seq.);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The notice describes conditions under which the Commissioner of  Social Security is required to waive recovery of the overpayment, as  provided under 42 U.S.C. 404(b); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the debtor files a request for a waiver under 42 U.S.C.  404(b) within the 60-day notice period, the agency has considered the  debtor's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pre-offset notice and consideration of evidence for past-due,  legally enforceable debt. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B)  of this section, a creditor agency has made a reasonable attempt to  notify the debtor if the agency uses the current address information  contained in the agency's records related to the debt. Agencies may, but  are not required to, obtain address information from the IRS pursuant to  26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2), (4), or (5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, if  the evidence presented by the debtor is considered by an agent of the  creditor agency, or other entities or persons acting on the agency's  behalf, the debtor must be accorded at least 30 days from the date the  agent or other entity or person determines that all or part of the debt  is past-due and legally enforceable to request review by an officer or  employee of the agency of any   unresolved dispute. The agency must then notify the debtor of its  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Referral of past-due, legally enforceable debt. A Federal agency  will submit past-due, legally enforceable debt information for tax  refund offset to Fiscal Service in the time and manner prescribed by  Fiscal Service. For each debt, the creditor agency will include the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and taxpayer identifying number (as defined in 26  U.S.C. 6109) of the debtor who is responsible for the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of such past-due and legally enforceable debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date on which the debt became past-due;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The designation of the Federal agency or subagency referring  the debt; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the case of an OASDI overpayment, a certification by the  Commissioner of Social Security designating whether the amount payable  to the agency is to be deposited in either the Federal Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust  Fund, but not both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Correcting and updating referral. If, after referring a past- due, legally enforceable debt to Fiscal Service as provided in paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, a creditor agency determines that an error has  been made with respect to the information transmitted to Fiscal Service,  or if an agency receives a payment or credits a payment to the account  of a debtor referred to Fiscal Service for offset, or if the debt amount  is otherwise incorrect, the agency shall promptly notify Fiscal Service  and make the appropriate correction of the agency's records. Creditor  agencies will provide certification as required under paragraph (d)(1)  of this section for any increases to amounts owed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fiscal Service may reject a certification which does not comply  with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Upon  notification of the rejection and the reason for the rejection, a  creditor agency may resubmit the debt with a corrected certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Creditor agencies may submit debts to Fiscal Service for  collection by tax refund offset irrespective of the amount of time the  debt has been outstanding. Accordingly, all nontax debts, including  debts that were delinquent for ten years or longer prior to December 28,  2009 may be collected by tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this  section was sent to the debtor after the debt became ten years  delinquent. This requirement will apply even in a case where notice was  also sent prior to the debt becoming ten years delinquent, but does not  apply to any debt that could be collected by offset without regard to  any time limitation prior to December 28, 2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Post-offset notice to the debtor, the creditor agency, and the  IRS. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fiscal Service will notify the payee(s) to whom the tax  refund payment is due, in writing of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount and date of the offset to satisfy a past-due, legally  enforceable nontax debt;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The creditor agency to which this amount has been paid or  credited; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A contact point within the creditor agency that will handle  concerns or questions regarding the offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section will also  advise any non-debtor spouse who may have filed a joint tax return with  the debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to  secure his or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Service will advise each creditor agency of the names,  mailing addresses, and identifying numbers of the debtors from whom  amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and of the  amounts collected from each debtor for that agency. Fiscal Service will  not advise the creditor agency of the source of payment from which such  amounts were collected. If a payment from which an amount of past-due,  legally enforceable debt is to be withheld is payable to two individual  payees, Fiscal Service will notify the creditor agency and furnish the  name and address of each payee to whom the payment was payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names  and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of  past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and the amounts  collected from each debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Offset made with regard to a tax refund payment based upon joint  return. If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the  past-due, legally enforceable debt takes appropriate action to secure  his or her proper share of a tax refund from which an offset was made,  the IRS will pay the person his or her share of the refund and request  that Fiscal Service deduct that amount from amounts payable to the  creditor agency. Fiscal Service and the creditor agency will adjust  their debtor records accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of amounts collected. Fiscal Service will transmit  amounts collected for past-due, legally enforceable debts, less fees  charged under paragraph (h) of this section, to the creditor agency's  account. If an erroneous payment is made to any agency, Fiscal Service  will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous payment has been made.  The agency shall pay promptly to Fiscal Service an amount equal to the  amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other  amounts payable to such agency have been paid).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees. The creditor agency will reimburse Fiscal Service and the  IRS for the full cost of administering the tax refund offset program.  Fiscal Service will deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to  disposition and transmit a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the  IRS for its share of the cost of administering the tax refund offset  program. To the extent allowed by law, creditor agencies may add the  offset fees to the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Review of tax refund offsets. Any reduction of a taxpayer's  refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) shall not be subject to review  by any court of the United States or by the Secretary of the Treasury,  Fiscal Service or IRS in an administrative proceeding. No action brought  against the United States to recover the amount of this reduction shall  be considered to be a suit for refund of tax. Any legal, equitable, or  administrative action by any person seeking to recover the amount of the  reduction of the overpayment must be taken against the Federal creditor  agency to which the amount of the reduction was paid. Any action which  is otherwise available with respect to recoveries of overpayments of  benefits under 42 U.S.C. 404 must be taken against the Commissioner of  Social Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Access to and use of confidential tax information. Access to and  use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund  offset program are restricted by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Generally, agencies  will not receive confidential tax information from Fiscal Service. To  the extent such information is received, agencies are subject to the  safeguard, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C.  6103(p)(4) and the regulations thereunder. The agency shall inform its  officers and employees who access or use confidential tax information of  the restrictions and penalties under the Internal Revenue Code for  misuse of confidential tax information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Effective date. This section applies to tax refund payments  payable under 26 U.S.C. 6402 after January 1, 1998.  [62 FR 34179, June 25, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 27433, June 10, 2009;  74 FR 68538, Dec. 28, 2009; 75 FR 746, Jan. 4, 2010]</p>
