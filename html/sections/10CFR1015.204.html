DOE will ensure that all of the rights and protections afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) have been fulfilled. Additional guidance is contained in Treasury's ``Guide to the Federal Credit Bureau Program,'' revised October 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As described in Sec. 1015.201(e), under the DCIA (31 U.S.C. 3711(g)), DOE is required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for purposes of debt collection (i.e., cross-servicing). As part of its regular debt collection procedures, Treasury will report debts it is collecting to the appropriate designated credit reporting agencies on behalf of DOE. A debt not transferred to Treasury for purposes of debt collection, however, may be subject to the DCIA requirement to report all non-tax delinquent consumer debts to credit reporting agencies.</p>
