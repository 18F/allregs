                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OMB authorizes conditional exemption from OMB administrative  requirements and cost principles circulars for certain Federal programs  with statutorily-authorized consolidated planning and consolidated  administrative funding, that are identified by a Federal agency and  approved by the head of the Executive department or establishment. A  Federal agency shall consult with OMB during its consideration of  whether to grant such an exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To promote efficiency in State and local program administration,  when Federal non-entitlement programs with common purposes have specific  statutorily-authorized consolidated planning and consolidated  administrative funding and where most of the State agency's resources  come from non-Federal sources, Federal agencies may exempt these covered  State-administered, non-entitlement grant programs from certain OMB  grants management requirements. The exemptions would be from all but the  allocability of costs provisions of OMB Circulars A-87 (Attachment A,  subsection C.3), ``Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal  Governments,'' A-21 (Section C, subpart 4),   ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' and A-122 (Attachment  A, subsection A.4), ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,''  and from all of the administrative requirements provisions of OMB  Circular A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and  Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other  Non-Profit Organizations,'' and part 43 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a Federal agency provides this flexibility, as a  prerequisite to a State's exercising this option, a State must adopt its  own written fiscal and administrative requirements for expending and  accounting for all funds, which are consistent with the provisions of  OMB Circular A-87, and extend such policies to all subrecipients. These  fiscal and administrative requirements must be sufficiently specific to  ensure that: Funds are used in compliance with all applicable Federal  statutory and regulatory provisions, costs are reasonable and necessary  for operating these programs, and funds are not be used for general  expenses required to carry out other responsibilities of a State or its  subrecipients.
