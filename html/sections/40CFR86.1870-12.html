To claim this credit  the manufacturer must measure the recovered energy over the Federal Test  Procedure according to Sec. 600.116-12(c) to determine whether a vehicle  is a mild or strong hybrid electric vehicle. To provide for EPA testing,  the vehicle must be able to broadcast battery pack voltage via an on- board diagnostics parameter ID channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full size pickup trucks that are mild hybrid electric vehicles  and that are produced in the 2017 through 2021 model years are eligible  for a credit of 10 grams/mile.
