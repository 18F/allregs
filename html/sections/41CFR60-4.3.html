                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of  this chapter is required to be included in, and is part of, all  nonexempt Federal contracts and subcontracts, including construction  contracts and subcontracts. The equal opportunity clause published at 41  CFR 60-1.4(b) is required to be included in, and is a part of, all  nonexempt federally assisted construction contracts and subcontracts. In  addition to the clauses described above, all Federal contracting  officers, all applicants and all nonconstruction contractors, as  applicable, shall include the specifications set forth in this section  in all Federal and federally assisted construction contracts in excess  of $10,000 to be performed in geographical areas designated by the  Director pursuant to Sec. 60-4.6 of this part and in construction  subcontracts in excess of $10,000 necessary in whole or in part to the  performance of nonconstruction Federal contracts and subcontracts  covered under the Executive order.</p><p class="depth2">Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract</p><p class="depth2">Specifications (Executive Order 11246)</p><p class="depth2">1. As used in these specifications:</p><p class="depth2">a. ``Covered area'' means the geographical area described in the  solicitation from which this contract resulted;</p><p class="depth2">b. ``Director'' means Director, Office of Federal Contract  Compliance Programs, United States Department of Labor, or any person to  whom the Director delegates authority;</p><p class="depth2">c. ``Employer identification number'' means the Federal Social  Security number used on the Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,  U.S. Treasury Department Form 941.</p><p class="depth2">d. ``Minority'' includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Black (all persons having origins in any of the Black African  racial groups not of Hispanic origin);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central  or South American or other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of  race);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any  of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian  Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins  in any of the original peoples of North America and maintaining  identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or  community identification).</p><p class="depth4">2. Whenever the Contractor, or any Subcontractor at any tier,  subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction   trade, it shall physically include in each subcontract in excess of  $10,000 the provisions of these specifications and the Notice which  contains the applicable goals for minority and female participation and  which is set forth in the solicitations from which this contract  resulted.</p><p class="depth4">3. If the Contractor is participating (pursuant to 41 CFR 60-4.5) in  a Hometown Plan approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in the covered  area either individually or through an association, its affirmative  action obligations on all work in the Plan area (including goals and  timetables) shall be in accordance with that Plan for those trades which  have unions participating in the Plan. Contractors must be able to  demonstrate their participation in and compliance with the provisions of  any such Hometown Plan. Each Contractor or Subcontractor participating  in an approved Plan is individually required to comply with its  obligations under the EEO clause, and to make a good faith effort to  achieve each goal under the Plan in each trade in which it has  employees. The overall good faith performance by other Contractors or  Subcontractors toward a goal in an approved Plan does not excuse any  covered Contractor's or Subcontractor's failure to take good faith  efforts to achieve the Plan goals and timetables.</p><p class="depth4">4. The Contractor shall implement the specific affirmative action  standards provided in paragraphs 7 a through p of these specifications.  The goals set forth in the solicitation from which this contract  resulted are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment  and training of minority and female utilization the Contractor should  reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has  employees in the covered area. Covered Construction contractors  performing construction work in geographical areas where they do not  have a Federal or federally assisted constuction contract shall apply  the minority and female goals established for the geographical area  where the work is being performed. Goals are published periodically in  the Federal Register in notice form, and such notices may be obtained  from any Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs office or from  Federal procurement contracting officers. The Contractor is expected to  make substantially uniform progress in meeting its goals in each craft  during the period specified.</p><p class="depth4">5. Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement,  nor the failure by a union with whom the Contractor has a collective  bargaining agreement, to refer either minorities or women shall excuse  the Contractor's obligations under these specifications, Executive Order  11246, or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p><p class="depth4">6. In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and  trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, such apprentices and  trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period,  and the Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices  and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the  availability of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained  pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth4">7. The Contractor shall take specific affirmative actions to ensure  equal employment opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor's  compliance with these specifications shall be based upon its effort to  achieve maximum results from its actions. The Contractor shall document  these efforts fully, and shall implement affirmative action steps at  least as extensive as the following:</p><p class="depth4">a. Ensure and maintain a working environment free of harassment,  intimidation, and coercion at all sites, and in all facilities at which  the Contractor's employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, where  possible, will assign two or more women to each construction project.  The Contractor shall specifically ensure that all foremen,  superintendents, and other on-site supervisory personnel are aware of  and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a working  environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals  working at such sites or in such facilities.</p><p class="depth4">b. Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female  recruitment sources, provide written notification to minority and female  recruitment sources and to community organizations when the Contractor  or its unions have employment opportunities available, and maintain a  record of the organizations' responses.</p><p class="depth4">c. Maintain a current file of the names, addresses and telephone  numbers of each minority and female off-the-street applicant and  minority or female referral from a union, a recruitment source or  community organization and of what action was taken with respect to each  such individual. If such individual was sent to the union hiring hall  for referral and was not referred back to the Contractor by the union  or, if referred, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be  documented in the file with the reason therefor, along with whatever  additional actions the Contractor may have taken.</p><p class="depth4">d. Provide immediate written notification to the Director when the  union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining  agreement has not referred to the Contractor a minority person or woman  sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information  that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to  meet its obligations.</p><p class="depth4">e. Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in  training programs   for the area which expressly include minorities and women, including  upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to  the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or  approved by the Department of Labor. The Contractor shall provide notice  of these programs to the sources compiled under 7b above.</p><p class="depth4">f. Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy by providing notice of  the policy to unions and training programs and requesting their  cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its EEO obligations;  by including it in any policy manual and collective bargaining  agreement; by publicizing it in the company newpaper, annual report,  etc.; by specific review of the policy with all management personnel and  with all minority and female employees at least once a year; and by  posting the company EEO policy on bulletin boards accessible to all  employees at each location where construction work is performed.</p><p class="depth4">g. Review, at least annually, the company's EEO policy and  affirmative action obligations under these specifications with all  employees having any responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff,  termination or other employment decisions including specific review of  these items with onsite supervisory personnel such as Superintendents,  General Foremen, etc., prior to the initiation of construction work at  any job site. A written record shall be made and maintained identifying  the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter  discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.</p><p class="depth4">h. Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy externally by including  it in any advertising in the news media, specifically including minority  and female news media, and providing written notification to and  discussing the Contractor's EEO policy with other Contractors and  Subcontractors with whom the Contractor does or anticipates doing  business.</p><p class="depth4">i. Direct its recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to  minority, female and community organizations, to schools with minority  and female students and to minority and female recruitment and training  organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment  needs. Not later than one month prior to the date for the acceptance of  applications for apprenticeship or other training by any recruitment  source, the Contractor shall send written notification to organizations  such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and  tests to be used in the selection process.</p><p class="depth4">j. Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other  minority persons and women and, where reasonable, provide after school,  summer and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the  site and in other areas of a Contractor's work force.</p><p class="depth4">k. Validate all tests and other selection requirements where there  is an obligation to do so under 41 CFR part 60-3.</p><p class="depth4">l. Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least  of all minority and female personnel for promotional opportunities and  encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate  training, etc., such opportunities.</p><p class="depth4">m. Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work  assignments and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory  effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment related  activities to ensure that the EEO policy and the Contractor's  obligations under these specifications are being carried out.</p><p class="depth4">n. Ensure that all facilities and company activities are  nonsegregated except that separate or single-user toilet and necessary  changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between the  sexes.</p><p class="depth4">o. Document and maintain a record of all solicitations of offers for  subcontracts from minority and female construction contractors and  suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female  contractor associations and other business associations.</p><p class="depth4">p. Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors'  adherence to and performance under the Contractor's EEO policies and  affirmative action obligations.</p><p class="depth4">8. Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary  associations which assist in fulfilling one or more of their affirmative  action obligations (7a through p). The efforts of a contractor  association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or other  similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant, may  be asserted as fulfilling any one or more of its obligations under 7a  through p of these Specifications provided that the contractor actively  participates in the group, makes every effort to assure that the group  has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the  industry, ensures that the concrete benefits of the program are  reflected in the Contractor's minority and female workforce  participation, makes a good faith effort to meet its individual goals  and timetables, and can provide access to documentation which  demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the  Contractor. The obligation to comply, however, is the Contractor's and  failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense  for the Contractor's noncompliance.</p><p class="depth4">9. A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women  have been established. The Contractor, however, is required to provide  equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all  minority groups, both male and female, and all   women, both minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may  be in violation of the Executive Order if a particular group is employed  in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even though the  Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor  may be in violation of the Executive Order if a specific minority group  of women is underutilized).</p><p class="depth4">10. The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or  affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because  of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or  national origin.</p><p class="depth4">11. The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any  person or firm debarred from Government contracts pursuant to Executive  Order 11246.</p><p class="depth4">12. The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for  violation of these specifications and of the Equal Opportunity Clause,  including suspension, termination and cancellation of existing  subcontracts as may be imposed or ordered pursuant to Executive Order  11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the Office of  Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry  out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation of these  specifications and Executive Order 11246, as amended.</p><p class="depth4">13. The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these  specifications, shall implement specific affirmative action steps, at  least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph 7 of these  specifications, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to  ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply  with the requirements of the Executive Order, the implementing  regulations, or these specifications, the Director shall proceed in  accordance with 41 CFR 60-4.8.</p><p class="depth4">14. The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor  all employment related activity to ensure that the company EEO policy is  being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof  as may be required by the Government and to keep records. Records shall  at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone numbers,  construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification  number when assigned, social security number, race, sex, status (e.g.,  mechanic, apprentice trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in  status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and  locations at which the work was performed. Records shall be maintained  in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree  that existing records satisfy this requirement, contractors shall not be  required to maintain separate records.</p><p class="depth4">15. Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon  the application of other laws which establish different standards of  compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of  local or other area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works  Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant  Program).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notice set forth in 41 CFR 60-4.2 and the specifications set  forth in 41 CFR 60-4.3 replace the New Form for Federal Equal Employment  Opportunity Bid Conditions for Federal and Federally Assisted  Construction published at 41 FR 32482 and commonly known as the Model  Federal EEO Bid Conditions, and the New Form shall not be used after the  regulations in 41 CFR part 60-4 become effective.  [43 FR 49254, Oct. 20, 1978; 43 FR 51401, Nov. 3, 1978, as amended at 45  FR 65978, Oct. 3, 1980; 79 FR 72995, Dec. 9, 2014]</p>
