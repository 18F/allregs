                            <p class="depth0">Acceptable quality level (AQL) as used in this subpart means the  minimum percent of deliverables which are compliant with a given  performance standard that would permit a contractor to become eligible  for an award term incentive. Because the performance necessary for  eligibility for the award term incentive may be in excess of that  necessary for the Government acceptance of contract deliverables, the  AQLs associated with the award term incentive may exceed the AQLs  associated with the acceptance of contract deliverables. For example,  under contract X, acceptable performance is 75 percent of reports  submitted to the Government within five days. However, to be eligible  for an award term incentive, 85 percent of reports must be submitted to  the Government within five days.  [73 FR 1980, Jan. 11, 2008]</p>
