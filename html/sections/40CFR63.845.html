                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The provisions in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section shall apply to any Soderberg, CWPB2, and CWPB3 potline that adds a new potroom group to an existing potline or that is associated with a potroom group that meets the definition of ``modified potroom group'' or ``reconstructed potroom group.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following shall not, by themselves, be considered to result in a potroom group modification:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance, repair, and replacement that the applicable regulatory authority determines to be routine for the potroom group;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An increase in production rate of an existing potroom group, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that potroom group;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An increase in the hours of operation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to the effective date of this subpart, the existing potroom group was designed to accommodate that alternative use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is the reduction of air pollutants, except when an emission control system is removed or is replaced by a system that the applicable regulatory authority determines to be less environmentally beneficial; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The relocation or change in ownership of an existing potroom group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iv) of this section apply when the applicable regulatory authority must determine if a potroom group meets the definition of reconstructed potroom group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Fixed capital cost'' means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an owner or operator of an existing potroom group proposes to replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new potroom group, he/she shall notify the applicable regulatory authority of the proposed replacements. The notice must be postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of the replacements is commenced and must include the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Name and address of the owner or operator;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The location of the existing potroom group;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A brief description of the existing potroom group and the components that are to be replaced;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A description of the existing air pollution control equipment and the proposed air pollution control equipment;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new potroom group;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The estimated life of the existing potroom group after the replacements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the potroom group may have in complying with the applicable standards of performance after the proposed replacements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicable regulatory authority will determine, within 30 days of the receipt of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and any additional information he/she may reasonably require, whether the proposed replacement constitutes a reconstructed potroom group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The applicable regulatory authority's determination under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall be based on:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new potroom group;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The estimated life of the potroom group after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new potroom group;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the potroom group; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with applicable standards of performance that are inherent in the proposed replacements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lower TF emission limit. The owner or operator shall calculate a lower TF emission limit for any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group using the following equation:
L1 = f1xLPG1+(1-f1)xLPL
Where:
L1 = the lower TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton);f1 = the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production</p><p class="depth2">capacity that is contained within all modified potroom groups,</p><p class="depth2">reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;LPG1 = 0.95 kg/Mg (1.9 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.0</p><p class="depth2">kg/Mg (2.0 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines; andLPL = the TF emission limit from Sec.  63.843(a)(1) for the</p><p class="depth2">appropriate potline subcategory that would have otherwise</p><p class="depth2">applied to the potline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upper TF emission limit. The owner or operator shall calculate an upper TF emission limit for any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group using the following equation:
L2 = f1xLPG2+(1-f1)xLPL
Where:
L2 = the upper TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton); andLPG2 = 1.25 kg/Mg (2.5 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.3</p><p class="depth2">kg/Mg (2.6 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recalculation. The TF emission limits in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be recalculated each time a new potroom group is added to the potline and each time an additional potroom group meets the definition of ``modified potroom group'' or ``reconstructed potroom group.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emission limitation. The owner or operator shall not discharge or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere emissions of TF from any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group that exceed the lower emission limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, except that emissions less than the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section will be considered in compliance if the owner or operator demonstrates that exemplary operation and maintenance procedures were used with respect to the emission control system and that proper control equipment was operating at the potline during the performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Report. Within 30 days of any performance test that reveals emissions that fall between the lower limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section and the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit to the applicable regulatory authority a report indicating whether all necessary control devices were online and operating properly during the performance test, describing the operating and maintenance procedures followed, and setting forth any explanation for the excess emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procedures to determine TF emissions. The owner or operator shall determine TF emissions for the potline using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from sampling secondary emissions and the primary control system for all new potroom groups, modified potroom groups, and reconstructed potroom groups using the procedures, equations, and test methods in Sec. Sec.  63.847, 63.848, and 63.849.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from sampling secondary emissions and the primary control system for potroom groups or sections of potroom groups within the potline that are not new potroom groups, modified potroom groups, or reconstructed potroom groups according to paragraphs (g)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the mass emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from at least one potroom group within the potline that is not a new potroom group, modified potroom group, or reconstructed potroom group using the procedures, equations, and test methods in Sec. Sec.  63.847, 63.848, and 63.849, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the results of the testing required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section to represent the entire potline based on a demonstration that the results are representative of the entire potline. Representativeness shall be based on showing that all of the potroom groups associated with the potline are substantially equivalent in terms of their structure, operability, type of emissions, volume of emissions, and concentration of emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the TF emissions for the potline in kg/Mg (lb/ton) based on the production-weighted average of the TF emission rates from paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section using the following equation:
E=f1xEPG1+(1-f1)xEPL
where:
E=the TF emission rate for the entire potline, kg/Mg (lb/ton);f1 = the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production</p><p class="depth3">rate that is contained within all modified potroom groups,</p><p class="depth3">reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;EPG1 = the TF emission rate from paragraph (g)(1) of this</p><p class="depth3">section for all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom</p><p class="depth3">groups, and new potroom groups, kg/Mg (lb/ton); andEPL = the TF emission rate for the balance of the potline</p><p class="depth3">from paragraph (g)(2) of this section, kg/Mg (lb/ton).</p><p class="depth3">Compliance is demonstrated when TF emissions for the potline meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an alternative to sampling as required in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may perform representative sampling of the entire potline subject to the approval of the applicable regulatory authority. Such sampling shall provide coverage by the sampling equipment of both the new, modified, or reconstructed potroom group and the balance of the potline. The coverage for the new, modified, or reconstructed potroom group must meet the criteria specified in the reference methods in Sec.  63.849. TF emissions shall be determined for the potline using the procedures, equations, and test methods in Sec. Sec.  63.847, 63.848, and 63.849. Compliance is demonstrated when TF emissions for the potline meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Opacity. Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall not discharge or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group any emissions of gases that exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Alternative opacity limit. An alternative opacity limit may be established in place of the opacity limit in paragraph (h) of this section using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the regulatory authority finds that a potline is in compliance with the applicable TF standard for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with the methods and procedures in Sec.  63.849 but during the time such performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, the regulatory authority shall notify and advise the owner or operator that he/she may petition the regulatory authority within 10 days of receipt of notification to

make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulatory authority will grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the regulatory authority; and that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As indicated by the performance and opacity tests, the regulatory authority will establish an opacity standard for any potroom group meeting the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section such that the opacity standard could be met by the potroom group at all times during which the potline is meeting the TF emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The alternative opacity limit established in paragraph (i)(3) of this section shall not be greater than 20 percent opacity.</p>
