                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a filing fee based on a bona fide estimate of the maximum offering price, computed in accordance with this rule where applicable, has been paid, no additional filing fee shall be required as a result of changes in the

proposed offering price. If the number of shares or other units of securities, or the principal amount of debt securities to be offered is increased by an amendment filed prior to the effective date of the registration statement, an additional filing fee, computed on the basis of the offering price of the additional securities, shall be paid. There will be no refund once the statement is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A required fee shall be reduced in an amount equal to any fee paid with respect to such transaction pursuant to sections 13(e) and 14(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any applicable provision of this section; the fee requirements under sections 13(e) and 14(g) shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fee paid the Commission with respect to a transaction under this section. No part of a filing fee is refundable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where securities are to be offered at prices computed upon the basis of fluctuating market prices, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, as follows: either the average of the high and low prices reported in the consolidated reporting system (for exchange traded securities and last sale reported over-the-counter securities) or the average of the bid and asked price (for other over-the-counter securities) as of a specified date within 5 business days prior to the date of filing the registration statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where securities are to be offered at varying prices based upon fluctuating values of underlying assets, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the market value of such assets as of a specified date within fifteen days prior to the date of filing, in accordance with the method to be used in calculating the daily offering price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where securities are to be offered to existing security holders and the portion, if any, not taken by such security holders is to be reoffered to the general public, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the proposed offering price to such security holders or the proposed reoffering price to the general public, whichever is higher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where securities are to be offered in exchange for other securities (except where such exchange results from the exercise of a conversion privilege) or in a reclassification or recapitalization which involves the substitution of a security for another security, a merger, a consolidation, or a similar plan of acquisition, the registration fee is to be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the basis of the market value of the securities to be received by the registrant or canceled in the exchange or transaction as established by the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is no market for the securities to be received by the registrant or cancelled in the exchange or transaction, the book value of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of filing the registration statement shall be used, unless the issuer of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership, or has an accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If any cash is to be received by the registrant in connection with the exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be added to the value of the securities to be received by the registrant or cancelled as computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section. If any cash is to be paid by the registrant in connection with the exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be deducted from the value of the securities to be received by the registrant in exchange as computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Securities to be offered directly or indirectly for certificates of deposit shall be deemed to be offered for the securities represented by the certificates of deposit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a filing fee is paid under this paragraph for the registration of an offering and the registration statement also covers the resale of such securities, no additional filing fee is required to be paid for the resale transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Where securities are to be offered pursuant to warrants or other rights to purchase such securities and the holders of such warrants or rights may be deemed to be underwriters, as defined

in section 2(11) of the Act, with respect to the warrants or rights or the securities subject thereto, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the price at which the warrants or rights or securities subject thereto are to be offered to the public. If such offering price cannot be determined at the time of filing the registration statement, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the highest of the following: (1) the price at which the warrants or rights may be exercised, if known at the time of filing the registration statement; (2) the offering price of securities of the same class included in the registration statement; or (3) the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the price at which the warrants or rights may be exercised and they are exercisable over a period of time at progressively higher prices, the fee shall be calculated on the basis of the highest price at which they may be exercised. If the warrants or rights are to be registered for distribution in the same registration statement as the securities to be offered pursuant thereto, no separate registration fee shall be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan, the aggregate offering price and the amount of the registration fee shall be computed with respect to the maximum number of the registrant's securities issuable under the plan that are covered by the registration statement. If the offering price is not known, the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of an employee stock option plan, the aggregate offering price and the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price at which the options may be exercised, or, if such price is not known, upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If there is no market for the securities to be offered, the book value of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of filing the registration statement shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan, the aggregate offering price and the amount of the registration fee shall be computed with respect to the maximum number of the registrant's securities issuable under the plan that are covered by the registration statement. If the offering price is not known, the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of an employee stock option plan, the aggregate offering price and the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price at which the options may be exercised, or, if such price is not known, upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If there is no market for the securities to be offered, the book value of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of filing the registration statement shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the registration statement registers securities of the registrant and also registers interests in the plan constituting separate securities, no separate fee is required with respect to the plan interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a registration statement includes securities to be offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan and covers the resale of the same securities, no additional filing fee shall be paid with respect to the securities to be offered for resale. A filing fee determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall be paid with respect to any additional securities to be offered for resale.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where convertible securities and the securities into which conversion is offered are registered at the same time, the registration fee is to be calculated on the basis of the proposed offering price of the convertible securities alone, except that if any additional consideration is to be received in connection with the exercise of the conversion privilege the maximum amount which may be received shall be added to the proposed offering price of the convertible securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Where securities are sold prior to the registration thereof and are subsequently registered for the purpose of making an offer of rescission of such sale or sales, the registration fee is to be calculated on the basis of the amount at which such securities were sold, except that where securities repurchased pursuant to such offer of rescission are to be reoffered to the general public at a price in excess of such amount the registration fee is to be calculated on the basis of the proposed reoffering price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of Depositary Shares evidenced by American Depositary Receipts shall, only for the purpose of calculating the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the maximum aggregate fees or charges to be imposed in connection with the issuance of such receipts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of any

put or call option which is traded on an exchange and registered by such exchange or a facility thereof or which is traded over the counter shall, for the purpose of calculating the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the maximum aggregate fees or charges to be imposed by such registrant in connection with the issuance of such option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, where the securities to be registered include (1) any note, draft, bill of exchange, or bankers' acceptance which meets all the conditions of section 3(a)(3) hereof, and (2) any note, draft, bill of exchange or bankers' acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity date of which is likewise limited, but which otherwise does not meet the conditions of section 3(a)(3), the registration fee shall be calculated by taking one-fiftieth of 1 per centum of the maximum principal amount of only those securities not meeting the conditions of section 3(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Where the securities to be offered are guarantees of other securities which are being registered concurrently, no separate fee for the guarantees shall be payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Where an issuer registers an offering of securities, the registration fee may be calculated on the basis of the maximum aggregate offering price of all the securities listed in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table. The number of shares or units of securities need not be included in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' Table. If the maximum aggregate offering price increases prior to the effective date of the registration statement, a pre-effective amendment must be filed to increase the maximum dollar value being registered and the additional filing fee shall be paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Where all or a portion of the securities offered under a registration statement remain unsold after the offering's completion or termination, or withdrawal of the registration statement, the aggregate total dollar amount of the filing fee associated with those unsold securities (whether computed under Sec. 230.457(a) or (o)) may be offset against the total filing fee due for a subsequent registration statement or registration statements. The subsequent registration statement(s) must be filed within five years of the initial filing date of the earlier registration statement, and must be filed by the same registrant (including a successor within the meaning of Sec. 230.405), a majority-owned subsidiary of that registrant, or a parent that owns more than 50 percent of the registrant's outstanding voting securities. A note should be added to the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the subsequent registration statement(s) stating the dollar amount of the filing fee previously paid that is offset against the currently due filing fee, the file number of the earlier registration statement from which the filing fee is offset, and the name of the registrant and the initial filing date of that earlier registration statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no filing fee is required for the registration of an indeterminate amount of securities to be offered solely for market-making purposes by an affiliate of the registrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement, the registration fee is to be calculated in accordance with this section. When the issuer elects to defer payment of the fees pursuant to Rule 456(b) (Sec. 230.456(b)), the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the registration statement must indicate that the issuer is relying on Rule 456(b) but does not need to include the number of shares or units of securities or the maximum aggregate offering price of any securities until the issuer updates the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table to reflect payment of the registration fee, including a pay-as-you-go registration fee in accordance with Rule 456(b). The registration fee shall be calculated based on the fee payment rate in effect on the date of the fee payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Where securities are asset-backed securities being offered pursuant to a registration statement on Form SF-3 (Sec. 239.45 of this chapter), the registration fee is to be calculated in accordance with this section. When the issuer

elects to defer payment of the fees pursuant to Sec. 230.456(c), the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the registration statement must indicate that the issuer is relying on Sec. 230.456(c) but does not need to include the number of units of securities or the maximum aggregate offering price of any securities until the issuer updates the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table to reflect payment of the registration fee, including a pay-as-you-go registration fee in accordance with Sec. 230.456(c). The registration fee shall be calculated based on the fee payment rate in effect on the date of the fee payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Where the security to be offered is a collateral certificate or is a special unit of beneficial interest, underlying asset-backed securities (as defined in Sec. 229.1101(c) of this chapter) which are being registered concurrently, no separate fee for the certificate or the special unit of beneficial interest shall be payable.
