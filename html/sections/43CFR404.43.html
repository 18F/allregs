Reclamation standards and requirements for the content  of an appraisal investigation are available at your local Reclamation  office. Reclamation will notify you in writing of the outcome of this  determination within 90 business days from the date of Reclamation's  receipt of the appraisal investigation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the appraisal investigation does not include the required  information, you will be notified in writing of the reasons why, and you  will have an opportunity to make changes and re-submit the corrected  appraisal investigation to Reclamation for additional review. As  appropriate, Reclamation will work with you to suggest approaches to  correct the appraisal investigation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once Reclamation determines that the appraisal investigation  includes all of the required information, Reclamation will review the  investigation to determine, based on an application of the criteria set  forth in Sec. 404.44, whether or not it is appropriate to proceed to a  feasibility study. Reclamation will document its findings in an  appraisal report, as described in Sec. 404.45;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reclamation's review of an appraisal investigation will take no  longer than 180 business days from its receipt of the appraisal  investigation to its completion of the appraisal report, excluding time  when Reclamation is waiting for additional information from the project  sponsor.</p>
