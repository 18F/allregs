Each issuing agent shall comply with all regulations and instructions issued by the Department of the Treasury directly, or through the designated Federal Reserve Bank, concerning the sale, inscription, dating, and validation of bonds; the acceptance, processing, and transmittal of over-the-counter purchase orders; the remittance of sales proceeds; and the disposition of paper and electronic registration records. No issuing agent shall have authority to sell bonds other than as provided in the offering circular.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees. Each issuing agent, other than a Federal agency, will be paid fees. Only issuing agents are eligible to collect fees. With prior approval, agents that are authorized to inscribe bonds and receive fee payments will also be paid a bonus for presorting savings bond mailings. Schedules reflecting the amount of the fees and presort bonuses, and the basis on which they are computed and paid, will be published separately in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No charge to customers. Any issuing agent that accepts fees from the Department of the Treasury for selling savings bonds, and/or accepting over-the-counter purchase orders, shall not make any charge to customers for the same service.
