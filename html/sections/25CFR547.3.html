                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minimum standards. These are minimum standards and a TGRA may establish and implement additional technical standards that do not conflict with the standards set out in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No limitation of technology. This part should not be interpreted to limit the use of technology or to preclude the use of technology not specifically referenced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only applicable standards apply. Gaming equipment and software must meet all applicable requirements of this part. For example, if a Class II gaming system lacks the ability to print or accept vouchers, then any standards that govern vouchers do not apply. These standards do not apply to associated equipment such as voucher and kiosk systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State jurisdiction. Nothing in this part should be construed to grant to a state jurisdiction over Class II gaming or to extend a state's jurisdiction over Class III gaming.</p>
