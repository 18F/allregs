                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In order to satisfy the requirements of effectiveness  under Sec. 1956.10 (c)(1) and (d)(1), the State plan for public  employees shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establish the same standards, procedures, criteria, and rules as  have been established by the Assistant Secretary under the act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish alternative standards, procedures, criteria, and rules  which will be measured against each of the indices of effectiveness in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to determine whether the  alternatives are at least as effective as the Federal program for  private employees, where applicable, with respect to the subject of each  index. For each index the State must demonstrate by the presentation of  factual or other appropriate information that its plan for public  employees will, to the extent practicable, be at least as effective as  the Federal program for private employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The indices for measurement of a State plan for  public employees with regard to standards follow in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section. The Assistant Secretary will determine whether the State  plan for public employees satisfies the requirements of effectiveness  with regard to each index as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assistant Secretary will determine whether the State plan  for public employees:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides for State standards which are or will be at least as  effective as the standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. In  the case of any State standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful  physical agents, they should adequately assure,   to the extent feasible, that no employee will suffer material impairment  of health or functional capacity, even if such employee has regular  exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his  working life, by such means as, in the development and promulgation of  standards, obtaining the best available evidence through research,  demonstration, experiments, and experience under this and any other  safety and health laws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provides an adequate method to assure that its standards will  continue to be at least as effective as Federal standards, including  Federal standards which become effective subsequent to any approval of  the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provides a procedure for the development and promulgation of  standards which allows for the consideration of pertinent factual  information and affords interested persons, including employees,  employers and the public, an opportunity to participate in such  processes, by such means as establishing procedures for consideration of  expert technical knowledge, and providing interested persons, including  employers, employees, recognized standards-producing organizations, and  the public, an opportunity to submit information requesting the  development or promulgation of new standards or the modification or  revocation of existing standards and to participate in any hearings.  This index may also be satisfied by such means as the adoption of  Federal standards, in which case the procedures at the Federal level  before adoption of a standard under section 6 may be considered to meet  the conditions of this index.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provides authority for the granting of variances from State  standards upon application of a public employer or employers which  correspond to variances authorized under the Act, and for consideration  of the views of interested parties, by such means as giving affected  employees notice of each application and an opportunity to request and  participate in hearings or other appropriate proceedings relating to  applications for variances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provides for prompt and effective standards setting actions for  the protection of employees against new and unforeseen hazards, by such  means as the authority to promulgate emergency temporary standards. Such  authority is particularly appropriate for those situations where public  employees are exposed to unique hazards for which existing standards do  not provide adequate protection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provides that State standards contain appropriate provision for  the furnishing to employees of information regarding hazards in the  workplace, including information about suitable precautions, relevant  symptoms, and emergency treatment in case of exposure; by such means as  labelling, posting, and, where appropriate, results of medical  examinations, being furnished only to appropriate State officials and,  if the employee so requests, to his physician.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Provides that State standards where appropriate, contain  specific provision for the protection of employees from exposure to  hazards, by such means as containing appropriate provision for the use  of suitable protective equipment and for control or technological  procedures with respect to such hazards, including monitoring or  measuring such exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The indices for measurement of a State plan for  public employees with regard to enforcement follow in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section. The Assistant Secretary will determine whether the plan  satisfies the requirements of effectiveness with regard to each index as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assistant Secretary will determine whether the State plan  for public employees:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides for inspection of covered workplaces in the State by  the designated agency or agencies or any other agency which is duly  delegated authority, including inspections in response to complaints  where there are reasonable grounds to believe a hazard exists, in order  to assure, so far as possible, safe and healthful working conditions for  covered employees by such means as providing for inspections under  conditions such as those provided in section 8 of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provides an opportunity for employees and their representative,  before, during, and after inspections, to   bring possible violations to the attention of the State or local agency  with enforcement responsibility in order to aid inspections, by such  means as affording a representative of the employer, and a  representative authorized by employees, an opportunity to accompany the  inspector during the physical inspection of the workplace, or where  there is no authorized representative, provide for consultation by the  inspector with a reasonable number of employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provides for notification of employees, or their  representatives, when the State decides not to take compliance action as  a result of violations alleged by such employees or their  representative, and further provides for informal review of such  decisions, by such means as written notification of decisions not to  take compliance action and the reasons therefor, and procedures for  informal review of such decisions and written statements of the  disposition of such review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provides that public employees be informed of their protections  and obligations under the Act, including the provisions of applicable  standards, by such means as the posting of notices or other appropriate  sources of information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provides necessary and appropriate protection to an employee  against discharge or discrimination in terms and conditions of  employment because he has filed a complaint, testified, or otherwise  acted to exercise rights under the State program for public employees  for himself or others, by such means as providing for appropriate  sanctions against the State or local agency for such actions, and by  providing for the withholding, upon request, of the names of  complainants from the employer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provides that public employees have access to information on  their exposure to toxic materials or harmful physical agents and receive  prompt information when they have been or are being exposed to such  materials or agents in concentrations or at levels in excess of those  prescribed by the applicable safety and health standards, by such means  as the observation by employees of the monitoring or measuring of such  materials or agents, employee access to the records of such monitoring  or measuring, prompt notification by a public employer to any employee  who has been or is being exposed to such agents or materials in excess  of the applicable standards, and information to such employee of  corrective action being taken.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Provides procedures for the prompt restraint or elimination of  any conditions or practices in covered places of employment which could  reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm  immediately or before the imminence of such danger can be eliminated  through the enforcement procedures otherwise provided for in the plan,  by such means as immediately informing employees and employers of such  hazards, taking steps to obtain immediate abatement of the hazard by the  employer, and, where appropriate, authority to initiate necessary legal  proceedings to require such abatement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Provides that the designated agency (or agencies) and any  agency to which it has duly delegated authority, will have the necessary  legal authority for the enforcement of standards by such means as  provisions for appropriate compulsory process to obtain necessary  evidence or testimony in connection with inspection and enforcement  proceedings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Provides for prompt notice to public employers and employees  when an alleged violation of standards has occurred, including the  proposed abatement requirements, by such means as the issuance of a  written citation to the public employer and posting of the citation at  or near the site of the violation; further provides for advising the  public employer of any proposed sanctions, wherever appropriate, by such  means as a notice to the employer by certified mail within a reasonable  time of any proposed sanctions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Provides effective sanctions against public employers who  violate State standards and orders, or applicable public agency  standards, such as those prescribed in the Act. In lieu of monetary  penalties a complex of enforcement tools and rights, such as various  forms of equitable remedies   available to the designee including administrative orders; availability  of employee rights such as right to contest citations, and provisions  for strengthened employee participation in enforcement may be  demonstrated to be as effective as monetary penalties in achieving  complianace in public employment. In evaluating the effectiveness of an  alternate system for compelling compliance, elements of the enforcement  educational program such as a system of agency self inspection  procedures, and in-house training programs, and employee complaint  procedures may be taken into consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Provides for an employer to have the right of review of  violations alleged by the State or any agency to which it has duly  delegated authority, abatement periods and proposed penalties, where  appropriate, for employees or their representatives to challenge the  reasonableness of the period of time fixed in the citation for the  abatement of the hazard, and for employees or their representatives to  have an opportunity to participate in review, proceedings, by such means  as providing for admininistrative review, with an opportunity for a full  hearing on the issues.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Provides that the State will undertake programs to encourage  voluntary compliance by public employers and employees by such means as  conducting training and consultation with such employers and employees,  and encouraging agency self-inspection programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional indices. Upon his own motion, or after consideration  of data, views, and arguments received in any proceedings held under  subpart C of this part, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe additional  indices for any State plan for public employees which shall be in  furtherance of the purpose of this section.</p>
