                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the procedure for handling construction defect complaints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each borrower who complains about construction defects will be requested to make a written complaint using a format specified by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). All known defects will be listed. An oral complaint may be accepted if making a written complaint will impose a hardship on the borrower. If an oral complaint is made, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify the contractor on behalf of the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The borrower will be informed that if, after 30 calendar days, the defects have not been corrected or other satisfactory arrangements made by the contractor, the borrower should notify FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 using a format specified by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will advise the contractor in writing of the borrower's complaint, the time and date of planned inspection by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel, and request that the contractor accompany the inspector and borrower on a joint inspection of the property in an attempt to resolve the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, prior to the planned inspection, the contractor informs FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that the alleged defect(s) has been or will be corrected within 30 calendar days, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the case is not resolved as outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify the borrower, contractor and manufacturer, if applicable, in writing of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's findings and who has been determined responsible for correcting the defect(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the defects are determined to be covered under the contractor's warranty, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will advise the contractor that the repairs must be completed within 30 calendar days or other time period agreed to by the borrower, the contractor, and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will further advise the contractor and/or manufacturer that if the defect(s) are not corrected, the Government will consider compensating the borrower for the costs of correcting the defect(s). In such a case, the contractor and/or manufacturer may be liable for costs paid by the Government and may be subject to suspension and/or debarment pursuant to subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Even if the manufacturer is determined to be solely responsible for the defect, the contractor will still be held liable for correction of the defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Should a contractor refuse to correct a defect after being officially requested in writing to do so, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will promptly institute formal suspension and debarment proceedings against the contractor (as a company and as individual(s)) in accordance with subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). The contractor's failure to reply to official correspondence or inability to correct a defect constitutes noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the contractor is willing to correct legitimate defects but the borrower refuses to permit this, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will document the facts in the borrower's case file. If the borrower chooses to file a claim for compensation for these defects, the circumstances of the borrower's refusal will be reviewed and may be sufficient grounds for disapproval of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)-(h)</em> [Reserved]</p>
