                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Format. Applications from the states for criminal justice block  grants must be submitted on Standard Form 424, Application for Federal  Assistance, at a time specified by the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The  Bureau will provide to the states an ``Application Kit'' that includes  SF 424, a list of assurances that the applicant must agree to, a table  of fund allocations, and additional guidance on how to prepare and  submit an application for criminal justice block grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Programs. Applications must set forth programs and projects  covering a two-year period which meet the purposes and criteria of  section 403(a) of the Justice Assistance Act and these regulations.  Applications must be amended annually, if new programs or projects are  to be added or if the programs or projects contained in the approved  application are not implemented. The application must designate which  statutory purpose the program or project is intended to achieve,  identify the state agency or unit of local government that will  implement the program or project, and provide the estimated funding  level for the program or project including the amount and source of cash  matching funds. Section 405 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 33.32 of the regulations identifies specific programs  which have been certified by the Bureau to meet the requirements of the  Act. Approval will be given for implementation of any of these programs,  if the applicant agrees to include all the critical elements in the  program design. An applicant need only identify the program, which  purpose it is intended to achieve, the state agency or unit of local  government which will implement it, the funding level (including amount  and source of match).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicants may request approval of programs other than one of  those certified by the Bureau. The application must contain, in addition  to the information in Sec.  33.41(b), a description of the program  (including its critical elements and performance indicators) and  evidence that it meets the criteria of offering a high probability of  improving the functions of the criminal justice system. Evidence may  include, but is not necessarily limited to, the results of any  evaluations of previous tests or demonstrations of the program concept.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicants may also request approval to expend up to 10 per  centum of their funds for programs which the Director of the Bureau of  Justice Assistance has established as priorities for discretionary  grants under section 503 of the Act, or which are innovative programs  that are deemed by the Director as likely to prove successful. For a  program the same as a discretionary program, the applicant may identify  it by name only and provide the information required under Sec.   33.41(b)(1) of the regulations. For an innovative program, the applicant  must describe the program (including its critical elements   and performance indicators) and provide evidence that it is likely to  prove successful.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Confidential information. Applications which request funds for  the STING Program should not state the location of the project. The  application should only include the program designation, the funds  involved, and the number of projects. The state agency or unit of local  government implementing the project will be made known to the Bureau of  Justice Assistance upon request or upon completion of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Audit requirement. Applications from the state must include the  date of the State Office's last audit and the anticipated date of the  next audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Civil rights contact. Applications from the state must include  the name of a civil rights contact person who has lead responsibility in  insuring that all applicable civil rights requirements are met and who  shall act as liaison in civil rights matters with the Office of Civil  Rights Compliance of the Office of Justice Programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application assurances. Applications must include the following  assurances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> An assurance that the applicant will comply, and all its  subgrantees and contractors will comply, with the non-discrimination  requirements of the Justice Assistance Act; title VI of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964; section 504 of   the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; title IX of the Education  Amendments of 1972; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; and the  Department of Justice Non-Discrimination regulations 28 CFR part 42,  subparts C, D, E, and G;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> An assurance that in the event a Federal or state court or  Federal or state administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination  after a due process hearing on the grounds of race, color, religion,  national orgin or sex against a recipient of funds, the recipient will  forward a copy of the finding to the Office of Civil Rights Compliance  (OCRC) of the Office of Justice Programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> An assurance that the applicant will require that every  recipient required to formulate an Equal Employment Opportunity Program  (EEOP) in accordance with 28 CFR 42.301 et. seq., submit a certification  to the state that it has a current EEOP on file which meets the  requirements herein;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> An assurance that the applicant will provide an EEOP, if  required to maintain one, where the application is for $500,000 or more  and provide the EEOP of any subgrantee of $500,000 or more;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> An assurance that the applicant will comply with the provisions  of the Office of Justice Programs ``Financial and Administrative Guide  for Grants,'' M 7100.1;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> An assurance that the applicant will comply with the provisions  of 28 CFR applicable to grants and cooperative agreements including part  18, Administrative Review Procedure; part 20, Criminal Justice  Information Systems; part 22, Confidentiality of Identifiable Research  and Statistical Information; part 23, Criminal Intelligence Systems  Operating Policies; part 30, Intergovernmental Review of Department of  Justice Programs and Activities; part 42; Non-discrimination Equal  Employment Opportunity Policies and Procedures; part 61, Procedures for  Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act; and part 63,  Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection Procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-participating State. If a state notifies the Bureau of  Justice Assistance of its intent not to apply for block grant funds or  fails to submit an application by the submission date, the Bureau will  announce the availability of the block grant funds to local units of  government in the non-participating state and will invite them to submit  applications directly to the Bureau. A unit of local government  receiving a block grant award directly from the Bureau assumes  responsibility for all activities which would normally be the  responsibility of the State Office.</p><p class="depth2">Additional Requirements</p>
