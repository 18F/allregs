                            <p class="depth0">Raisins means grapes of any variety grown in the area, from which a significant part of the natural moisture has been removed by sun-drying or artificial dehydration, either prior to or after such grapes have been removed from the vines. Removal of a significant part of the natural moisture means removal which has progressed to the point where the grape skin develops wrinkles characteristic of wrinkles in fully formed raisins.
