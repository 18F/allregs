                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Objectives. Each State agency shall ensure that project areas  operate the Food Stamp Program in accordance with the Act, regulations,  and FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. To ensure compliance with  program requirements, ME reviews shall be conducted to measure  compliance with the provisions of FNS regulations. The objectives of an  ME review are to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a systematic method of monitoring and assessing program  operations in the project areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide a basis for project areas to improve and strengthen  program operations by identifying and correcting deficiencies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a continuing flow of information between the project  areas, the States, and FNS, necessary to develop the solutions to  problems in program policy and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State agencies shall conduct a review  once every year for large project areas, once every two years for medium  project areas, and once every three years for small project areas,  unless an alternate schedule is approved by FNS. The most current and  accurate information on active monthly caseload available at the time  the review schedule is developed shall be used to determine project area  size.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for an alternate review schedule shall be submitted  for approval in writing with a proposed schedule and justification. In  any alternate schedule, each project area must be reviewed at least once  every three years. Approval of an alternate schedule is dependent upon a  State agency's justification that the project areas that will be  reviewed less frequently than required in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section are performing adequately and that previous reviews indicate few  problems or that known problems have been corrected. FNS retains the  authority for approving any alternate schedule and may approve a  schedule in whole or in part. Until FNS approval of an alternate  schedule is obtained, the State agency shall conduct reviews in  accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FNS may require the State agency to conduct additional on-site  reviews when a serious problem is detected in a project area which could  result in a substantial dollar or service loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State agencies shall also establish a system for monitoring  those project areas' operations which experience a significant influx of  migratory workers during such migrations. This requirement may be  satisfied by either scheduling ME reviews to coincide with such  migrations or by conducting special reviews. As part of the review the  State agency shall contact local migrant councils, advocate groups, or  other organizations in the project area to ensure that migrants are  receiving the required services.
