An agency may request from CMS an exception from this age requirement (within an outer limit of age 5) for a two year period and may request additional two year exceptions.

Sec.  431.17 and 431.18--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records and program manuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of its screening package under paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copies of rules and policies describing the methods used to assure that the informing requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section is met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Timeliness.
