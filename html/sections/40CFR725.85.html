                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claims applicable to the period prior to commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use--(1) When to make a claim. (i) A person who submits information to EPA under this part may assert a claim of confidentiality for portions of the specific microorganism identity at the time of submission of the information. This claim will apply only to the period prior to the commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When to make a claim. (i) A person who submits information to EPA under this part may assert a claim of confidentiality for portions of the specific microorganism identity at the time of submission of the information. This claim will apply only to the period prior to the commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person who submits information to EPA under this part may assert a claim of confidentiality for portions of the specific microorganism identity at the time of submission of the information. This claim will apply only to the period prior to the commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person who submits information to EPA under this part must reassert a claim of confidentiality and substantiate the claim each time the information is submitted to EPA. For example, if a person claims certain information confidential in a TERA submission and wishes the same information to remain confidential in a subsequent TERA or MCAN submission, the person must reassert and resubstantiate the claim in the subsequent submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assertion of claim. (i) A submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality only if the submitter believes that public disclosure prior to commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use of the fact that anyone is initiating research and development activities pertaining to the specific microorganism or intends to manufacture or import the specific microorganism for general commercial use would reveal confidential business information. Claims must be substantiated in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 725.94(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality only if the submitter believes that public disclosure prior to commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use of the fact that anyone is initiating research and development activities pertaining to the specific microorganism or intends to manufacture or import the specific microorganism for general commercial use would reveal confidential business information. Claims must be substantiated in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 725.94(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the submission includes a health and safety study concerning the microorganism and if the claim for confidentiality with respect to the specific identity is denied in accordance with Sec. 725.92(c), EPA will deny a claim asserted under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Development of generic name. Any person who asserts a claim of confidentiality for portions of the specific microorganism identity under this paragraph must provide one of the following items at the time the submission is filed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The generic name which was accepted by EPA in the prenotice consultation conducted under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One generic name that is only as generic as necessary to protect the confidential identity of the particular microorganism. The name should reveal the specific identity to the maximum extent possible. The generic name will be subject to EPA review and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determination by EPA. (i) Any person who intends to assert a claim of confidentiality for the specific identity of a new microorganism may seek a determination by EPA of an appropriate generic name for the microorganism before filing a submission. For this purpose, the person should submit to EPA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person who intends to assert a claim of confidentiality for the specific identity of a new microorganism may seek a determination by EPA of an appropriate generic name for the microorganism before filing a submission. For this purpose, the person should submit to EPA:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The specific identity of the microorganism.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A proposed generic name(s) which is only as generic as necessary to protect the confidential identity of the new microorganism. The name(s) should reveal the specific identity of the microorganism to the maximum extent possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 30 days, EPA will inform the submitter either that one of the proposed generic names is adequate or that none is adequate and further consultation is necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use of generic name. If a submitter claims microorganism identity as confidential under paragraph (a) of this section, and if the submitter complies with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, EPA will issue for publication in the Federal Register notice described in Sec. 725.40 the generic name proposed by the submitter or one agreed upon by EPA and the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims applicable to the period after commencement of manufacture or import

for general commercial use--(1) Maintaining claim. Any claim of confidentiality under paragraph (a) of this section is applicable only until the microorganism is manufactured or imported for general commercial use and becomes eligible for inclusion on the Inventory. To maintain the confidential status of the microorganism identity when the microorganism is added to the Inventory, a submitter must reassert the confidentiality claim and substantiate the claim in the notice of commencement of manufacture required under Sec. 725.190.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintaining claim. Any claim of confidentiality under paragraph (a) of this section is applicable only until the microorganism is manufactured or imported for general commercial use and becomes eligible for inclusion on the Inventory. To maintain the confidential status of the microorganism identity when the microorganism is added to the Inventory, a submitter must reassert the confidentiality claim and substantiate the claim in the notice of commencement of manufacture required under Sec. 725.190.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A submitter may not claim the microorganism identity confidential for the period after commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use unless the submitter claimed the microorganism identity confidential under paragraph (a) of this section in the MCAN submitted for the microorganism.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A submitter may claim the microorganism identity confidential for the period after commencement of manufacture or import for general commercial use if the submitter did not claim the microorganism identity confidential under paragraph (a) of this section in any TERA submitted for the microorganism, but subsequently did claim microorganism identity confidential in the MCAN submitted for the microorganism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assertion of claim. (i) A person who believes that public disclosure of the fact that anyone manufactures or imports the microorganism for general commercial use would reveal confidential business information may assert a claim of confidentiality under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person who believes that public disclosure of the fact that anyone manufactures or imports the microorganism for general commercial use would reveal confidential business information may assert a claim of confidentiality under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the notice includes a health and safety study concerning the new microorganism, and if the claim for confidentiality with respect to the microorganism identity is denied in accordance with Sec. 725.92(c), EPA will deny a claim asserted under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requirements for assertion. Any person who asserts a confidentiality claim for microorganism identity must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section regarding submission of a generic name.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agree that EPA may disclose to a person with a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the microorganism the fact that the particular microorganism is included on the confidential Inventory for purposes of notification under section 5(a)(1)(A) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Have available and agree to furnish to EPA upon request the taxonomic designations and supplemental information required by Sec. 725.12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide a detailed written substantiation of the claim, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 725.94(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Denial of claim. If the submitter does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, EPA will deny the claim of confidentiality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acceptance of claim. (i) EPA will publish a generic name on the public Inventory if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will publish a generic name on the public Inventory if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The submitter asserts a claim of confidentiality in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> No claim for confidentiality of the microorganism identity as part of a health and safety study has been denied in accordance with part 2 of this title or Sec. 725.92.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Publication of a generic name on the public Inventory does not create a category for purposes of the Inventory. Any person who has a bona fide intent to manufacture or import a microorganism which is described by a generic name on the public Inventory may submit an inquiry to EPA under Sec. 725.15(b) to determine whether the particular microorganism is included on the confidential Inventory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon receipt of a request described in Sec. 725.15(b), EPA may require the submitter who originally asserted confidentiality for a microorganism to submit to EPA the information listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to submit any of the information required under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request by EPA under paragraph (b) of this section will constitute a waiver of the original submitter's confidentiality claim. In this event, EPA may place the specific microorganism identity on the public Inventory without further notice to the original submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Use of generic name on the public Inventory. If a submitter asserts a

claim of confidentiality under paragraph (b) of this section, EPA will examine the generic microorganism name proposed by the submitter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If EPA determines that the generic name proposed by the submitter is only as generic as necessary to protect the confidential identity of the particular microorganism, EPA will place that generic name on the public Inventory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If EPA determines that the generic name proposed by the submitter is more generic than necessary to protect the confidential identity, EPA will propose in writing, for review by the submitter, an alternative generic name that will reveal the identity of the microorganism to the maximum extent possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the generic name proposed by EPA is acceptable to the submitter, EPA will place that generic name on the public Inventory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the generic name proposed by EPA is not acceptable to the submitter, the submitter must explain in detail why disclosure of that generic name would reveal confidential business information and propose another generic name which is only as generic as necessary to protect the confidential identity of the microorganism. If EPA does not receive a response from the submitter within 30 days after the submitter receives the proposed name, EPA will place EPA's chosen generic name on the public Inventory. If the submitter does provide the information requested, EPA will review the response. If the submitter's proposed generic name is acceptable, EPA will publish that generic name on the public Inventory. If the submitter's proposed generic name is not acceptable, EPA will notify the submitter of EPA's choice of a generic name. Thirty days after this notification, EPA will place the chosen generic name on the public Inventory.</p>
