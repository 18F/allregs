                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Where an application for final settlement of an adjusted service  certificate is received in the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to  the maturity date of the certificate, payment will be made under the  terms of the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, 1936. This act provides  for payment of the amount due on the certificate, after deducting any  unpaid loans with interest through September 30, 1931, in adjusted  service bonds. These bonds will be issued by the Treasury Department in  denominations of $50, in the name of the veteran only, and will bear  interest at the rate of 3 percent per annum from June 15, 1936, to June  15, 1945. Any excess amount not sufficient to purchase a $50 bond will  be paid by check.  [19 FR 5087, Aug. 12, 1954]</p>
