                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Petition. To be classified by the Department of Energy as an accreditation body, an organization must submit a petition to the Department requesting such classification, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 431.21. The petition must demonstrate that the organization meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation criteria. To be classified as an accreditation body by the Department, the organization must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It must have satisfactory standards and procedures for conducting and administering an accreditation system and for granting accreditation. This must include provisions for periodic audits to verify that the laboratories receiving its accreditation continue to conform to the criteria by which they were initially accredited, and for withdrawal of accreditation where such conformance does not occur, including failure to provide accurate test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It must be independent of electric motor manufacturers, importers, distributors, private labelers or vendors. It cannot be affiliated with, have financial ties with, be controlled by, or be under common control with any such entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It must be qualified to perform the accrediting function in a highly competent manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It must be expert in the content and application of the test procedures

and methodologies in IEEE Std 112-2004 Test Method B or CSA C390-10, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Petition format. Each petition requesting classification as an accreditation body must contain a narrative statement as to why the organization meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, must be signed on behalf of the organization by an authorized representative, and must be accompanied by documentation that supports the narrative statement. The following provides additional guidance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standards and procedures. A copy of the organization's standards and procedures for operating an accreditation system and for granting accreditation should accompany the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Independent status. The petitioning organization should identify and describe any relationship, direct or indirect, that it has with an electric motor manufacturer, importer, distributor, private labeler, vendor, trade association or other such entity, as well as any other relationship it believes might appear to create a conflict of interest for it in performing as an accreditation body for electric motor testing laboratories. It should explain why it believes such relationship(s) would not compromise its independence as an accreditation body.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Qualifications to do accrediting. Experience in accrediting should be discussed and substantiated by supporting documents. Of particular relevance would be documentary evidence that establishes experience in the application of guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 58, Calibration and testing laboratory accreditation systems--General requirements for operation and recognition, as well as experience in overseeing compliance with the guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 25, General Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories (referenced for guidance only, see Sec. 431.14).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expertise in electric motor test procedures. The petition should set forth the organization's experience with the test procedures and methodologies in IEEE Std 112-2004 Test Method B and CSA C390-10, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15). This part of the petition should include items such as, but not limited to, a description of prior projects and qualifications of staff members. Of particular relevance would be documentary evidence that establishes experience in applying the guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 25, General Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories, (referenced for guidance only, see Sec. 431.14) to energy efficiency testing for electric motors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition. The Department will evaluate the petition in accordance with Sec. 431.21, and will determine whether the applicant meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section to be classified as an accrediting body.
