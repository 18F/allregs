                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General policy. The Commission will not review a ruling of the presiding officer prior to its consideration of the entire proceeding except in extraordinary circumstances. This section specifies the showing which participants must make in order to appeal interlocutory rulings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeals certified by the presiding officer. (1) Before the issuance of an initial decision pursuant to Sec. 3001.39(a) or the certification of the record to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 3001.38(a), rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed when the presiding officer certifies in writing that an interlocutory appeal is warranted. The presiding officer shall not certify an appeal unless the officer finds that (i) the ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and (ii) an immediate appeal from the ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the issuance of an initial decision pursuant to Sec. 3001.39(a) or the certification of the record to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 3001.38(a), rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed when the presiding officer certifies in writing that an interlocutory appeal is warranted. The presiding officer shall not certify an appeal unless the officer finds that (i) the ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and (ii) an immediate appeal from the ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for the presiding officer to certify an appeal shall be made within 5 days after the presiding officer's ruling has been issued. The request shall set forth with specificity the reasons that a participant believes that an appeal meets the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. Such requests shall also state in detail the legal, policy, and factual arguments supporting the participant's position that the ruling should be modified. If the appeal is from a ruling rejecting or excluding evidence, such request shall include a statement of the substance of the evidence which the participant contends would be adduced by the excluded evidence and the conclusions intended to be derived therefrom.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The presiding officer may request responsive pleadings from other participants prior to ruling upon the request to certify an appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals not certified by the presiding officer. If the presiding officer declines to certify an appeal, a participant who has requested certification may apply to the Commission for review within 10 days. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, its review of the application will be based on the record and pleadings filed before the presiding officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action by the Commission. (1) The Commission may dismiss an appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that (i) the objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's consideration of the entire proceeding or (ii) interlocutory review is otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission may dismiss an appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that (i) the objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's consideration of the entire proceeding or (ii) interlocutory review is otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the presiding officer has declined to certify an appeal, the Commission will not allow an application for review unless it determines (i) that the presiding officer should have certified the matter, (ii) that extraordinary circumstances exist, and (iii) that prompt Commission decision is necessary to prevent grave detriment to the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may issue an order accepting an interlocutory appeal within 15 days after the presiding officer certifies the appeal or a participant files an application for review. If the Commission fails to issue such an order, leave to appeal from the presiding officer's interlocutory ruling shall be deemed to be denied. If the Commission issues an order accepting an appeal, it may rule upon the merits of the appeal in that order or at a later time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of appeals. Unless the presiding officer or the Commission so orders, the certification of an appeal or the filing of an application for review shall not stay the proceeding or the effectiveness of any ruling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review at conclusion of proceeding. If an interlocutory appeal is not certified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, objection to the ruling may be raised on review of the presiding officer's intermediate decision, or, if the intermediate decision is omitted, in the participants' briefs in accordance with Sec. 3001.34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Form, filing, and service of documents. Requests for certification, applications for review, and any responses shall be in writing and shall be in conformity with Sec. Sec. 3001.10 and 3001.11. They shall be filed and served pursuant to Sec. Sec. 3001.9 and 3001.12.
