The procedures shall provide, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Product specifications that are designed to ensure that the juice is not adulterated under section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because it may be injurious to health or because it may have been processed under insanitary conditions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Affirmative steps to ensure that the products being offered for entry were processed under controls that meet the requirements of this part. These steps may include any of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Obtaining from the foreign processor the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan and prerequisite program of the standard operating procedure records required by this part that relate to the specific lot of food being offered for import;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Obtaining either a continuing or lot specific certificate from an appropriate foreign government inspection authority or competent third party certifying that the imported food has been processed in accordance with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Regularly inspecting the foreign processor's facilities to ensure that the imported food is being processed in accordance with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Maintaining on file a copy, in English, of the foreign processor's hazard analysis and HACCP plan, and a written guarantee from the foreign processor that the imported food is processed in accordance with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Periodically testing the imported food, and maintaining on file a copy, in English, of a written guarantee from the foreign processor that the imported food is processed in accordance with the requirements of this part; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Other such verification measures as appropriate that provide an equivalent level of assurance of compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Competent third party.
