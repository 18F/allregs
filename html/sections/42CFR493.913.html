                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of services offered by laboratories. In mycobacteriology,  there are five types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those that interpret acid-fast stains and refer specimen to  another laboratory appropriately certified in the subspecialty of  mycobacteriology;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those that interpret acid-fast stains, perform primary  inoculation, and refer cultures to another laboratory appropriately  certified in the subspecialty of mycobacteriology for identification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and perform  identification and/or antimycobacterial susceptibility of Mycobacterium  tuberculosis, but refer other mycobacteria species to another laboratory  appropriately certified in the subspecialty of mycobacteriology for  identification and/or susceptibility tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and identify all  mycobacteria to the extent required for correct clinical diagnosis, but  refer antimycobacterial susceptibility tests to another laboratory  appropriately certified in the subspecialty of mycobacteriology; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Those that interpret acid-fast stains, isolate and identify all  mycobacteria to the extent required for correct clinical diagnosis, and  perform antimycobacterial susceptibility tests on the organisms  isolated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for  proficiency testing for mycobacteriology, the annual program must  provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at  least two testing events per year. The samples may be provided through  mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, provided to HHS or its designee for  on-site testing events. For types of laboratories specified in  paragraphs (a)(1) and (a) (3) through (5) of this section, an annual  program must include samples that contain species that are  representative of the 5 major groups (complexes) of mycobacteria  encountered in human specimens. The specific mycobacteria included in  the samples may vary from year to year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An approved program must furnish HHS and its agents with a  description of samples that it plans to include in its annual program no  later than six months before each calendar year. At least 50 percent of  the samples must be mixtures of the principal mycobacteria and  appropriate normal flora. The program must include mycobacteria commonly  occurring in patient specimens and other important emerging mycobacteria  (as determined by HHS). The program determines the reportable isolates  and correct responses for antimycobacterial susceptibility for any  designated isolate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An approved program may vary over time. For example, the types  of mycobacteria that might be included in an approved program over time  are--  TB</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium bovis Group I</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium kansasii Group II</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium szulgai Group III</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium terrae Group IV</p><p class="depth3">Mycobacterium fortuitum</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For antimycobacterial susceptibility testing, the program must  provide at least one sample per testing event that includes  mycobacterium tuberculosis that has a predetermined pattern of  sensitivity or resistance to the common antimycobacterial agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For laboratories specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the  program must provide at least five samples per testing event that  includes challenges that are acid-fast and challenges which do not  contain acid-fast organisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The program determines the reportable mycobacteria to be  detected by acid-fast stain, for isolation and identification, and for  antimycobacterial susceptibility. To determine the accuracy of a  laboratory's response, the program must compare the laboratory's  response for each sample with the response that reflects agreement of  either 80 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 80 percent or  more of all participating laboratories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the  program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must interpret acid-fast  stains and isolate and identify the organisms to the same extent it  performs these procedures on patient specimens. A laboratory's  performance will be evaluated on the basis of the average of its scores  as determined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of  organisms in addition to the correctly identified principal organism(s),  the grading system must provide a means of deducting credit for  additional erroneous organisms reported. Therefore, the total number of  correct responses submitted by the laboratory divided by the number of  organisms present plus the number of incorrect organisms reported by the  laboratory must be multiplied by 100 to establish a score for each  sample in each testing event. For example, if a sample contained one  principal organism and the laboratory reported it correctly but reported  the presence of an additional organism, which was not present, the  sample grade would be  1 / (1 + 1) x 100 = 50 percent</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For antimycobacterial susceptibility testing, a laboratory must  indicate which drugs are routinely included in its test panel when  testing patient samples. A laboratory's performance will be evaluated  for only those antibiotics for which susceptibility testing is routinely  performed on patient specimens. A correct response for each antibiotic  will be determined as described in Sec. 493.913(c)(1). Grading is based  on the number of correct susceptibility responses reported by the  laboratory divided by the actual number of correct susceptibility  responses as determined by the program, multiplied by 100. For example,  if a laboratory offers susceptibility testing using three  antimycobacterial agents and the laboratory reports correct response for  two of the three antimycobacterial agents, the laboratory's grade would  be \2/3\ x 100 = 67 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The performance criterion for qualitative tests is the presence  or absence of acid-fast organisms. The score for acid-fast organism  detection is the number of correct responses divided by the number of  samples to be tested, multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The score for a testing event in mycobacteriology is the average  of the scores determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this  section based on the type of service offered by the laboratory.
