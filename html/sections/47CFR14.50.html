                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In any complaint proceeding, the Commission may, in its  discretion, direct the attorneys and/or the parties to appear before it  for a status conference. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, an  initial status conference shall take place, at the time and place  designated by the Commission staff, ten business days after the date the  answer is due to be filed. A status conference may include discussion  of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Simplification or narrowing of the issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The necessity for or desirability of additional pleadings or  evidentiary submissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties  as to any or all of the matters in controversy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Settlement of all or some of the matters in controversy by  agreement of the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether discovery is necessary and, if so, the scope, type and  schedule for such discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The schedule for the remainder of the case and the dates for any  further status conferences; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the  complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parties shall meet and confer prior to the initial status  conference to discuss:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Settlement prospects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Issues in dispute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Schedules for pleadings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts, and key  legal issues; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties shall submit a joint statement of all proposals agreed  to and disputes remaining as a result of such meeting to Commission  staff at least two business days prior to the scheduled initial status  conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the initial status conference referenced in  paragraph (a) of this section, any party may also request that a  conference be held at any time after the complaint has been filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During a status conference, the Commission staff may issue oral  rulings pertaining to a variety of interlocutory matters relevant to the  conduct of a formal complaint proceeding including, inter alia,  procedural matters, discovery, and the submission of briefs or other  evidentiary materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Parties may make, upon written notice to the Commission and all  attending parties at least three business days prior to the status  conference, an audio recording of the Commission staff's summary of its  oral rulings. Alternatively, upon agreement among all attending parties  and written notice to the Commission at least three business days prior  to the status conference, the parties may make an audio recording of, or  use a stenographer to transcribe, the oral presentations and exchanges  between and among the participating parties, insofar as such  communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission  staff, as well as the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings. A  complete transcript of any audio recording or stenographic transcription  shall be filed with the Commission as part of the record, pursuant to  the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The parties shall  make all necessary arrangements for the use of a stenographer and the  cost of transcription, absent agreement to the contrary, will be shared  equally by all parties that agree to make the record of the status  conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The parties in attendance, unless otherwise directed, shall  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a joint proposed order memorializing the oral rulings  made during the conference to the Commission by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time,  on the business day following the date of the status conference, or as  otherwise directed by Commission staff. In the event the   parties in attendance cannot reach agreement as to the rulings that were  made, the joint proposed order shall include the rulings on which the  parties agree, and each party's alternative proposed rulings for those  rulings on which they cannot agree. Commission staff will review and  make revisions, if necessary, prior to signing and filing the submission  as part of the record. The proposed order shall be submitted both as  hard copy and on computer disk in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 14.51(d) of this subpart; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section,  submit to the Commission by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on the third  business day following the status conference or as otherwise directed by  Commission staff either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A transcript of the audio recording of the Commission staff's  summary of its oral rulings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A transcript of the audio recording of the oral presentations  and exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as  such communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the  Commission staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral  rulings; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A stenographic transcript of the oral presentations and  exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as such  communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission  staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Status conferences will be scheduled by the Commission staff at  such time and place as it may designate to be conducted in person or by  telephone conference call.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable  notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver by  that party and will not preclude the Commission staff from conferring  with those parties and/or counsel present.</p>
