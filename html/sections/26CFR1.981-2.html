                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election for special treatment--(1) In general. For all open taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, for which an individual citizen of the United States meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 981(a)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such citizen and his nonresident alien spouse may make a joint election to have section 981(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section apply to their income which is treated as community income under the applicable community property laws of a foreign country or countries. However, if the conditions prescribed by section 981(d)(3) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph are met, the nonresident alien spouse is not required to join in the election and such citizen may make a separate election to have section 981(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section apply to such income for such taxable years. An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section shall apply to every open taxable year of such citizen and his nonresident alien spouse beginning before January 1, 1967, for which all the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 981(a)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are met. It is immaterial whether such open taxable year is a taxable year subject to the provisions of the 1954 Code, the 1939 Code, or any other internal revenue law in effect before the 1939 Code. An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section has no effect for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966. For the definition of ``open taxable year'' see section 981(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.981-3. If the citizen and his nonresident alien spouse have different taxable years, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-3. If one of the spouses is deceased, see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.981-3. An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section is binding and may not be revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section shall apply to every open taxable year of such citizen and his nonresident alien spouse beginning before January 1, 1967, for which all the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 981(a)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are met. It is immaterial whether such open taxable year is a taxable year subject to the provisions of the 1954 Code, the 1939 Code, or any other internal revenue law in effect before the 1939 Code. An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section has no effect for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966. For the definition of ``open taxable year'' see section 981(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.981-3.

An election under section 981(c)(1) and this section is binding and may not be revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements to be met. In order for the citizen of the United States to make an election under this section, whether required to be made jointly with his nonresident alien spouse or permitted to be made separately, it is required under section 981(c)(1) that, for each taxable year to which the election applies, the citizen making the election be (i) a citizen of the United States and (ii) married at the close of the taxable year to an individual who is (a) a nonresident alien during the entire taxable year and (b), in the case of any such taxable years subsequent to the first, the same nonresident alien individual to whom the citizen was married at the close of such first taxable year. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.981-1 apply to determine whether a U.S. citizen making an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section is married at the close of a taxable year to an individual who is a nonresident alien during the entire taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cases where joint election is not required. A nonresident alien spouse is not required to join in an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section if the Director of International Operations determines in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section would not affect the liability for Federal income tax of the nonresident alien spouse for any taxable year, whether beginning on, before, or after January 1, 1967, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the effect of the election on the liability of the nonresident alien spouse for Federal income tax for any such taxable year cannot be ascertained and that to deny the election to the U.S. citizen spouse would be inequitable and cause undue hardship to the U.S. citizen.
If in accordance with this subparagraph the nonresident alien spouse is not required to join in the election by the U.S. citizen, the provisions of section 981(d)(2) and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.981-3 shall not apply so as to extend the period for assessing deficiencies or filing a claim for credit or refund for any taxable year of the nonresident alien spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manner of electing. The election under section 981(c)(1) and this section shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of community income--(1) In general. Community income, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.981-1, for

any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967, to which an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section applies, and the deductions properly allocable to such income, shall be divided between the U.S. citizen and his nonresident alien spouse in accordance with the rules set forth in section 981(c)(2) and subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. The income shall be divided in such manner even though the nonresident alien spouse is not required, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to join in the election by the U.S. citizen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Community income, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.981-1, for

any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967, to which an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section applies, and the deductions properly allocable to such income, shall be divided between the U.S. citizen and his nonresident alien spouse in accordance with the rules set forth in section 981(c)(2) and subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. The income shall be divided in such manner even though the nonresident alien spouse is not required, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to join in the election by the U.S. citizen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Earned income, business income, partnership income, and income from separate property. All community income for any taxable year to which this paragraph applies which is treated as the income of one of the spouses in accordance with section 981(b)(1), (2), or (3) and paragraph (b)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of Sec. 1.981-1 shall be treated as the income of that spouse for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other community income. All community income for any taxable year to which this paragraph applies, other than income described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, shall be treated as the income of the spouse who, for such taxable year, has a greater amount of gross income than the other spouse, determined by adding to the amount of gross income which is treated as the gross income of that spouse in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the amount of the gross income for the taxable year which is treated as the separate income of that spouse under the community property laws of the foreign country having jurisdiction to determine the legal ownership of the income. If either spouse dies during a taxable year, the taxable year of the surviving spouse shall be treated as ending on the date of such death for the purpose of determining which spouse has the greater amount of gross income for such taxable year. Moreover, if the U.S. citizen and his nonresident alien spouse do not have the same taxable year, as defined in section 441(b) and the regulations thereunder, the periods for which the amounts of gross income are to be compared under this subparagraph are (i) the taxable year of the citizen and (ii) that period falling within the consecutive taxable years of the nonresident alien spouse which coincides with the period covered by such taxable year of the citizen. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner of making election--(1) In general. A citizen of the United States and his nonresident alien spouse or, if subparagraph (4) of this paragraph applies, such citizen alone may make an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section at any time on or after November 13, 1966, for each and every taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967, which on the date of the election, as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.981-3, is open within the meaning of section 981(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.981-3. The election shall be made by filing a return, an amended return, or a claim for refund, whichever is proper, for each taxable year to which the election applies and attaching thereto a statement that the election is being made and that the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section are met for each such taxable year. The statement must also show the information required by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and must, where applicable, be signed by both persons making the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.
