                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 1.981-3. If the citizen and his  nonresident alien spouse have different taxable years, see paragraph (c)  of Sec. 1.981-3. If one of the spouses is deceased, see paragraph (d) of  Sec. 1.981-3. An election under section 981(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and this section is  binding and may not be revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 1.981-1 apply  to determine whether a U.S. citizen making an election under section  981(c)(1) and this section is married at the close of a taxable year to  an individual who is a nonresident alien during the entire taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cases where joint election is not required. A nonresident alien  spouse is not required to join in an election under section 981(c)(1)  and this section if the Director of International Operations determines  in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That an election under section 981(c)(1) and this section would  not affect the liability for Federal income tax of the nonresident alien  spouse for any taxable year, whether beginning on, before, or after  January 1, 1967, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the effect of the election on the liability of the  nonresident alien spouse for Federal income tax for any such taxable  year cannot be ascertained and that to deny the election to the U.S.  citizen spouse would be inequitable and cause undue hardship to the U.S.  citizen.  If in accordance with this subparagraph the nonresident alien spouse is  not required to join in the election by the U.S. citizen, the provisions  of section 981(d)(2) and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.981-3 shall not apply  so as to extend the period for assessing deficiencies or filing a claim  for credit or refund for any taxable year of the nonresident alien  spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manner of electing. The election under section 981(c)(1) and  this section shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules set  forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of Sec. 1.981-1, for   any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1967, to which an election  under section 981(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and this section applies, and the deductions  properly allocable to such income, shall be divided between the U.S.  citizen and his nonresident alien spouse in accordance with the rules  set forth in section 981(c)(2) and subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this  paragraph. The income shall be divided in such manner even though the  nonresident alien spouse is not required, in accordance with paragraph  (a)(3) of this section, to join in the election by the U.S. citizen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3), (4), or (5) of Sec. 1.981-1 shall be treated as  the income of that spouse for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other community income. All community income for any taxable  year to which this paragraph applies, other than income described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, shall be treated as the income of  the spouse who, for such taxable year, has a greater amount of gross  income than the other spouse, determined by adding to the amount of  gross income which is treated as the gross income of that spouse in  accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the amount of the  gross income for the taxable year which is treated as the separate  income of that spouse under the community property laws of the foreign  country having jurisdiction to determine the legal ownership of the  income. If either spouse dies during a taxable year, the taxable year of  the surviving spouse shall be treated as ending on the date of such  death for the purpose of determining which spouse has the greater amount  of gross income for such taxable year. Moreover, if the U.S. citizen and  his nonresident alien spouse do not have the same taxable year, as  defined in section 441(b) and the regulations thereunder, the periods  for which the amounts of gross income are to be compared under this  subparagraph are (i) the taxable year of the citizen and (ii) that  period falling within the consecutive taxable years of the nonresident  alien spouse which coincides with the period covered by such taxable  year of the citizen. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and this section at any time on or after  November 13, 1966, for each and every taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1967, which on the date of the election, as defined in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.981-3, is open within the meaning of section  981(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.981-3. The election shall be made  by filing a return, an amended return, or a claim for refund, whichever  is proper, for each taxable year to which the election applies and  attaching thereto a statement that the election is being made and that  the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section are met for each  such taxable year. The statement must also show the information required  by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and must, where applicable, be  signed by both persons making the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information required. The statement described in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph must show--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and account number, if any, of each spouse,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the executor, administrator, or other  person making the election for a deceased spouse,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The taxable years to which the election applies,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The office of the district director, or the service center,  where the return or returns, if any, for such taxable year or years were  filed,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The dates on which such return or returns, if any, were filed  and on which the tax for such taxable year or years was paid, if the tax  has been paid, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The name of the foreign country or countries having  jurisdiction to determine the ownership of any income being treated in  accordance with section 981(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Place for filing. Any return, amended return, or claim for  refund filed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in respect of any  taxable year shall be filed with the Director of International  Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20225. (See  Sec. 1.6091-3.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determination that joint election is not required. A U.S.  citizen spouse entitled to make an election under section 981(c)(1) and  this section for open taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967,  may apply to the Director of International Operations for a  determination under section 981(d)(3) that the nonresident alien spouse  is not required to join in the election by such citizen. This  application shall be made by filing with the Director of International  Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20225, a statement  setting forth the same information required by subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph and such other information as is required by the Director of  International Operations to justify a claim that the requirements of  section 981(d)(3) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section are met. The  Director of International Operations shall notify the U.S. citizen by  letter of his determination with respect to the application. If the  determination is that the nonresident alien spouse is not required to  join in the election, a copy of the letter of determination shall be  attached to each return, amended return, or claim for refund, to be  filed pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
