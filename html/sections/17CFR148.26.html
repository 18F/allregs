                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the  basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant  or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency, or on his  or her own initiative, the Presiding Officer may order further  proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional  written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings  shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the  issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly  as possible. Whether or not the position of the Commission was  substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the  administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary  adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought. No discovery  and/or evidentiary proceedings shall be permitted into the question of  whether   the agency's position was substantially justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request that the Presiding Officer order further proceedings  under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or  the disputed issues and shall explain why additional proceedings are  necessary to resolve the issues.  [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18881, May 23, 1986]</p>
