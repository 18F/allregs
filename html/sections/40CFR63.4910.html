You do not need to submit information provided by material suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For each of the data items listed in paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section that is required by the compliance option(s) you used to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit, include an example of how you determined the value, including calculations and supporting data. Supporting data can include a copy of the information provided by the supplier or manufacturer of the example coating or material or a summary of the results of testing conducted according to Sec. 63.4941(a), (b), or (c). You do not need to submit copies of any test reports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mass fraction of organic HAP for one coating, for one thinner, and for one cleaning material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Volume fraction of coating solids for one coating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Density for one coating, one thinner, and one cleaning material, except that if you use the compliant material option, only the example coating density is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of waste materials and the mass of organic HAP contained in the waste materials for which you are claiming an allowance in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The calculation of the organic HAP emission rate for the compliance option(s) you used, as specified in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the compliant materials option, provide an example calculation of the organic HAP content for one coating, using Equation 2 of Sec. 63.4941.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the emission rate without add-on controls option, provide the information specified in paragraphs (c)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The calculation of the total mass of organic HAP emissions during the initial compliance period, using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The calculation of the total volume of coating solids used during the initial compliance period, using Equation 2 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The calculation of the organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period, using Equation 3 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the emission rate with add-on controls option, provide the information specified in paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The calculation of the total mass of organic HAP emissions for the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the initial compliance period, using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The calculation of the total volume of coating solids used during the initial compliance period, using Equation 2 of Sec. 63.4951.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The calculation of the mass of organic HAP emission reduction during the initial compliance period by emission capture systems and add-on control devices, using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4961, and the calculation of the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the coating operations controlled by solvent recovery systems during each compliance period, using Equation 3 of Sec. 63.4961 as applicable.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The calculation of the organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period, using Equation 4 of Sec. 63.4961.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For the emission rate with add-on controls option, you must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(9)(i) through (v) of this section.
