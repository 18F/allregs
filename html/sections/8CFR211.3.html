                            <p class="depth0">An immigrant visa, reentry permit, refugee travel document, or a  permanent resident card shall be regarded as unexpired if the rightful  holder embarked or enplaned before the expiration of his or her  immigrant visa, reentry permit, or refugee travel document, or with  respect to a permanent resident card, before the first anniversary of  the date on which he or she departed from the United States, provided  that the vessel or aircraft on which he or she so embarked or enplaned  arrives in the United States or foreign contiguous territory on a  continuous voyage. The continuity of the voyage shall not be deemed to  have been interrupted by scheduled or emergency stops of the vessel or  aircraft en route to the United States or foreign contiguous territory,  or by a layover in foreign contiguous territory necessitated solely for  the purpose of effecting a transportation connection to the United  States.
