Such future increase or decrease in income or  family size must be verified in the same manner as other income and  eligibility factors, in accordance with the income and eligibility  verification requirements at Sec.  435.940 through Sec.  435.965,  including by self-attestation if reasonably compatible with other  electronic data obtained by the agency in accordance with such sections.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the household income of an individual determined in  accordance with this section results in financial ineligibility for  Medicaid and the household income of such individual determined in  accordance with 26 CFR 1.36B-1(e) is below 100 percent FPL, Medicaid  financial eligibility will be determined in accordance with 26 CFR  1.36B-1(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Eligibility Groups for which MAGI-based methods do not apply.
