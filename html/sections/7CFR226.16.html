                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each sponsoring organization shall comply with all provisions of  Sec. 226.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and 226.6(f),  the application must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(xviii)</em> and  226.6(b)(2)(vii). As part of its management plan, a sponsoring  organization of day care homes must document that, to perform  monitoring, it will employ the equivalent of one full-time staff person  for each 50 to 150 day care homes it sponsors. As part of its management  plan, a sponsoring organization of centers must document that, to  perform monitoring, it will employ the equivalent of one full-time staff  person for each 25 to 150 centers it sponsors. It is the State agency's  responsibility to determine the appropriate level of staffing for  monitoring for each sponsoring organization, consistent with these  specified ranges and factors that the State agency will use to determine  the appropriate level of monitoring staff for each sponsor. The  monitoring staff equivalent may include the employee's time spent on  scheduling, travel time, review time, follow-up activity, report  writing, and activities related to the annual updating of children's  enrollment forms. Sponsoring organizations that were participating in  the Program on July 29, 2002, were to have submitted, no later than July  29, 2003, a management plan or plan amendment that meets the monitoring  staffing requirement. For sponsoring organizations of centers, the  portion of the administrative costs to be charged to the Program may not  exceed 15 percent of the meal reimbursements estimated or actually  earned during the budget year, unless   the State agency grants a waiver in accordance with Sec. 226.7(g). A  sponsoring organization of centers must include in the administrative  budget all administrative costs, whether incurred by the sponsoring  organization or its sponsored centers. If at any point a sponsoring  organization determines that the meal reimbursements estimated to be  earned during the budget year will be lower than that estimated in its  administrative budget, the sponsoring organization must amend its  administrative budget to stay within the 15 percent limitation (or any  higher limit established pursuant to a waiver granted under  Sec. 226.7(g)) or seek a waiver. Failure to do so will result in  appropriate fiscal action in accordance with Sec. 226.14(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application for participation, or renewal materials, for each  child care and adult day care facility accompanied by all necessary  supporting documentation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Timely information concerning the eligibility status of child  care and adult day care facilities (such as licensing/approval actions);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For sponsoring organizations applying for initial participation  on or after June 20, 2000, if required by State law, regulation, or  policy, a bond in the form prescribed by such law, regulation, or  policy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the sponsoring organization's notice to parents, in a  form and, to the maximum extent practicable, language easily  understandable by the participant's parents or guardians. The notice  must inform them of their facility's participation in CACFP, the  Program's benefits, the name and telephone number of the sponsoring  organization, and the name and telephone number of the State agency  responsible for administration of CACFP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the sponsoring organization chooses to establish procedures  for determining a day care home seriously deficient that supplement the  procedures in paragraph (l) of this section, a copy of those  supplemental procedures. If the State agency has made the sponsoring  organization responsible for the administrative review of a proposed  termination of a day care home's agreement for cause, pursuant to  Sec. 226.6(l)(1), a copy of the sponsoring organization's administrative  review procedures. The sponsoring organization's supplemental serious  deficiency and administrative review procedures must comply with  paragraph (l) of this section and Sec. 226.6(l);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A copy of their outside employment policy. The policy must  restrict other employment by employees that interferes with an  employee's performance of Program-related duties and responsibilities,  including outside employment that constitutes a real or apparent  conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For sponsoring organizations of day care homes, the name,  mailing address, and date of birth of each provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each sponsoring organization shall accept final administrative  and financial responsibility for food service operations in all child  care and adult day care facilities under its jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each sponsoring organization must provide adequate supervisory  and operational personnel for the effective management and monitoring of  the program at all facilities it sponsors. Each sponsoring organization  must employ monitoring staff sufficient to meet the requirements of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section. At a minimum, Program assistance must  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-approval visits to each child care and adult day care  facility for which application is made to discuss Program benefits and  verify that the proposed food service does not exceed the capability of  the child care facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training on Program duties and responsibilities to key staff  from all sponsored facilities prior to the beginning of Program  operations. At a minimum, such training must include instruction,  appropriate to the level of staff experience and duties, on the  Program's meal patterns, meal counts, claims submission and review  procedures, recordkeeping requirements, and reimbursement system.  Attendance by key staff, as defined by the State agency, is mandatory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional mandatory training sessions for key staff from all  sponsored child care and adult day care facilities not less frequently  than annually. At a minimum, such training must include instruction,  appropriate   to the level of staff experience and duties, on the Program's meal  patterns, meal counts, claims submission and review procedures,  recordkeeping requirements, and reimbursement system. Attendance by key  staff, as defined by the State agency, is mandatory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Review elements. Reviews that assess whether the facility has  corrected problems noted on the previous review(s), a reconciliation of  the facility's meal counts with enrollment and attendance records for a  five-day period, as specified in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section,  and an assessment of the facility's compliance with the Program  requirements pertaining to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The meal pattern;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Licensing or approval;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Attendance at training;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Meal counts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Menu and meal records; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The annual updating and content of enrollment forms (if the  facility is required to have enrollment forms on file, as specified in  Sec. Sec. 226.15(e)(2) and 226.15(e)(3)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reconciliation of meal counts. Reviews must examine the meal  counts recorded by the facility for five consecutive days during the  current and/or prior claiming period. For each day examined, reviewers  must use enrollment and attendance records (except in those outside- school-hours care centers, at-risk afterschool care centers, and  emergency shelters where enrollment records are not required) to  determine the number of participants in care during each meal service  and attempt to reconcile those numbers to the numbers of breakfasts,  lunches, suppers, and/or snacks recorded in the facility's meal count  for that day. Based on that comparison, reviewers must determine whether  the meal counts were accurate. If there is a discrepancy between the  number of participants enrolled or in attendance on the day of review  and prior meal counting patterns, the reviewer must attempt to reconcile  the difference and determine whether the establishment of an overclaim  is necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Frequency and type of required facility reviews. Sponsoring  organizations must review each facility three times each year, except as  described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section. In addition:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least two of the three reviews must be unannounced;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least one unannounced review must include observation of a  meal service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> At least one review must be made during each new facility's  first four weeks of Program operations; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Not more than six months may elapse between reviews.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Averaging of required reviews. If a sponsoring organization  conducts one unannounced review of a facility in a year and finds no  serious deficiencies (as described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section,  regardless of the type of facility), the sponsoring organization may  choose not to conduct a third review of the facility that year, and may  make its second review announced, provided that the sponsoring  organization conducts an average of three reviews of all of its  facilities that year, and that it conducts an average of two unannounced  reviews of all of its facilities that year. When the sponsoring  organization uses this averaging provision, and a specific facility  receives two reviews in one review year, its first review in the next  review year must occur no more than nine months after the previous  review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Follow-up reviews. If, in conducting a facility review, a  sponsoring organization detects one or more serious deficiency, the next  review of that facility must be unannounced. Serious deficiencies are  those described at paragraph (l)(2) of this section, regardless of the  type of facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Notification of unannounced reviews. Sponsoring organizations  of centers must provide each center with written notification of the  right of the sponsoring organization, the State agency, the Department,  and other State and Federal officials to make announced or unannounced  reviews of its operations during the center's normal hours of operation,  and must also notify sponsored centers that anyone making such reviews  must show photo identification that demonstrates that they are employees  of one of these entities. For sponsored centers participating on July  29, 2002, the sponsoring organization was to have provided this   notice no later than August 29, 2002. For sponsored centers that are  approved after July 29, 2002, the sponsoring organization must provide  the notice before meal service under the Program begins. Sponsoring  organizations must provide day care homes notification of unannounced  visits in accordance with Sec. 226.18(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Other requirements pertaining to unannounced reviews.  Unannounced reviews must be made only during the facility's normal hours  of operation, and monitors making such reviews must show photo  identification that demonstrates that they are employees of the  sponsoring organization, the State agency, the Department, or other  State and Federal agencies authorized to audit or investigate Program  operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Imminent threat to health or safety. Sponsoring organizations  that discover in a facility conduct or conditions that pose an imminent  threat to the health or safety of participating children or the public,  must immediately notify the appropriate State or local licensing or  health authorities and take action that is consistent with the  recommendations and requirements of those authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> and any  recordkeeping requirements established by the State agency in order to  justify the administrative payments made in accordance with  Sec. 226.12(a). Failure to maintain such records shall be grounds for  the denial of reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The State agency may require a sponsoring organization to enter  into separate agreements for the administration of separate types of  facilities (child care centers, day care homes, adult day care centers,  emergency shelters, at-risk afterschool care centers, and outside- school-hours care centers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each sponsoring organization electing to receive advance  payments of program funds for day care homes shall disburse the full  amount of such payments within five working days of receipt from the  State agency. If the sponsor requests the full operating advance to  which it is entitled, the advances to day care homes shall be the full  amount which the sponsor expects the home to earn based on the number of  meals projected to be served to enrolled children during the period  covered by the advance multiplied by the applicable payment rate as  specified in Sec. 226.13(c). If a sponsor elects to receive only a part  of the operating advance to which it is entitled, or if the full  operating advance is insufficient to provide a full advance to each  home, the advance shall be disbursed to its homes in a manner and an  amount the sponsor deems appropriate. Each sponsor shall disburse any  reimbursement payments for food service due to each day care home within  five working days of receipt from the State agency. Such payment shall  be based on the number of meals served to enrolled children at each day  care home, less any payments advanced to such home. However, the  sponsoring organization may withhold from Program payments to each home  an amount equal to food service operating costs incurred by the  sponsoring organization in behalf of the home and with the home  provider's written consent. If payments from the State agency are not  sufficient to provide all day care homes under the sponsoring  organization's jurisdiction with advance payments and reimbursement  payments, available monies shall be used to provide all due  reimbursement payments before advances are disbursed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Sponsoring organizations shall make payments of program funds to  child care centers, adult day care centers, emergency shelters, at-risk  afterschool care centers, or outside-school-hours care centers within  five working days of receipt from the State agency, on the basis of the  management plan approved by the State agency, and may not exceed the  Program costs documented at each facility during any fiscal year; except  in those States where the State agency has chosen the option to  implement a meals times rates payment system. In those States which  implement this optional method of reimbursement, such disbursements may  not exceed the rates times the number   of meals documented at each facility during any fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Disbursements of advance payments may be withheld from child and  adult day care facilities which fail to submit reports required by  Sec. 226.15(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A for-profit organization shall be eligible to serve as a  sponsoring organization for for-profit centers which have the same legal  identity as the organization, but shall not be eligible to sponsor for- profit centers which are legally distinct from the organization, day  care homes, or public or private nonprofit centers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Before sponsoring organizations expend administrative funds to  assist family day care homes in becoming licensed, they shall obtain the  following information from each such home: a completed free and reduced  price application which documents that the provider meets the Program's  income standards; evidence of its application for licensing and official  documentation of the defects that are impeding its licensing approval;  and a completed CACFP application. These funding requests are limited to  $300 per home and are only available to each home once.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Termination of agreements for cause--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The sponsoring  organization must initiate action to terminate the agreement of a day  care home for cause if the sponsoring organization determines the day  care home has committed one or more serious deficiency listed in  paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> List of serious deficiencies for day care homes. Serious  deficiencies for day care homes are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submission of false information on the application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submission of false claims for reimbursement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Simultaneous participation under more than one sponsoring  organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Non-compliance with the Program meal pattern;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Failure to keep required records;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct or conditions that threaten the health or safety of a  child(ren) in care, or the public health or safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A determination that the day care home has been convicted of  any activity that occurred during the past seven years and that  indicated a lack of business integrity. A lack of business integrity  includes fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery,  bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false  statements, receiving stolen property, making false claims, obstruction  of justice, or any other activity indicating a lack of business  integrity as defined by the State agency, or the concealment of such a  conviction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Failure to participate in training; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Any other circumstance related to non-performance under the  sponsoring organization-day care home agreement, as specified by the  sponsoring organization or the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice of serious deficiency. The sponsoring organization must  notify the day care home that it has been found to be seriously  deficient. The sponsoring organization must provide a copy of the  serious deficiency notice to the State agency. The notice must specify:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The serious deficiency(ies);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The actions to be taken by the day care home to correct the  serious deficiency(ies);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The time allotted to correct the serious deficiency(ies) (as  soon as possible, but not to exceed 30 days);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> That the serious deficiency determination is not subject to  administrative review.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> That failure to fully and permanently correct the serious  deficiency(ies) within the allotted time will result in the sponsoring  organization proposed termination of the day care home's agreement and  the proposed disqualification of the day care home and its principals;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> That the day care home's voluntary termination of its agreement  with the sponsoring organization after having been notified that it is  seriously deficient will still result in the day care home's formal  termination by the sponsoring organization and placement of the day care  home and its principals on the National disqualified list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Successful corrective action. If the day care home corrects the  serious deficiency(ies) within the allotted time and to the sponsoring  organization's satisfaction, the sponsoring organization must notify the  day care home that it has temporarily defer its determination of serious  deficiency. The sponsoring organization must also provide a copy of the  notice to the State agency. However, if the sponsoring organization  accepts the provider's corrective action, but later determines that the  corrective action was not permanent or complete, the sponsoring  organization must then propose to terminate the provider's Program  agreement and disqualify the provider, as set forth in paragraph  (l)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proposed termination of agreement and proposed  disqualification. If timely corrective action is not taken to fully and  permanently correct the serious deficiency(ies) cited, the sponsoring  organization must issue a notice proposing to terminate the day care  home's agreement for cause. The notice must explain the day care home's  opportunity for an administrative review of the proposed termination in  accordance with Sec. 226.6(l). The sponsoring organization must provide  a copy of the notice to the State agency. The notice must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Inform the day care home that it may continue to participate and  receive Program reimbursement for eligible meals served until its  administrative review is concluded;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Inform the day care home that termination of the day care home's  agreement will result in the day care home's termination for cause and  disqualification; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> State that if the day care home seeks to voluntarily terminate  its agreement after receiving the notice of intent to terminate, the day  care home will still be placed on the National disqualified list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Program payments. The sponsoring organization must continue to  pay any claims for reimbursement for eligible meals served until the  serious deficiency(ies) is corrected or the day care home's agreement is  terminated, including the period of any administrative review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Agreement termination and disqualification. The sponsoring  organization must immediately terminate the day care home's agreement  and disqualify the day care home when the administrative review official  upholds the sponsoring organization's proposed termination and proposed  disqualification, or when the day care home's opportunity to request an  administrative review expires. At the same time the notice is issued,  the sponsoring organization must provide a copy of the termination and  disqualification letter to the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Suspension of participation for day care homes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. If State or local health or licensing officials have  cited a day care home for serious health or safety violations, the  sponsoring organization must immediately suspend the home's CACFP  participation prior to any formal action to revoke the home's licensure  or approval. If the sponsoring organization determines that there is an  imminent threat to the health or safety of participants at a day care  home, or that the day care home has engaged in activities that threaten  the public health or safety, and the licensing agency cannot make an  immediate onsite visit, the sponsoring organization must immediately  notify the appropriate State or local licensing and health authorities  and take action that is consistent with the recommendations and  requirements of those authorities. An imminent threat to the health or  safety of participants and engaging in activities that threaten the   public health or safety constitute serious deficiencies; however, the  sponsoring organization must use the procedures in this paragraph (l)(4)  (and not the procedures in paragraph (l)(3) of this section) to provide  the day care home notice of the suspension of participation, serious  deficiency, and proposed termination of the day care home's agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of suspension, serious deficiency, and proposed  termination. The sponsoring organization must notify the day care home  that its participation has been suspended, that the day care home has  been determined seriously deficient, and that the sponsoring  organization proposes to terminate the day care home's agreement for  cause, and must provide a copy of the notice to the State agency. The  notice must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Specify the serious deficiency(ies) found and the day care  home's opportunity for an administrative review of the proposed  termination in accordance with Sec. 226.6(l);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> State that participation (including all Program payments) will  remain suspended until the administrative review is concluded;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Inform the day care home that if the administrative review  official overturns the suspension, the day care home may claim  reimbursement for eligible meals served during the suspension;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Inform the day care home that termination of the day care home's  agreement will result in the placement of the day care home on the  National disqualified list; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> State that if the day care home seeks to voluntarily terminate  its agreement after receiving the notice of proposed termination, the  day care home will still be terminated for cause and disqualified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Agreement termination and disqualification. The sponsoring  organization must immediately terminate the day care home's agreement  and disqualify the day care home when the administrative review official  upholds the sponsoring organization's proposed termination, or when the  day care home's opportunity to request an administrative review expires.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Program payments. A sponsoring organization is prohibited from  making any Program payments to a day care home that has been suspended  until any administrative review of the proposed termination is  completed. If the suspended day care home prevails in the administrative  review of the proposed termination, the sponsoring organization must  reimburse the day care home for eligible meals served during the  suspension period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Sponsoring organizations of family day care homes must not make  payments to employees or contractors solely on the basis of the number  of homes recruited. However, such employees or contractors may be paid  or evaluated on the basis of recruitment activities accomplished.
