                                Sec. 250.51  Crediting for, and use of, donated foods.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Crediting for donated foods. In both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, the food service management company must credit the recipient agency for the value of all donated foods received for use in the recipient agency's meal service in a school year or fiscal year (including both entitlement and bonus foods). Such requirement includes crediting for the value of donated foods contained in processed end products if the food service management company's contract requires it to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procure processed end products on behalf of the recipient agency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Act as an intermediary in passing the donated food value in processed end products on to the recipient agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method and frequency of crediting. The recipient agency may permit crediting for the value of donated foods

through invoice reductions, refunds, discounts, or other means. However, all forms of crediting must provide clear documentation of the value received from the donated foods--e.g., by separate line item entries on invoices. If provided for in a fixed-price contract, the recipient agency may permit a food service management company to pre-credit for donated foods. In pre-crediting, a deduction for the value of donated foods is included in the established fixed price per meal. However, the recipient agency must ensure that the food service management company provides an additional credit for any donated foods not accounted for in the fixed price per meal--e.g., for donated foods that are not made available until later in the year. In cost-reimbursable contracts, crediting may be performed by disclosure; i.e., the food service management company credits the recipient agency for the value of donated foods by disclosing, in its billing for food costs submitted to the recipient agency, the savings resulting from the receipt of donated foods for the billing period. In all cases, the recipient agency must require crediting to be performed not less frequently than annually, and must ensure that the specified method of valuation of donated foods permits crediting to be achieved in the required time period. A school food authority must also ensure that the method, and timing, of crediting does not cause its cash resources to exceed the limits established in 7 CFR 210.9(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Donated food values required in crediting. The recipient agency must ensure that, in crediting it for the value of donated foods, the food service management company uses the donated food values determined by the distributing agency, in accordance with Sec. 250.58(e), or, if approved by the distributing agency, donated food values determined by an alternate means of the recipient agency's choosing. For example, the recipient agency may, with the approval of the distributing agency, specify that the value will be the average price per pound for a food, or for a group or category of foods (e.g., all frozen foods or cereal products), as listed in market journals over a specified period of time. However, the method of determining the donated food values to be used in crediting must be included in procurement documents and in the contract, and must result in the determination of actual values; e.g., the average USDA purchase price for the period of the contract with the food vendor, or the average price per pound listed in market journals over a specified period of time. Negotiation of such values is not permitted. Additionally, the method of valuation must ensure that crediting may be achieved in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and at the specific frequency established in procurement documents and in the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of donated foods. The food service management company must use all donated ground beef, donated ground pork, and all processed end products, in the recipient agency's food service, and must use all other donated foods, or commercially purchased foods of the same generic identity, of U.S. origin, and of equal or better quality than the donated foods, in the recipient agency's food service (unless the contract specifically stipulates that the donated foods, and not such commercial substitutes, be used).</p>
