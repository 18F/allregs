                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. The owner must accept applications for admission to  the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Both the owner (or designee)  and the   applicant must complete and sign the application. For this part 880 and  24 CFR part 881 projects, on request, the owner must furnish copies of  all applications to HUD and the PHA, if applicable. For 24 CFR part 883  projects, on request, the owner must furnish to the Agency or HUD copies  of all applications received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants. The owner  is responsible for obtaining and verifying information related to income  eligibility in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and evidence  related to citizenship and eligible immigration status in accordance  with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, to determine whether the applicant is  eligible for assistance in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR  part 5, and to select families for admission to the program, which  includes giving selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5,  subpart D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the owner determines that the family is eligible and is  otherwise acceptable and units are available, the owner will assign the  family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards.  If no suitable unit is available, the owner will place the family on a  waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable  unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the  applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the  owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications are being  accepted for that reason, provided the owner complies with the  procedures for informing applicants about admission preferences as  provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owner determines that an applicant is ineligible on the  basis of income or family composition, or because of failure to meet the  disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers (as  provided by 24 CFR part 5), or because of failure by an applicant to  sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim  information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided  by 24 CFR parts 5 and 813), or that the owner is not selecting the  applicant for other reasons, the owner will promptly notify the  applicant in writing of the determination and its reasons, and that the  applicant has the right to meet with the owner or managing agent in  accordance with HUD requirements. Where the owner is a PHA, the  applicant may request an informal hearing. If the PHA determines that  the applicant is not eligible, the PHA will notify the applicant and  inform the applicant that he or she has the right to request HUD review  of the PHA's determination. The applicant may also exercise other rights  if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against  on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.  See 24 CFR part 5 for the informal review provisions for the denial of a  Federal preference or the failure to establish citizenship or eligible  immigration status and for notice requirements where assistance is  terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced based on wage and claim  information obtained by HUD from a State Wage Information Collection  Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which  provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data  required by HUD, must be maintained and retained for three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reexamination of family income and composition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regular  reexaminations. The owner must reexamine the income and composition of  all families at least every 12 months. After consultation with the  family and upon verification of the information, the owner must make  appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with  part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is  still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing  Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and  must carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the  annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must  require the family to disclose the verify Social Security Numbers, as  provided by 24 CFR part 5. For requirements regarding the signing and  submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and  claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see  24 CFR part 5. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995,  the   owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning  obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration  status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination,  the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 and verify the  immigration status of any new family member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim reexaminations. The family must comply with provisions  in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the  owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or  other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the  owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined  to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other  circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment,  Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See 24 CFR  part 5 for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of  Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family  members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of  consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State  Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At any interim  reexamination after June 19, 1995, when a new family member has been  added, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5  concerning obtaining and processing evidence of the citizenship or  eligible immigration status of any new family member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuation of housing assistance payments. A family's  eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments continues until the Total  Tenant Payment equals the contract rent plus any utility allowance. The  termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's  other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the  resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or  other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However,  eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements,  for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification  information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification  requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5,  or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining wage and  claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as  provided by 24 CFR part 5. See 24 CFR part 5 for provisions requiring  termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or  eligible immigration status and also for provisions concerning certain  assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with  eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration  status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions  concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
