                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. License Exception CIV authorizes exports and reexports of  items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to part 774  of the EAR) that have a license requirement to the ultimate destination  pursuant to the Commerce Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of  the EAR) for NS reasons only; and identified by ``CIV--Yes'' in the  License Exception section of the Export Control Classification Number  (ECCN), provided the items are destined to civil end-users   for civil end-uses in Country Group D:1, except North Korea (Supplement  No. 1 to part 740 of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restricted end-users and end-uses. You may not  use CIV if you ``know'' the item will be or is intended to be exported,  reexported, or transferred (in-country) to military uses or military  end-users. Such exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) will  continue to require a license. In addition to conventional military  activities, military uses include any proliferation activities described  and prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Visa status. Deemed exports under License Exception CIV are not  authorized to foreign nationals in an expired visa status. It is the  responsibility of the exporter to ensure that, in the case of deemed  exports, the foreign national maintains a valid U.S. visa, if required  to hold a visa from the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirement. See Sec. 743.1 of the EAR for reporting  requirements for exports of certain items under this License Exception.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign National Review (FNR) requirement for deemed exports-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission requirement. Prior to disclosing eligible technology to a  foreign national under this License Exception, you must submit a Foreign  National Review (FNR) request to BIS, as required under Sec. 748.8(s)  of the EAR. Your FNR request must include information about the foreign  national required under Sec. 748.8(t) of the EAR and set forth in  Supplement No. 2 of part 748 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confirmation of eligibility. You may not use License Exception  CIV for a deemed export until you have obtained confirmation of  eligibility by checking the System for Tracking Export License  Applications (https://snapr.bis.doc.gov /stela) or through the  Simplified Network Application Procedure (https://snapr.bis.doc.gov).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Action by BIS. Within nine business days of the registration of  the FNR request, BIS will refer the FNR request electronically, along  with all necessary documentation for interagency review, or if necessary  return the FNR request without action (e.g., if the information provided  is incomplete). Processing time starts at the point at which the  notification is registered into BIS's electronic system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of  Defense, State, Energy, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review  the FNR request. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the BIS referral,  the reviewing agency will provide BIS with a recommendation either to  approve or deny the FNR request. A reviewing agency that fails to  provide a recommendation within 30 days shall be deemed to have no  objection to the final decision of BIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Action on the FNR Request. After the interagency review period,  BIS will promptly notify the applicant regarding the FNR request, i.e.,  whether the FNR request is approved, denied, or more time is needed to  consider the request.
