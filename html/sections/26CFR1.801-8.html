                                Sec. 1.801-8  Contracts with reserves based on segregated asset
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--(1) Annuity contracts include variable annuity  contracts. Section 801(g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> provides that for purposes of part I,  subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, an annuity contract includes a  contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed  on the basis of recognized mortality tables and the investment  experience of the company issuing such a contract. A variable annuity  differs from the ordinary or fixed dollar annuity in that the annuity  benefits payable under a variable annuity contract vary with the  insurance company's investment experience with respect to such contracts  while the annuity benefits paid under a fixed dollar annuity contract  are guaranteed irrespective of the company's actual investment earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracts with reserves based on a segregated asset account. (i)  For purposes of part I, section 801(g)(1)(B) defines the term contract  with reserves based on a segregated asset account as a contract  (individual or group):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which provides for the allocation of all or part of the amounts  received under the contract to an account which, pursuant to State law  or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the  company,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Which provides for the payment of annuities, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under which the amounts paid in, or the amount paid as  annuities, reflect the investment return and the market value of the  segregated asset account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term contract with reserves based on a segregated asset  account includes a contract such as a variable annuity contract, which  reflects the investment return and the market value of the segregated  asset account, even though such contract provides for the payment of an  annuity computed on the basis of recognized mortality tables, but the  term includes such contract only for the period during which it  satisfies the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and subdivision (i)  of this subparagraph. However, such term does not include a pension  contract written on the basis of the so-called new-money concept. Thus,  for example, such term does not include a pension contract whereby  reserves are credited on the basis of the company's new high yield  investments. Furthermore, such term does not include a contract which  during the taxable year contains a right to participate in the divisible  surplus of the company where such right merely reflects the company's  investment return. Nevertheless, the term does include a contract which  meets the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and of this subparagraph  even if part of the amounts received are, for example, allocated to  reserves under provisions of the contract which are written on the basis  of the new-money concept. However, such reserves do not qualify as a  segregated asset account referred to in section 801(g) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> and subdivision (i)(c) of   this subparagraph after such cessation. Thus, a contract with reserves  based on a segregated asset account includes a contract under which the  reflection of investment return and market value terminates at the  beginning of the annuity payments, but only for the period prior to such  termination. For example, if the purchaser of a variable annuity  contract which meets such requirements elects an option which provides  for the payment of a fixed dollar annuity, then such contract shall be  considered as satisfying such requirements only for the period prior to  the time such contract ceases to reflect current investment return and  current market value. Furthermore, a group annuity contract which  satisfies the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and subdivision (i)  of this subparagraph shall be considered as continuing to meet such  requirements even though a certificate holder under the group contract  elects an option which provides for the payment of a fixed dollar  annuity. However, the annuity attributable to such certificate holder  shall not be considered as satisfying such requirements as of the time  such annuity ceases to reflect current investment return and current  market value. On the other hand, a group annuity contract which does not  reflect current market value shall not be considered as satisfying such  requirements even though a certificate holder under the group contract  elects an option which provides for the payment of a variable annuity.  However, the variable annuity attributable to such certificate holder  shall be considered as satisfying such requirements as of the time such  variable annuity commences to reflect current investment return and  current market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.801-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Separate accounting. (1) For purposes of part I, section  801(g)(3) provides that a life insurance company (as defined in section  801(a) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.801-3) which issues contracts with  reserves based on segregated asset accounts (as defined in section 801  (g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em> and paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall separately account  for each and every income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, and  other liability item which is properly attributable to such segregated  asset accounts. In those cases where such items are not directly  accounted for, separate accounting shall be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> According to the method regularly employed by the company, if  such method is reasonable, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases in a manner which, in the opinion of the  district director, is reasonable.  A method of separate accounting for such items as are not accounted for  directly will be deemed ``regularly employed'' by a life insurance  company if the method was consistently followed in prior taxable years,  or if, in the case of a company which has never before issued contracts  with reserves based on segregated asset accounts, the company initiates  in the first taxable year for which it issues such contracts a  reasonable method of separate accounting for such items and consistently  follows such method thereafter. Ordinarily, a company regularly employs  a method of accounting in accordance with the statute of the State,  Territory, or the District of Columbia, in which it operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every life insurance company issuing contracts with reserves  based on segregated asset accounts shall keep such permanent records and  other data relating to such contracts as is necessary to enable the  district director to determine the correctness of the application of the  rules prescribed in section 301(g) and this section and to ascertain the  accuracy of the computations involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Investment yield. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of part I, section  801(g)(4)(A) provides that the policy and other contract liability  requirements (as determined under section 805), and the life insurance  company's share of investment yield (as determined under sections 804(a)  or 809(b)), shall be separately computed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the items separately accounted for in accordance  with section 801(g)(3) and paragraph (c) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excluding the items taken into account under subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph.  Thus, for purposes of determining both taxable investment income and  gain or loss from operations, a life insurance company shall separately  compute the life insurance company's share of the investment yield on  the assets in its segregated asset account without regard to the policy  and other contract liability requirements of, and the investment income  attributable to, contracts with reserves that are not based on the  segregated asset account. Such separate computations shall be made after  any allocation required under section 801(g)(4)(B) and subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Section 801(g)(4)(B) provides that if the net short-term  capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) exceeds the net long-term  capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)), determined without regard  to any separate computations under section 801(g)(4)(A) and subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph, then such excess shall be allocated between  section 801(g)(4)(A) (i) and (ii) and subparagraph (1) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (ii) of  this paragraph. Such allocation shall be in proportion to the respective  contributions to such excess of the items taken into account under each  such section and subparagraph. The allocation under this subparagraph  shall be made before the separate computations prescribed by section  801(g)(4)(A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operation of the allocation required under section  801(g)(4)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For the taxable year 1962, T, a life insurance company  which issues regular life insurance and annuity contracts and contracts  with reserves based on segregated asset accounts, had (without regard to  section 801(g)(4)(A)) realized short-term capital gains of $10,000 and  short-term capital losses of $10,000 attributable to its general asset  accounts and realized short-term capital gains of $12,000 attributable  to its segregated asset accounts. For the taxable year 1962, the excess  of the net short-term capital gain ($10,000+$12,000-$10,000, or $12,000)  over the net long-term capital loss (0) was $12,000. Of the excess of  $12,000, 100 percent was contributed by the segregated asset accounts.  Applying the provisions of section 801(g)(4)(B), T would allocate the  entire $12,000 to its segregated asset accounts for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that for  the taxable year 1962, T had (without regard to section 801(g)(4)(A))  realized short-term capital losses of $8,000 attributable to its general  asset accounts and realized long-term capital gains of $1,000 and long- term capital losses of $5,000 attributable to its segregated asset  accounts. For the taxable year 1962, the excess of the net short-term  capital gain ($10,000+$12,000-$8,000, or $14,000) over the net long-term  capital loss ($5,000-$1,000, or $4,000) was $10,000. Of the excess of  $10,000, the general asset accounts contributed 20 percent ($2,000  ($10,000-$8,000)/$10,000) and the segregated asset accounts contributed  80 percent ($8,000 ($12,000-$4,000)/$10,000). Applying the provisions of  section 801(g)(4)(B), T would allocate $2,000 ($10,000x20 percent) to  its general asset accounts and $8,000 ($10,000x80 percent) to its  segregated asset accounts for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. W is a life insurance company which issues regular life  insurance and annuity contracts and contracts with reserves based on  either of two segregated asset accounts, Separate Account C or Separate  Account D. For the taxable year 1962, W had (without regard to section  801(g)(4)(A)) realized short-term capital gains of $16,000 and long-term  capital losses of $15,000 attributable to its general asset accounts,  long-term capital gains of $12,000 and short-term capital losses of  $6,000 attributable to Separate Account C and long-term capital gains of  $7,000 and short-term capital losses of $5,000 attributable to Separate  Account D.   For the taxable year 1962, the excess of the net short-term capital gain  ($16,000-$6,000-$5,000) over the net long-term capital loss (0) was  $5,000. Of the $5,000 excess, 20 percent ($16,000-$15,000/$5,000) was  contributed by the general asset accounts, leaving 80 percent as the  amount contributed by the segregated asset accounts. Applying the  provisions of section 801(g)(4)(B) W would allocate $1,000 (20 percent  of $5,000) to the general asset accounts, leaving $4,000 (80 percent of  $5,000) to be allocated among the segregated asset accounts, Separate  Account C and Separate Account D. W would allocate $3,000 of the $4,000  to Separate Account C computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.135   W would allocate $1,000 of the $4,000 to Separate Account D computed as  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.136</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Policy and other contract liability requirements.

Thus, the  policy and other contract liability requirement for Separate Account A  is $33,280.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Separate Account B. The current earnings rate determined under  section 805 (b)(2) with respect to the items separately accounted for  under Separate Account B, prior to the reduction provided for under  section 801(g)(5)(A), is 4.40 percent (the investment yield, $39,600  divided by the mean of the assets, $900,000). The company retained with  respect to such reserves from gross investment income on Separate  Account B a total of $5,720. The company had deductions allowable under  section 804(c) with respect to such account of $4,400. Accordingly, for  purposes of section 801(g)(5)(A)(i) the amount retained by the company  was $1,320 (the total amount retained of $5,720 less the deductions  allowable under section 804(c) of $4,400). The reduction percentage for  purposes of section 801(g)(5)(A) is 0.15 percent (the amount retained of  $1,320 divided by the mean of the reserves based on Separate Account B  of $880,000 ($820,000 plus $60,000)). Therefore, the adjusted reserves  rate and the current earnings rate for purposes of section 805(b), and  the rate of interest assumed for purposes of section 805(c) and  809(a)(2) is equal to 4.25 percent (the current earnings rate of 4.40  percent less the reduction percentage of 0.15 percent).</p><p class="depth0">With respect to reserves based on segregated asset accounts other  than life insurance reserves, Separate Account B had such reserves at  December 31, 1962, of $120,000. The mean of such reserves was $60,000.  The rate of interest assumed with respect to such reserves is 4.25  percent, as computed above. Accordingly, there shall be included as  interest paid within the meaning of section 805(e)(1) the amount of  $2,550 (the mean of such reserves, $60,000 multiplied by the rate of  interest assumed of 4.25 percent).</p><p class="depth0">The policy and other contract liability requirements with respect to  Separate Account B is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2), the amount is $34,850  (the mean of the life insurance reserves, $820,000, multiplied by the  current earnings rate, as determined under section 801(g)(5)(A), 4.25  percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of section 805(a)(3), the amount is $2,550 (the  mean of the reserves based on Separate Account B other than life  insurance reserves, $60,000, multiplied by the rate of interest assumed,  as determined under section 801(g)(5)(A), 4.25 percent). It has been  assumed that there was no other interest paid on Separate Account B  within   the meaning of section 805(e). If there was other interest paid with  respect to Separate Account B that met the requirements of section  805(e), however, then such interest would be included under section  805(a)(3).

Company M, a life insurance company issuing only contracts  with reserves based on segregated asset accounts as defined in section  801(g)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section (other than contracts  described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D)), increased its  life insurance reserves held with respect to such contracts during the  taxable year 1962 by $275,000. Of the total increase in the reserves,  $100,000 was attributable to premium receipts, $50,000 to dividends and  interest, $100,000 to unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets  held in relation to such reserves, and $25,000 to realized capital gains  on the sale of such assets. As of the close of the taxable year 1962,  the reserves held by company M with respect to all such contracts  amounted to $1,275,000. However, under section 801(g)(6) and this  subparagraph, this amount must be reduced by the $100,000 unrealized  asset value appreciation and the $25,000 of realized capital gains.   Accordingly, for purposes of section 810(a) and (b), the amount of these  reserves which is to be taken into account as of the close of the  taxable year 1962 under section 810(c) is $1,150,000 ($1,275,000 less  $125,000). However, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the amount  of these reserves which is to be taken into account as of the beginning  of the taxable year 1963 under section 810(c) is $1,275,000 (the amount  as of the close of the taxable year 1962 before reduction of $125,000  for unrealized appreciation and realized capital gains).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under section 801(g)(6), the deduction allowable for items  described in section 809(d) (1) and (7) (relating to death benefits and  assumption reinsurance, respectively) with respect to segregated asset  accounts shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of such items is  increased for the taxable year by appreciation (or shall be increased to  the extent that the amount of such items is decreased for the taxable  year by depreciation) not reflected in adjustments required to be made  under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On June 30, 1962, X, a life insurance company, reinsured a  portion of its insurance contracts with reserves based on segregated  asset accounts with Y, a life insurance company, under an agreement  whereby Y agreed to assume and become solely liable under the contracts  reinsured. The reserves on the contracts reinsured by X were $90,000, of  which $10,000 was attributable to unrealized appreciation in the value  of the assets held in relation to such reserves. However, no amounts had  been added to the reserves by reason of the unrealized appreciation of  $10,000 and consequently, the $10,000 was not reflected in adjustments  to reserves under section 809(g)(6) or subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph. Under the reinsurance agreement, X made a payment of $90,000  in cash to Y for assuming such contracts. Applying the provisions of  section 809(d)(7), and assuming no other such reinsurance transactions  by X during the taxable year, X would have an allowable deduction of  $90,000 as a result of this payment on June 30, 1962. However, applying  the provisions of section 801(g)(6) and this subparagraph, the actual  deduction allowed would be $80,000 ($90,000 less $10,000). See section  806 (a) and Sec. 1.806-3 for the adjustments in reserves and assets to  be made by X and Y as a result of this transaction. For the treatment by  Y of this $90,000 payment, see section 809(c)(1) and paragraph (a)(1)(i)  of Sec. 1.809-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(6)</em>, for contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C),  (D), or (E) based on segregated asset accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Additional separate computation--(1) Assets and total insurance  liabilities.

The tax so imposed is equal to  3\3/4\ percent of the amount of such income not in excess of $200,000,  plus 6\1/2\ percent of the amount of such income in excess of $200,000.

The  gross income, the deduction under section 803 (g)(1) for wholly tax- exempt interest, and the deduction under section 242 for partially tax- exempt interest, are decreased by the appropriate amortization of  premium and increased by the appropriate accrual of discount  attributable to the taxable year on bonds, notes, debentures, or other  evidences of indebtedness held by a life insurance company. See section  803 (i) and Sec. 1.803-6.
