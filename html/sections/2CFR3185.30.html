The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., Sec. 3185.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, IMLS policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.</p>
