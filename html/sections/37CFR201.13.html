                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Notice of Objection is a notice, as required  by section   110(4) of title 17 of the United States Code as amended by Pub. L. 94- 553, to be served as a condition of preventing the noncommercial  performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work under certain  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, the copyright owner of a  nondramatic literary or musical work is the author of the work  (including, in the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other  person for whom the work was prepared), or a person or organization that  has obtained ownership of the exclusive right, initially owned by the  author of performance of the type referred to in 17 U.S.C. 110(4). If  the other requirements of this section are met, a Notice of Objection  may cover the works of more than one copyright owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form. The Copyright Office does not provide printed forms for  the use of persons serving Notices of Objection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Notice of Objection must clearly state that the  copyright owner objects to the performance, and must include all of the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reference to the statutory authority on which the Notice of  Objection is based, either by citation of 17 U.S.C. 110(4) or by a more  general characterization or description of that statutory provision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date and place of the performance to which an objection is  being made; however, if the exact date or place of a particular  performance, or both, are not known to the copyright owner, it is  sufficient if the Notice describes whatever information the copyright  owner has about the date and place of a particular performance, and the  source of that information unless the source was considered private or  confidential;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Clear identification, by title and at least one author, of the  particular nondramatic literary or musical work or works, to the  performance of which the copyright owner thereof is lodging objection; a  Notice may cover any number of separately identified copyrighted works  owned by the copyright owner or owners serving the objection.  Alternatively, a blanket notice, with or without separate identification  of certain copyrighted works, and purporting to cover one or more groups  of copyrighted works not separately identified by title and author,  shall have effect if the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section are met; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A concise statement of the reasons for the objection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A blanket notice purporting to cover one or more groups of  copyrighted works not separately identified by title and author shall be  valid only if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Notice shall identify each group of works covered by the  blanket notice by a description of any common characteristics  distinguishing them from other copyrighted works, such as common author,  common copyright owner, common publisher, or common licensing agent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Notice shall identify a particular individual whom the  person responsible for the performance can contact for more detailed  information about the works covered by the blanket notice and to  determine whether a particular work planned for performance is in fact  covered by the Notice. Such identification shall include the full name  and business and residence addresses of the individual, telephone  numbers at which the individual can be reached throughout the period  between service of the notice and the performance, and name, addresses,  and telephone numbers of another individual to contact during that  period in case the first cannot be reached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the copyright owner or owners of all works covered by the  blanket notice is not identified in the Notice, the Notice shall include  an offer to identify, by name and last known address, the owner or  owners of any and all such works, upon request made to the individual  referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Notice of Objection must also include clear and prominent  statements explaining that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A failure to exclude the works identified in the Notice from the  performance in question may subject the person responsible for the  performance to liability for copyright infringement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The objection is without legal effect if there is no direct or  indirect admission charge for the performance,   and if the other conditions of 17 U.S.C. 110(4) are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Signature and identification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Notice of Objection shall be  in writing and signed by each copyright owner, or such owner's duly  authorized agent, as required by 17 U.S.C. 110(4)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The signature of each owner or agent shall be an actual  handwritten signature of an individual, accompanied by the date of  signature and the full name, address, and telephone number of that  person, typewritten or printed legibly by hand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a Notice of Objection is initially served in the form of a  telegram or similar communication, as provided by paragraph (e) of this  section, the requirement for an individual's handwritten signature shall  be considered waived if the further conditions of said paragraph (e) are  met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Notice of Objection shall be served on the person  responsible for the performance at least seven days before the date of  the performance, as provided by 17 U.S.C. 110 (4)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service of the Notice may be effected by any of the following  methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Personal service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> First-class mail;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Telegram, cablegram, or similar form of communication, if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Notice meets all of the other conditions provided by this  section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Before the performance takes place, the person responsible for  the performance receives written confirmation of the Notice, bearing the  actual handwritten signature of each copyright owner or duly authorized  agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of service is the date the Notice of Objection is  received by the person responsible for the performance or any agent or  employee of that person.
