                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual or his guardian under Sec. 21.75 shall not be  required to   show any justification or need to obtain notification under Sec. 21.42  or access to a record under Sec. 21.43.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Food and Drug Administration will determine whether a  request by an individual for records about himself is appropriately  treated as a request under this subpart, or under the provision of part  20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), or both. Where  appropriate, the Food and Drug Administration will consult with the  individual concerning the appropriate treatment of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in the Division of Freedom of  Information (address is located on the agency web site at http:// www.gov.fda) shall be responsible for the handling of Privacy Act  requests received by the Food and Drug Administration. Requests mailed  or delivered to any other office shall be promptly redirected to the FDA  Privacy Act Coordinator. Where this procedure would unduly delay the  agency's response, however, the agency employee who received the request  should consult with the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and obtain advice as  to whether the employee can respond to the request directly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon receipt of a request by the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator, a  record shall promptly be made that a request has been received and the  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A letter in accordance with Sec. 21.42 responding to the  request for notification shall issue as promptly as possible after  receipt of the request by the Food and Drug Administration. Upon  determination by the Division of Freedom of Information (address is  located on the agency web site at http://www.gov.fda) that a request for  access to records is appropriately treated as a request under part 20 of  this chapter rather than part 21, or under both parts, the time  limitations prescribed in Sec. 21.41 shall apply. In any case, access  to available records shall be provided as promptly as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 21.32, an individual's access to  records about him/herself that are retrieved by his/her name or other  personal identifiers and contained in any Privacy Act Record System may  only be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his  or her designate. An individual shall not be denied access to any record  that is otherwise available to him/her under this part except on the  grounds that it is exempt under Sec. 21.65(a)(2), that it was compiled  in reasonable anticipation of court litigation of formal administrative  proceedings, or to the extent that it is exempt or prohibited from  disclosure because it includes a trade secret or commercial or financial  information that is privileged or confidential information the  disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of  personal privacy of another individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator shall ensure that records are  maintained of the number, status, and disposition of requests under this  subpart, including the number of requests for records exempt from access  under this subpart and other information required for purposes of the  annual report to Congress under the Privacy Act. These temporary  administrative management records shall not be considered to be Privacy  Act Record Systems. All records required to be kept under this paragraph  shall only include requesting individuals' names or personal identifiers  for so long as any request for notification, access, or amendment is  pending. The identity of individuals making request under this subpart  shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be disclosed under part  20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) to any other  person or agency except as is necessary for the processing of requests  under this subpart.
