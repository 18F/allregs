                            <p class="depth0">Coverage of the provisions of part 2 of title I of the Act is determined under a multiple step process. First, the plan must be an employee benefit plan as defined under section 3(3) of the Act and Sec. 2510.3-3. (See also the definitions of employee welfare benefit plan, section 3(1) of the Act and Sec. 2510.3-1 and employe pension benefit plan, section 3(2) of the Act and Sec. 2510.3-2). Second, the employee benefit plan must be subject to title I of the Act. Coverage for title I is specified in section 4 of the Act. Third, section 201 of the Act specifies the employee benefit plans subject to title I which are not subject to the minimum standards of part 2 of title I of the Act. Section 2530.201-2 specifies the employee benefit plans subject to title I of the Act which are exempted from coverage under part 2 of title I of the Act and this part (2530).</p>
