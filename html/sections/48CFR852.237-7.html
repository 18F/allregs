                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 837.403, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Indemnification and Medical Liability Insurance (JAN 2008)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is expressly agreed and understood that this is a non- personal services contract, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the  Contractor or its health-care providers are rendered in its capacity as  an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of  professional and administrative services provided but retains no control  over professional aspects of the services rendered, including by  example, the Contractor's or its health-care providers' professional  medical judgment, diagnosis, or specific medical treatments. The  Contractor and its health-care providers shall be liable for their  liability-producing acts or omissions. The Contractor shall maintain or  require all health-care providers performing under this contract to  maintain, during the term of this contract, professional liability  insurance issued by a responsible insurance carrier of not less than the  following amount(s) per specialty per occurrence: [Contracting Officer's  Note: Insert the dollar amount value(s) of standard coverage(s)  prevailing within the local community as to the specific medical  specialty, or specialties, concerned, or such higher amount as the  Contracting Officer deems necessary to protect the Government's  interests.] However, if the Contractor is an entity or a subdivision of  a State that either provides for self-insurance or limits the liability  or the amount of insurance purchased by State entities, then the  insurance requirement of this contract shall be fulfilled by  incorporating the provisions of the applicable State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An apparently successful offeror, upon request of the  Contracting Officer, shall, prior to contract award, furnish evidence of  the insurability of the offeror and/or of all health-care providers who  will perform under this contract. The submission shall provide evidence  of insurability concerning the medical liability insurance required by  paragraph (a) of this clause or the provisions of State law as to self- insurance, or limitations on liability or insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall, prior to commencement of services under  the contract, provide to the Contracting Officer Certificates of  Insurance or insurance policies evidencing the required insurance  coverage and an endorsement stating that any cancellation or material  change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be  effective until 30 days after the insurer or the   Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer. Certificates  or policies shall be provided for the Contractor and/or each health-care  provider who will perform under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if it, or  any of the health-care providers performing under this contract, change  insurance providers during the performance period of this contract. The  notification shall provide evidence that the Contractor and/or health- care providers will meet all the requirements of this clause, including  those concerning liability insurance and endorsements. These  requirements may be met either under the new policy, or a combination of  old and new policies, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, in all subcontracts for health-care  services under this contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for  compliance by any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the  provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
