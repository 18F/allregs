Any person or entity  having knowledge of a violation or potential violation of section 274A  of the Act may submit a signed, written complaint in person or by mail  to the Service office having jurisdiction over the business or residence  of the potential violator. The signed, written complaint must contain  sufficient information to identify both the complainant and the  potential violator, including their names and addresses. The complaint  should also contain detailed factual allegations relating to the  potential violation including the date, time and place of the alleged  violation and the specific act or conduct alleged to constitute a  violation of the Act. Written complaints may be delivered either by mail  to the appropriate Service office or by personally appearing before any  immigration officer at a Service office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigation. The Service may conduct investigations for  violations on its own initiative and without having received a written  complaint. When the Service receives a complaint from a third party, it  shall investigate only those complaints that have a reasonable  probability of validity. If it is determined after investigation that  the person or entity has violated section 274A of the Act, the Service  may issue and serve a Notice of Intent to Fine or a Warning Notice upon  the alleged violator. Service officers shall have reasonable access to  examine any relevant evidence of any person or entity being  investigated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Warning notice. The Service and/or the Department of Labor may  in their discretion issue a Warning Notice to a   person or entity alleged to have violated section 274A of the Act. This  Warning Notice will contain a statement of the basis for the violations  and the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of Intent to Fine. The proceeding to assess  administrative penalties under section 274A of the Act is commenced when  the Service issues a Notice of Intent to Fine on Form I-763. Service of  this Notice shall be accomplished pursuant to part 103 of this chapter.  The person or entity identified in the Notice of Intent to Fine shall be  known as the respondent. The Notice of Intent to Fine may be issued by  an officer defined in Sec. 242.1 of this chapter with concurrence of a  Service attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contents of the Notice of Intent to Fine. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Notice of  Intent to Fine will contain the basis for the charge(s) against the  respondent, the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated, and  the penalty that will be imposed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Notice of Intent to Fine will provide the following  advisals to the respondent:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That the person or entity has the right to representation by  counsel of his or her own choice at no expense to the government;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That any statement given may be used against the person or  entity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> That the person or entity has the right to request a hearing  before an Administrative Law Judge pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554-557, and  that such request must be made within 30 days from the service of the  Notice of Intent to Fine;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> That the Service will issue a final order in 45 days if a  written request for a hearing is not timely received and that there will  be no appeal of the final order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request for Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge. If a  respondent contests the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Fine, the  respondent must file with the INS, within thirty days of the service of  the Notice of Intent to Fine, a written request for a hearing before an  Administrative Law Judge. Any written request for a hearing submitted in  a foreign language must be accompanied by an English language  translation. A request for a hearing is not deemed to be filed until  received by the Service office designated in the Notice of Intent to  Fine. In computing the thirty day period prescribed by this section, the  day of service of the Notice of Intent to Fine shall not be included. If  the Notice of Intent to Fine was served by ordinary mail, five days  shall be added to the prescribed thirty day period. In the request for a  hearing, the respondent may, but is not required to, respond to each  allegation listed in the Notice of Intent to Fine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to file a request for hearing. If the respondent does  not file a request for a hearing in writing within thirty days of the  day of service of the Notice of Intent to Fine (thirty-five days if  served by ordinary mail), the INS shall issue a final order from which  there is no appeal.
