Since there  are no other amounts carried to 1964, the unused loss deduction for 1964  is 40. Thus, after taking the unused loss deduction into account, the  mutual insurance company taxable income for 1964 is zero, and the offset  for 1964 is 5 (the mutual insurance company taxable income for 1964  determined without regard to the unused loss carryback from 1967 or any  year thereafter).</p><p class="depth0">1967 carryback to 1965: The portion of the unused loss for 1967  which is carried back to 1965 is 35 (40 minus 5, the offset for 1964).  After taking the unused loss deduction into account, the mutual  insurance company taxable income for 1965 is zero. The offset for 1965  is 10, the mutual insurance company taxable income for 1965 determined  without regard to any unused loss carryback from 1967 or any year  thereafter.</p><p class="depth0">1967 carryback to 1966: The portion of the unused loss for 1967  which is carried back to 1966 is 25. This amount is the excess of the  unused loss for 1967 of 40 over the sum of the offset for 1964 (5) and  the offset for 1965 (10). As a result of the unused loss deduction the  mutual insurance company taxable income for 1966 is reduced to zero. The  offset for 1966 is 7.</p><p class="depth0">1967 carryover to 1968: Under the provisions of section 825(d), the  portion of the unused loss for 1967 which is carried forward to 1968 is  18 (40 minus the sum of 5, 10, and 7, the offsets for 1964, 1965, and  1966, respectively). Under section 825(f)(2), this amount is first  applied against any amounts in the protection against loss account at  the end of 1968, and is then applied against the mutual insurance  company taxable income for 1968 (computed without regard to any unused  loss carryovers or carrybacks from 1967 or any taxable year thereafter).  Thus, assuming that there are no other subtractions from its protection  against loss account under section 824(d) for 1968, F's protection  against loss account of 7 is reduced to zero by reason of the  subtraction under section 824(d)(1)(C). The remaining portion of the  unused loss for 1967 which is carried to 1968, 11 (18 minus 7, the  amount of the unused loss carryover to 1968 which is subtracted from the  protection against loss account under section 824(d)(1)(C)), is then  applied against the mutual insurance company taxable income for 1968  computed without regard to any unused carryback or carryover from the  loss year (1967) or any taxable year thereafter. After the application  of the unused loss deduction for 1968, the mutual insurance company  taxable income for 1968 is zero. The offset for 1968 is 9, the sum of  the amount required to be subtracted from the protection against loss  account under section 824(d)(1)(C) for 1968 (7), plus the mutual  insurance company taxable income for 1968, determined without regard to  any unused loss carryover or carryback from 1967 or any year thereafter  (2). The remaining 9 of the unused loss for 1967 (40 minus the sum of 5,  10, 7, and 9, the offsets for 1964, 1965, 1966, and 1968, respectively),  is carried forward to 1969, and to the extent not used in that year or  any year thereafter, may be carried forward to 1970, 1971, and 1972, in  that order.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. If in example 1 F had an unused loss in 1966 of 22, then,  with respect to F's 1967 unused loss of 40, the offset for 1964 would be  zero; the offset for 1965 would be 6--the 1965 mutual insurance company  taxable income of 10 less an unused loss carryback of 4 from 1966 (the  1966 unused loss of 22 minus the 1963 offset of 13 and the 1964 offset  of 5); the offset for the loss year 1966 would be zero, and 34 (the 1967  unused loss of 40 minus the offset for 1965 of 6) would remain as an  unused loss carryover to 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, in that order.  Thus, the unused loss carrybacks or carryovers to an offset year are  applied against the mutual insurance company taxable income for such  year in the order in which the losses occurred, with the earliest loss  being offset first.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. For the taxable year 1963, M, a mutual insurance company  subject to tax imposed by section 821(a), has an unused loss (as defined  in section 825(b)) of $65,000. Under section 825(g), the loss may not be  carried back to any taxable year beginning before 1963. However, the  loss may be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years following   1963 provided that for each of such succeeding taxable years M is  subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the facts are the same as in example 3, except  that for the taxable year 1964, the gross amount received by M from the  items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof)  and premiums (including deposits and assessments) exceeds $150,000 but  does not exceed $500,000. If M does not make the election under section  821(d) (relating to election to be taxed under section 821(a)) for 1964,  M's 1963 unused loss of $65,000 will not be allowed as an unused loss  carryover or carryback since, by reason of section 825(g)(3), the unused  loss may not be carried to any taxable year if, between the loss year  and such taxable year, there is an intervening taxable year for which  the insurance company was not subject to the tax imposed by section  821(a), and by reason of section 825(g)(1), the unused loss may not be  carried to any taxable year beginning before 1963.
