                            <p class="depth0">A community, or an individual through the community, may request FEMA's comments on whether a proposed project, if built as proposed,

would justify a map revision. FEMA's comments will be issued in the form of a letter, termed a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, in accordance with 44 CFR part 72. The data required to support such requests are the same as those required for final revisions under Sec. Sec. 65.5, 65.6, and 65.7, except as-built certification is not required. All such requests shall be submitted to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC, and shall be accompanied by the appropriate payment, in accordance with 44 CFR part 72.
