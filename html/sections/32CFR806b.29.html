                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exercise caution before transmitting personal information over  e-mail to ensure it is adequately safeguarded. Some information may be  so sensitive and personal that e-mail may not be the proper way to  transmit it. When sending personal information over e-mail within DoD,  ensure: There is an official need; all addressee(s) (including ``cc''  addressees) are authorized to receive it under the Privacy Act; and it  is protected from unauthorized disclosure, loss, or alteration.  Protection methods may include encryption or password protecting the  information in a separate Word document. When transmitting personal  information over e-mail, add ``FOUO'' to the beginning of the subject  line, followed by the subject, and apply the following statement at the  beginning of the e-mail:</p><p class="depth2">``This e-mail contains For Official Use Only (FOUO) information  which must be protected under the Privacy Act and Air Force Instruction  33-332.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to e-mails. Use it  only in situations when you are actually transmitting personal  information. DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supp,   Chapter 4 \3\, provides additional guidance regarding For Official Use  Only information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/54007r_0998/ p54007r.pdf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Do not disclose personal information to anyone outside DoD  unless specifically authorized by the Privacy Act (see Sec. 806b.47).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Do not send Privacy Act information to distribution lists or  group e-mail addresses unless each member has an official need to know  the personal information. When in doubt, send only to individual  accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Before forwarding e-mails you have received that contain  personal information, verify that your intended recipients are  authorized to receive the information under the Privacy Act (see  Sec. 806b.47).</p>
