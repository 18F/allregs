Rather, a requester will be advised that these agencies have statutory obligations to audit TSP activities and that in the course of such audits they randomly sample individual TSP accounts to test for account accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-TSP Board records. An individual who wishes to know if a specific system of records maintained by the Board contains a record pertaining to him or her, or who wishes access to such records, shall address a written request to the Privacy Act Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The request letter should contain the complete name and identifying number of the pertinent system as published in the annual Federal Register notice describing the Board's Systems of Records; the full name and address of the subject individual; the subject's Social Security number if a Board employee; a brief description of the nature, time, place, and circumstances of the individual's prior association with the Board; and any other information the individual believes would help the Privacy Act Officer determine whether the information about the individual is included in the system of records. In instances where the information is insufficient to ensure disclosure to the subject individual to whom the record pertains, the Board reserves the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information. The words ``PRIVACY ACT REQUEST'' should be printed on both the letter and the envelope.
