Sec.  1208.24 through 1208.26, FHFA shall submit to the employee's paying  agency, if applicable, a certified debt claim and an installment  agreement or other instruction on the payment schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the employee is in the process of separating from the Federal  Government, FHFA shall submit its debt claim to the employee's paying  agency for collection by lump-sum deduction from the employee's final  check. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its  collection and furnish a copy of the certification to FHFA and to the  employee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the employee is already separated and all payments due from  his or her former paying agency have been paid, FHFA may, unless  otherwise prohibited, request that money due and payable to the employee  from the Federal Government, including payments from the Civil Service  Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other similar funds,  be administratively offset to collect the debt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When an employee transfers to another paying agency, FHFA  shall not repeat the procedures described in Sec.

When FHFA receives an incomplete certification  of debt from a creditor agency, FHFA shall return the claim with notice  that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed,  and that a properly certified claim must be received before FHFA will  take action to collect the debt from the employee's current pay account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. FHFA is not authorized to review the merits of the  creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity  of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another agency.  If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to FHFA, the  employee transfers to another agency before the debt is collected in  full, FHFA must certify the total amount collected on the debt as  required by 5 CFR 550.1109. One copy of the certification shall be  furnished to the employee and one copy shall be sent to the creditor  agency along with notice of the employee's transfer. If FHFA is aware  that the employee is entitled to   payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other  similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency  responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt  (including the amount) and that the requirements set forth herein and in  5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met. FHFA must submit a properly  certified claim to the new payment agency before a collection can be  made.</p>
