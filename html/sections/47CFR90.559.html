Such station identification shall be made on the  lowest frequency in the base station trunk group assigned the licensee.  Should this frequency be in use at the time station identification is  required, such identification may be made at the termination of the  communication in progress on this frequency. Identification may be made  by voice or International Morse Code. When the call sign is transmitted  in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20  words per minute and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, the  tone frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stations operating in the 769-775/799-805 MHz band that are  licensed on an exclusive basis, and normally employ digital signals for  the transmission of data, text, control codes, or digitized voice may  also be identified by digital transmission of the call sign. A licensee  that identifies its station in this manner must provide the Commission,  upon its request, information sufficient to decode the digital  transmission and ascertain the call sign transmitted.
