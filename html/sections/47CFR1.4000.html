                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any restriction, including but not limited to any state or  local law or regulation, including zoning, land-use, or building  regulations, or any private covenant, contract provision, lease  provision, homeowners' association rule or similar restriction, on  property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where  the user has a direct or indirect ownership or leasehold interest in the  property that impairs the installation, maintenance, or use of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An antenna that is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Used to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including  direct-to-home satellite service, or to receive or transmit fixed  wireless signals via satellite, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> One meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An antenna that is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Used to receive video programming services via multipoint  distribution services, including multichannel multipoint distribution  services, instructional television fixed services, and local multipoint  distribution services, or to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals  other than via satellite, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That is one meter or less in diameter or diagonal measurement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An antenna that is used to receive television broadcast  signals; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A mast supporting an antenna described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i),  (a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this section; is prohibited to the extent  it so impairs, subject to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, ``fixed wireless signals'' means  any commercial non-broadcast communications signals transmitted via  wireless technology to and/or from a fixed customer location. Fixed  wireless signals do not include, among other things, AM radio, FM radio,  amateur (``HAM'') radio, Citizen's Band (CB) radio, and Digital Audio  Radio Service (DARS) signals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, a law, regulation, or restriction  impairs installation, maintenance, or use of an antenna if it:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance, or  use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unreasonably increases the cost of installation, maintenance,  or use; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Precludes reception or transmission of an acceptable quality  signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any fee or cost imposed on a user by a rule, law, regulation or  restriction must be reasonable in light of the cost of the equipment or  services and the rule, law, regulation or restriction's treatment of  comparable devices. No civil, criminal, administrative, or other legal  action of any kind shall be taken to enforce any restriction or  regulation prohibited by this section except pursuant to paragraph (d)  or (e) of this section. In addition, except with respect to restrictions  pertaining to safety and historic preservation as described in paragraph  (b) of this section, if a proceeding is initiated pursuant to paragraph  (d) or (e) of this section, the entity seeking to enforce the antenna  restrictions in question must suspend all enforcement efforts pending  completion of review. No attorney's fees shall be collected or assessed  and no fine or other penalties shall accrue against an antenna user  while a proceeding is pending to determine the validity of any  restriction. If a ruling is issued adverse to a user, the user shall be  granted at least a 21-day grace period in which to comply with the  adverse ruling; and neither a fine nor a penalty may be collected from  the user if the user complies with the adverse ruling during this grace  period, unless the proponent of the restriction demonstrates, in the  same proceeding which resulted in the adverse ruling, that the user's  claim in the proceeding was frivolous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any restriction otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this  section is permitted if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined, legitimate  safety objective that is either stated in the text, preamble, or  legislative history of the restriction or described as applying to that  restriction in a document that is readily available to antenna users,  and would be applied to the extent practicable in a non-discriminatory  manner to other appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable  in size and weight and pose a similar or greater safety risk as these  antennas and to which local regulation would normally apply; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is necessary to preserve a prehistoric or historic district,  site, building, structure or object included in, or eligible for  inclusion on, the National Register of Historic Places, as set forth in  the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C.  470, and imposes no greater restrictions on antennas covered by this  rule than are imposed on the installation, maintenance, or use of other  modern appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable in size,  weight, and appearance to these antennas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is no more burdensome to affected antenna users than is  necessary to achieve the objectives described in paragraphs (b)(1) or  (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of an antenna that is used to transmit fixed  wireless signals, the provisions of this section shall apply only if a  label is affixed to the antenna that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provides adequate notice regarding potential radiofrequency  safety hazards, e.g., information regarding the safe minimum separation  distance required between users and transceiver antennas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> References the applicable FCC-adopted limits for radiofrequency  exposure specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Local governments or associations may apply to the Commission  for a waiver of this section under Sec. 1.3 of this chapter. Waiver  requests must comply with the procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of  this section and will be put on public notice. The Commission may grant  a waiver upon a showing by the applicant of local concerns of a highly  specialized or unusual nature. No petition for waiver shall be  considered unless it specifies the restriction at issue. Waivers granted  in accordance with this section shall not apply to restrictions amended  or enacted after the waiver is granted. Any responsive pleadings must be  served on all parties and filed within 30 days after release of a public  notice that such petition has been filed. Any replies must be filed  within 15 days thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Parties may petition the Commission for a declaratory ruling  under Sec. 1.2 of this chapter, or a court of competent jurisdiction, to  determine whether a particular restriction is permissible or prohibited  under this section. Petitions to the Commission must comply with the  procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section and will be put on  public notice. Any responsive pleadings in a Commission proceeding must  be served on all parties and filed within 30 days after release of a  public notice that such petition has been filed. Any replies in a  Commission proceeding must be served on all parties and filed within 15  days thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Copies of petitions for declaratory rulings and waivers must be  served on interested parties, including parties against whom the  petitioner seeks to enforce the restriction or parties whose  restrictions the petitioner seeks to prohibit. A certificate of service  stating on whom the petition was served must be filed with the petition.  In addition, in a Commission proceeding brought by an association or a  local government, constructive notice of the proceeding must be given to  members of the association or to the citizens under the local  government's jurisdiction. In a court proceeding brought by an  association, an association must give constructive notice of the  proceeding to its members. Where constructive notice is required, the  petitioner or plaintiff must file with the Commission or the court  overseeing the proceeding a copy of the constructive notice with a  statement explaining where the notice was placed and why such placement  was reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In any proceeding regarding the scope or interpretation of any  provision of this section, the burden of demonstrating that a particular  governmental or nongovernmental restriction complies with this section  and does not impair the installation, maintenance, or use of devices  used for over-the-air reception of video programming services or devices  used to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals shall be on the party  that seeks to impose or maintain the restriction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All allegations of fact contained in petitions and related  pleadings before the Commission must be supported by affidavit of a  person or persons with actual knowledge thereof. An original and two  copies of all petitions and pleadings should be addressed to the  Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW,  Washington, DC 20554. Copies of the petitions and related pleadings will  be available for public inspection in the Reference Information Center,  Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, Federal Communications  Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20554. Copies will be  available for purchase from the Commission's contract copy center, and  the Commission decisions will be available on the Internet.
