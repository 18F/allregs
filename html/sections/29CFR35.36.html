Such enforcement action may be taken only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other means authorized by law, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligation of the recipient created by the Act or this part; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of any requirement of, or referral to, any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any termination or refusal under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be limited to the particular recipient and to the particular program or activity found to be in violation of the Act or this part.

A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within the 60-day period or the recipient and DOL have mutually agreed to extend the time for beginning the hearing. If the hearing does not result in a finding against the recipient, the deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing.</p>
