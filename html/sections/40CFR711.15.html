For the  submission periods subsequent to the 2012 submission period, any person  who must report under this part, as described in Sec. 711.8, must  submit the information described in this section for each chemical  substance described in Sec. 711.5 that the person manufactured  (including imported) for commercial purposes in an amount of 25,000 lb  (11,340 kg) or more (or in an amount of 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) or more for  chemical substances subject to the rules, orders, or actions described  in Sec. 711.8(b)) at any one site during any calendar year since the  last principal reporting year (e.g., for the 2016 submission period,  consider calendar years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, because 2011 was the  last principal reporting year). The principal reporting year for each  submission period is the previous calendar year (e.g., the principal  reporting year for the 2016 submission period is calendar year 2015).  For all submission periods, a separate report must be submitted for each  chemical substance at each site for which the submitter is required to  report. A submitter of information under this part must report  information as described in this section to the extent that such  information is known to or reasonably ascertainable by that person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reporting information to EPA. Any person who reports information  to EPA must do so using the e-CDRweb reporting tool provided by EPA at  the address set forth in Sec. 711.35.

Other (specify). ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An indication, within each consumer and commercial product  category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, whether  the use is a consumer or a commercial use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Submitters must determine, within each consumer and commercial  product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section,  whether any amount of each reportable chemical substance manufactured  (including imported) by the submitter is present in (for example, a  plasticizer chemical substance used to make pacifiers) or on (for  example, as a component in the paint on a toy) any consumer products  intended for use by children age 14 or younger, regardless of the  concentration of the chemical substance remaining in or on the product.  Submitters must select from the following options: The chemical  substance is used in or on any consumer products intended for use by  children, the chemical substance is not used in or on any consumer  products intended for use by children, or information as to whether the  chemical substance is used in or on any consumer products intended for  use by children is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the  submitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The estimated percentage, rounded off to the closest 10%, of the  submitter's site's total production volume of the reportable chemical  substance associated with each consumer and commercial product category.  Where a particular consumer and commercial product category accounts for  less than 5% of the total production volume of a reportable chemical  substance, the percentage must not be rounded off to 0% if the  production volume attributable to that commercial and consumer product  category is 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) or more during the reporting year.  Instead, in such a case, submitters must report the percentage, rounded  off to the closest 1%, of the submitter's site's total production volume  of the reportable chemical substance associated with the particular  consumer and commercial product category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Where the reportable chemical substance is used in consumer or  commercial products, the estimated typical maximum concentration,  measured by weight, of the chemical substance in each consumer and  commercial product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of  this section. For each chemical substance in each commercial and  consumer product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this  section, submitters must select from among the ranges of concentrations  listed in Table 5 in paragraph (b)(3)(viii) of this section and report  the corresponding code (i.e., M1 through M5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Where the reportable chemical substance is used in a commercial  product, the submitter must estimate the number of commercial workers  reasonably likely to be exposed to each reportable chemical substance.  For each combination associated with each substance, the submitter must  select from among the worker ranges listed in Table 4 in paragraph  (b)(3)(vii) of this section and report the corresponding code (i.e., W1  though W8).</p>
