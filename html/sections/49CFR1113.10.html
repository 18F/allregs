                            <p class="depth0">A portion of the record before the Board in another proceeding may be offered in evidence at an oral hearing. A party making such an offer must provide, as an exhibit, a certified copy of the material sought to be introduced. A hearing officer may waive the requirement that a copy be provided, subject to such conditions as he or she may impose to assure that a copy will be available later, if needed, at no expense to the Board and to assure that the interests of other parties are not prejudiced. An offer of evidence under this section will be subject to objection by other parties.
