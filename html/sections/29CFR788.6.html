                                Sec. 788.6  Scope of the section 13(a)(13) exemption.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Employees will not be held exempt under section 13(a)(13) unless  they are clearly shown to come within its terms. (Wirtz v. F. M. Sloan  Co., 4ll F. 2d 56 (C.A. 3), 18 WH Cases 878; Gatlin Lumber Co. v.  Mitchell, 287 F. 2d 76 (C.A. 5) cert. denied, 366 U.S. 963.) By its  terms, the exemption is limited to those employed in the named  operations by an employer who employs not more than eight employees  therein. The named operations are described in terms of ordinary speech  and mean what they mean in ordinary intercourse in this context. These  operations include the incidental activities normally performed by  persons employed in them, but do not include mill operations.    Sec. 788.7  ``Planting or tending trees.''</p><p class="depth0">Employees employed in ``planting or tending trees'' include those  engaged in weeding, preparing firebreaks, removing ``seeding, planting  seedlings, pruning, rot or rusts, spraying, and similar operations when  the object is to bring about, protect, or foster the growth of trees.''  ``Tending trees'' would also include watching the timberland to guard  against thefts and fire (Gatlin Lumber Co. v. Mitchell, 287 F. 2d 76,  cert. den. 366 U.S. 963).    Sec. 788.8  ``Cruising, surveying, or felling timber.''</p><p class="depth0">Employees engaged in ``cruising * * * timber'' include all those  members of a field crew whose purpose is to estimate and report on the  volume of marketable timber. Employees engaged in ``surveying * * *  timber'' include the customary members of a crew accomplishing that  function such as the chairmen, the transit men, the rodmen, and the  axmen who clear the ground of brush or trees in order that the transit  men may obtain a clear sight. Similarly, the usual members of a crew  which go to the woods for the purpose of felling timber and preparing  and transporting logs are engaged in operations described in the  exemption. Typically included, when members of such a crew, are fellers,  limbers, skidders, buckers, loaders, swampers, scalers, and log truck  drivers.    Sec. 788.9  ``Preparing * * * logs.''</p><p class="depth0">Preparing logs includes, where appropriate, removing the limbs and  top, cutting them into lengths, removing the bark, and splitting or  facing them when done at the felling site, but does not include such  operations when done at a mill. Employees engaged in sawmill, tie mill,  and other operations in connection with the processing of logs, such as  the production of lumber, are not exempt.    Sec. 788.10  ``Preparing * * * other forestry products.''</p><p class="depth0">As used in the exemption, ``other forestry products'' mean plants of  the forest and the natural properties or substances of such plants and  trees. Included among these are decorative greens such as holly, ferns  and Christmas trees, roots, stems, leaves, Spanish moss, wild fruit, and  brush. Gathering and preparing such forestry products as well as  transporting them to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other  transportation terminal are among the described operations. Preparing  such   forestry products does not include operations which change the natural  physical or chemical condition of the products or which amount to  extracting as distinguished from gathering, such as shelling nuts, or  mashing berries to obtain juices.  [74 FR 26015, May 29, 2009]    Sec. 788.11  ``Transporting [such] products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal.''</p><p class="depth0">The transportation or movement of logs or other forestry products to  a ``mill processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal''  is among the described operations. Loading and unloading, when performed  by employees employed in the named operations, are included as exempt  operations. Loading logs or other forestry products onto railroad cars  or other transportation facilities for further shipment if performed as  part of the exempt transportation will be considered a step in the  exempt transportation (Woods Lumber Co. v. Tobin, 199 F. 2d 455  (C.A.5)). However, any other loading, transportation, or other  activities performed in connection with the logs or other forestry  products after they have been unloaded at one of the described  destinations is not exempt. ``Other transportation terminal'' refers to  any place where there are established facilities or equipment for the  shipment or transportation of logs or other forestry products. Motor  carrier yards, docks, wharves, or similar facilities are examples of  other transportation terminals, but the place where logs are picked up  by contract motor carriers or haulers at the site of the woods  operations for transportation to the mill, processing plant, or railroad  is not such a terminal.</p>
