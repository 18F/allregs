                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Any party may file an application for an order for  the taking of testimony by deposition, at any time after docketing of a  proceeding and before the close of an oral hearing or the filing of such  party's evidence in a written hearing therein. The application shall set  forth: (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name  and address of the person (referred to in this section as the  ``officer'') before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the  reasons why such deposition should be taken, which must show that it may  be able to be used as set forth in paragraph (i) of this section; (4)  whether the proposed examination is to be on interrogatories or oral;  and (5) if oral, a suggested time and place where the proposed  deposition is to be made and a suggested manner in which the proposed  deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual  telecommunication, or by personal attendance of the individuals who are  expected to participate in the deposition). The application for an order  for the taking of testimony by deposition shall be made in writing,  unless it is made orally on the record at an oral hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Response; service. If any such application is made orally on the  record at an oral hearing, each party other than the applicant, present  at such hearing, may respond to it orally. If any such application is in  writing it shall be served on each party other than the applicant, and  each such other party shall have not less than 20 days, from the date of  service on such party of the application, to file a written response to  it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written questions (interrogatories). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the examination will  be oral, parties who will not be present or represented at it may file  written questions with the officer prior to the time of the examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The presiding officer may direct, or the parties may agree, that  the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions.  If the presiding officer finds, upon the protest of a party to the  proceeding, that such party has a principal place of business or  residence more than 100 miles from the place of the examination and that  it would constitute an undue hardship on such party to be present or  represented at an oral examination at such place, the deposition, if  taken, shall be taken by means of written questions. In any such case,  the presiding officer shall state on the record at the oral hearing  that, or shall serve the parties with notice that, the deposition, if  taken, shall be taken by means of written questions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the examination is conducted by means of written questions,  copies of the applicant's questions must be received by the other party  to the proceeding and the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set  for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and any cross questions of  a party other than the applicant must be received by the applicant and  the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The presiding officer, if satisfied that good cause  for taking the deposition is present, may order the taking of the  deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The order shall be served on the parties and shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of the officer before whom the deposition  is to be made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the deponent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the deposition will be oral or on written questions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the deposition is oral, the manner in which the deposition  is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or  personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition);  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The time, which shall not be less than 20 days after the  issuance of the order, and place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The officer, time, place, and manner of the deposition as stated  in the presiding officer's order need not be the same as the officer,  time, place, and manner suggested in the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The deposition shall be conducted in the manner (telephone,  audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are  to participate in the deposition) agreed to by the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the parties cannot agree on the manner in which the  deposition is to be conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the  presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by audio- visual telecommunication:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected  to participate in the deposition; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition  shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the  presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by personal  attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the  deposition:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected  to participate in the deposition; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or  audio-visual telecommunication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Qualifications of officer. No deposition shall be made except  before an officer authorized by the law of the United States or by the  law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before an  officer authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths, or before the  presiding officer. No deposition shall be made before an officer who is  a relative (within the third degree by blood or marriage), employee,  attorney, or representative of any party (or an employee of an attorney  or representative of any party), or who is financially interested in the  result of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedure on examination. The deponent shall be examined under  oath or affirmation, and the testimony of the deponent shall be recorded  by the officer, or by some person under the direction and in the  presence of the officer. If the examination is on interrogatories, they  shall be propounded by   the officer. If the examination is oral, the deponent shall be examined  first by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken, or the  representative of such party, and shall be subject to cross-examination  by any other party or the representative thereof who is present at the  examination; the officer shall propound any interrogatories filed with  the officer by parties not present or represented at the examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certification and filing by officer. The officer shall certify  on the transcript or recording that the deponent was duly sworn by the  officer and that the transcript or recording is a true record of the  deponent's testimony, with such exceptions as the certificate shall  specify. The officer shall then securely seal the transcript or  recording, together with three copies of the transcript or recording,  with an extra copy for each party in excess of two, in an envelope, and  mail the same by registered or certified mail to the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Service; correction. After the transcript or recording is  received by the presiding officer, it shall promptly be served on all  parties. Any party, within 20 days after such service, may file a  written motion proposing corrections to the transcript or recording. Any  such motion shall be served on each party other than the one filing it,  who shall have 10 days to file a written response to it. Any such  response shall be served on each party other than the one filing it.  Such documents, if filed, shall be a part of the record of the  proceeding if any portion of the transcript or recording is made a part  of the record. All portions of the transcript or recording which are not  referred to in any such motion shall be presumed to be accurate except  for obvious typographical errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Use. If a written hearing is held, a transcript or recording, of  a deposition ordered and taken in accord with this section, may be made  a part of the record as evidence by any party, by written motion filed  with such party's evidence. If an oral hearing is held, except as  otherwise provided in these rules, such a transcript or recording may be  made a part of the record as evidence, on written motion filed by any  party, or oral motion of any party made at the oral hearing, if no party  objects after reasonable notice and opportunity to do so, or if the  presiding officer finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the witness is dead;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the witness is unable to attend or testify for any good  reason including age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the party offering the transcript or recording has tried  without success to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it  desirable, in the interests of justice and with due regard to the  importance of presenting the testimony orally before the presiding  officer, to allow the transcript or recording to be used.  If any portion of a transcript or recording of a deposition is made a  part of the record as evidence on motion of any party, any other party  may make a part of the record as evidence the remainder, or any other  portion, of the transcript or recording.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Expenses. Fees and reimbursements payable to an officer taking a  deposition, or other person recording the testimony in the deposition,  shall be paid by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Subpoenas. No subpoena can issue, to compel attendance,  testimony, or production of documentary evidence, at an examination  under this rule 9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Agreement of parties. In any case, any transcript or recording  of any deposition, or any part of such a transcript or recording, may be  made a part of the record as evidence by agreement of the parties other  than a party failing to file an answer as required in these rules.
