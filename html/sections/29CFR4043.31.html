A cash distribution is reportable if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The distribution, when combined with any other cash distributions to shareholders previously made during the fiscal year, exceeds the adjusted net income (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the person making the distribution for the preceding fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The distribution, when combined with any other cash distributions to shareholders previously made during the fiscal year or during the three prior fiscal years, exceeds the adjusted net income (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the person making

the distribution for the four preceding fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-cash distributions. A non-cash distribution is reportable if its net value (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section), when combined with the net value of any other non-cash distributions to shareholders previously made during the fiscal year, exceeds 10 percent of the total net assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section) of the person making the distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combined distributions. If both cash and non-cash distributions to shareholders are made during a fiscal year, a distribution is reportable when the sum of the cash distribution percentage (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) and the non-cash distribution percentages (as defined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section) for the fiscal year exceeds 100 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information required. In addition to the information in Sec. 4043.5(b), the notice shall include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the person making the distribution (by name and EIN); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date and amount of any cash distribution during the fiscal year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of any non-cash distribution during the fiscal year, the fair market value of each asset distributed, and the date or dates of distribution; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement as to whether the recipient was a member of the plan's controlled group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers--(1) Extraordinary dividends and stock redemptions.

Notice is waived if the person making the distribution is a de minimis 5-percent segment of the plan's controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign entity. Notice is waived if the person making the distribution is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Foreign parent. Notice is waived if the person making the distribution is a foreign parent, and the distribution is made solely to other members of the plan's controlled group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Plan funding. Notice is waived if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No variable rate premium. No variable rate premium is required to be paid for the plan for the event year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $1 million unfunded vested benefits. As of the testing date for the event year, the plan has less than $1 million in unfunded vested benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No unfunded vested benefits. As of the testing date for the event year, the plan would have no unfunded vested benefits if unfunded vested benefits were determined in accordance with the assumptions and methodology in Sec. 4010.4(b)(2) of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 80-percent funded. As of the testing date for the event year, the fair market value of the plan's assets is at least 80 percent of the plan's vested benefits amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extensions. The notice date is extended to the latest of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form 1 extension. 30 days after the plan's variable rate premium filing due date for the event year if a waiver under any of paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(iv) of this section would apply if ``the plan year preceding the event year'' were substituted for ``the event year'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign parent and foreign-linked entity. 30 days after the plan's first Form 5500 due date after the person required to notify the PBGC has actual knowledge of the distribution and the controlled group relationship, if the person making the distribution is a foreign parent or foreign-linked entity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Press releases; Forms 10Q. If the plan's contributing sponsor is a public company, 30 days after the earlier of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first Form 10Q filing deadline that occurs after the distribution; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date (if any) when a press release with respect to the distribution is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions--(1) Adjusted net income means the net income before after-tax gain or loss on any sale of assets, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjusted net income means the net income before after-tax gain or loss on any sale of assets, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cash distribution percentage means, for a fiscal year, the lesser of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The percentage that all cash distributions to one or more shareholders

made during that fiscal year bears to the adjusted net income (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the person making the distributions for the preceding fiscal year, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage that all cash distributions to one or more shareholders made during that fiscal year and the three preceding fiscal years bears to the adjusted net income (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the person making the distributions for the four preceding fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dividend means a distribution to one or more shareholders. A payment by a person to a member of its controlled group is treated as a distribution to its shareholder(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Net value of non-cash distribution means the fair market value of assets transferred by the person making the distribution, reduced by the fair market value of any liabilities assumed or consideration given by the recipient in connection with the distribution. A distribution of stock that one controlled group member holds in another controlled group member is disregarded. Net value determinations should be based on readily available fair market value(s) or independent appraisal(s) performed within one year before the distribution is made. To the extent that fair market values are not readily available and no such appraisals exist, the fair market value of an asset transferred in connection with a distribution or a liability assumed by a recipient of a distribution shall be deemed to be equal to 200 percent of the book value of the asset or liability on the books of the person making the distribution. Stock redeemed is deemed to have no value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Non-cash distribution percentage means the percentage that the net value of the non-cash distribution bears to one-tenth of the value of the total net assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section) of the person making the distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Total net assets means, with respect to the person declaring a non-cash distribution--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If all classes of the person's securities are publicly traded, the total market value (immediately before the distribution is made) of the publicly-traded securities of the person making the distribution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no classes of the person's securities are publicly traded, the excess (immediately before the distribution is made) of the book value of the person's assets over the book value of the person's liabilities, adjusted to reflect the net value of the non-cash distribution; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If some but not all classes of the person's securities are publicly traded, the greater of the amounts in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p>
