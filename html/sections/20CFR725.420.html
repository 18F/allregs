The date on which this writing is sent to the parties shall be considered the date of initial determination of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a notified operator refuses to commence payment of a claim within 30 days from the date on which an initial determination is made under this section, benefits shall be paid by the fund to the claimant in accordance with Sec. 725.522, and the operator shall be liable to the fund, if such operator is determined liable for the claim, for all benefits paid by the fund on behalf of such operator, and, in addition, such penalties and interest as are appropriate.</p>
