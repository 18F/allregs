HQ USAF/XOOBC may act on any request for civil aircraft use of an Air Force airfield. Decision authority for the following will not be delegated below HQ USAF:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of multiple Air Force airfields except as designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Those designated as 2 under Approval Authority in Table 1 to this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any unusual or unique purpose of use not specifically addressed in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Major Command, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, or Installation Commander.

Additionally, for expeditious handling of short notice requests, they may grant requests for one-time, official Government business flights that are in the best interest of the US Government and do not violate other provisions of this part. As a minimum, for one-time flights authorized under this section, the aircraft owner or operator must provide the decision authority with insurance verification and a completed DD Form 2402 before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield. Air Force authority to approve civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields on foreign soil may be limited. Commanders outside the US must be familiar with base rights agreements or other international agreements that may render inapplicable, in part or in whole, provisions of this part. Decision authority is delegated for specific purposes of use and or locations as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commander, 611th Air Operations Group (AOG). The Commander, 611th AOG or a designated representative may approve commercial charters, on a case-by-case basis, at all Air Force airfields in Alaska, except Eielson and Elmendorf AFBs, if the purpose of the charter is to transport goods and or materials, such as an electric generator or construction materials for a community center, for the benefit of remote communities that do not have adequate civil airports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Commander, AMC or a designated representative may approve permits that grant landing rights at Air Force airfields worldwide in support of AMC contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> US Defense Attache Office (USDAO). The USDAO, acting on behalf of HQ USAF/XOOBC, may grant a request for one-time landing rights at an Air Force airfield provided:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The request is for official Government business of either the US or the country to which the USDAO is accredited.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Air Force airfield is located within the country to which the USDAO is accredited.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Approval will not violate any agreement with the host country.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The installation commander concurs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The USDAO has a properly completed DD Form 2402 on file and has verified that the insurance coverage meets the requirements of Table 2 to this part, before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield.</p>
