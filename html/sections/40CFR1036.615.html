                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies how to generate advanced technology-specific emission credits for hybrid powertrains that include energy storage systems and regenerative braking (including regenerative engine braking) and for engines that include Rankine-cycle (or other bottoming cycle) exhaust energy recovery systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-transmission hybrid powertrains. Test pre-transmission hybrid powertrains with the hybrid engine test procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 or with the post-transmission test procedures in 40 CFR 1037.550. Pre-transmission hybrid powertrains are those engine systems that include features to

recover and store energy during engine motoring operation but not from the vehicle's wheels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-transmission hybrid powertrains are those engine systems that include features that recover and store energy during engine motoring operation but not from the vehicle wheels. These powertrains are tested using the hybrid engine test procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 or using the post-transmission test procedures in 40 CFR 1037.550.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Post-transmission hybrid powertrains are those powertrains that include features that recover and store energy from braking but that cannot function as hybrids without the transmission. These powertrains must have a single output shaft to the final drive and are tested by simulating the chassis test procedure applicable for hybrid vehicles under 40 CFR 1037.550. You need our approval before you begin testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rankine engines. Test engines that include Rankine-cycle exhaust energy recovery systems according to the test procedures specified in subpart F of this part unless we approve alternate procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculating credits. Calculate credits as specified in subpart H of this part. Credits generated from engines and powertrains certified under this section may be used in other averaging sets as described in Sec.  1036.740(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Innovative technologies. You may certify using both provisions of this section and the innovative technology provisions of Sec.  1036.610, provided you do not double count emission benefits.
