                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A joint venture partner is not a grantee or subgrantee  and, accordingly, is not required to comply with part 84 or part 85 of  this title in its procurement of goods and services under this part. The  partner must comply with all applicable State and local procurement and  conflict of interest requirements with respect to its selection of  entities to assist in PHA program administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. If the joint venture partner is a subsidiary,  affiliate, or identity of interest party of the PHA, it is subject to  the requirements of part 85 of this title. HUD may, on a case-by-case  basis, exempt such a joint venture partner from the need to comply with  requirements under part 85 of this title if HUD determines that the  joint venture has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting with identity-of-interest parties. A joint venture  partner may contract with an identity-of-interest party for goods or  services, or a party specified in the selected bidder's response to a  RFP or RFQ (as applicable), without the need for further procurement if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA can demonstrate that its original competitive selection  of the partner clearly anticipated the later provision of such goods or  services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compensation of all identity-of-interest parties is structured  to ensure there is no duplication of profit or expenses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA can demonstrate that its selection is reasonable based  upon prevailing market costs and standards, and that the quality and  timeliness of the goods or services is comparable to that available in  the open market. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an ``identity-of- interest party'' means a party that is wholly owned or controlled by, or  that is otherwise affiliated with, the partner or the PHA. The   PHA may use an independent organization experienced in cost valuation to  determine the cost reasonableness of the proposed contracts.</p>
