A150.1 Purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix establishes a uniform methodology for the development and preparation of airport noise exposure maps. That methodology includes a single system of measuring noise at airports for which there is a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of people to noise along with a separate single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise. It also identifies land uses which, for the purpose of this part are considered to be compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise around airports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This appendix provides for the use of the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) or an FAA approved equivalent, for developing standardized noise exposure maps and predicting noise impacts. Noise monitoring may be utilized by airport operators for data acquisition and data refinement, but is not required by this part for the development of noise exposure maps or airport noise compatibility programs. Whenever noise monitoring is used, under this part, it should be accomplished in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. A150.3 Noise descriptors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Airport Noise Measurement. The A-Weighted Sound Level, measured, filtered and recorded in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix, must be employed as the unit for the measurement of single event noise at airports and in the areas surrounding the airports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Airport Noise Exposure. The yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) must be employed for the analysis and characterization of multiple aircraft noise events and for determining the cumulative exposure of individuals to noise around airports.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. A150.5 Noise measurement procedures and equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sound levels must be measured or analyzed with equipment having the ``A'' frequency weighting, filter characteristics, and the ``slow response'' characteristics as defined in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Publication No. 179, entitled ``Precision Sound Level Meters'' as incorporated by reference in part 150 under Sec. 150.11. For purposes of this part, the tolerances allowed for general purpose, type 2 sound level meters in IEU 179, are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Noise measurements and documentation must be in accordance with accepted acoustical measurement methodology, such as those described in American National Standards Institute publication ANSI 51.13, dated 1971 as revised 1979, entitled ``ANS--Methods for the Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels''; ARP No. 796, dated 1969, entitled ``Measurement of Aircraft Exterior Noise in the Field''; ``Handbook of Noise Measurement,'' Ninth Ed. 1980, by Arnold P.G. Peterson; or ``Acoustic Noise Measurement,'' dated Jan., 1979, by J.R. Hassell and K. Zaveri. For purposes of this part, measurements intended for comparison to a State or local standard or with another transportation noise source (including other aircraft) must be reported in maximum A-weighted sound levels (LAM); for computation or validation of the yearly day-night average level (Ldn), measurements must be reported in sound exposure level (LAE), as defined in Sec. A150.205 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Part B--Noise Exposure Map Development</p><p class="depth0">Sec. A150.101 Noise contours and land usages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To determine the extent of the noise impact around an airport, airport proprietors developing noise exposure maps in accordance with this part must develop Ldn contours. Continuous contours must be developed for YDNL levels of 65, 70, and 75 (additional contours may be developed and depicted when appropriate). In those areas where YDNL values are 65 YDNL or greater, the airport operator shall identify land uses and determine land use compatibility in accordance with the standards and procedures of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Table 1 of this appendix describes compatible land use information for several land uses as a function of YDNL values. The ranges of YDNL values in Table 1 reflect the statistical variability for the responses of large groups of people to noise. Any particular level might not, therefore, accurately assess an individual's perception of an actual noise environment. Compatible or noncompatible land use is determined by comparing the predicted or measured YDNL values at a site with the values given. Adjustments or modifications of the descriptions of the land-use categories may be desirable after consideration of specific local conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compatibility designations in Table 1 generally refer to the major use of the site. If other uses with greater sensitivity to noise are permitted by local government at a site, a determination of compatibility must be based on that use which is most adversely affected by noise. When appropriate, noise level reduction through incorporation of sound attenuation into the design and construction of a structure may be necessary to achieve compatibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For the purpose of compliance with this part, all land uses are considered to be compatible with noise levels less than Ldn 65 dB. Local needs or values may dictate further delineation based on local requirements or determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in (f) below, the noise exposure maps must also contain and indentify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Runway locations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flight tracks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Noise contours of Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB resulting from aircraft operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Outline of the airport boundaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Noncompatible land uses within the noise contours, including those within the Ldn 65 dB contours. (No land use has to be identified as noncompatible if the self-generated noise from that use and/or the ambient noise from other nonaircraft and nonairport uses is equal to or greater than the noise from aircraft and airport sources.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Location of noise sensitive public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and health care facilities), and properties on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Locations of any aircraft noise monitoring sites utilized for data acquisition and refinement procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Estimates of the number of people residing within the Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB contours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Depiction of the required noise contours over a land use map of a sufficient scale and quality to discern streets and other identifiable geographic features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise exposure maps prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and which commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Flight tracks depicted on the map.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Ldn 70 dB noise contour and data related to Ldn 70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 differ between Ldn 65-70 dB and the Ldn 70-75 dB, determinations should either use the more conservative Ldn 70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Estimates of the number of people residing within the Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB contours.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Land Use Compatibility* With Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Levels----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Yearly day-night average sound level (Ldn) in decibels</p><p class="depth0">Land use            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Below 65        65-70         70-75         75-80        80-85       Over 85----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Residential</p><p class="depth0">Residential, other than mobile  Y             N(1)          N(1)          N             N            N</p><p class="depth0">homes and transient lodgings.Mobile home parks.............

B150.1 Scope and purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix prescribes the content and the methods for developing noise compatibility programs authorized under this part. Each program must set forth the measures which the airport operator (or other person or agency responsible) has taken, or proposes to take, for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map submitted by the operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of a noise compatibility program is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To promote a planning process through which the airport operator can examine and analyze the noise impact created by the operation of an airport, as well as the costs and benefits associated with various alternative noise reduction techniques, and the responsible impacted land use control jurisdictions can examine existing and forecast areas of noncompatibility and consider actions to reduce noncompatible uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To bring together through public participation, agency coordination, and overall cooperation, all interested parties with their respective authorities and obligations, thereby facilitating the creation of an agreed upon noise abatement plan especially suited to the individual airport location while at the same time not unduly affecting the national air transportation system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To develop comprehensive and implementable noise reduction techniques and land use controls which, to the maximum extent feasible, will confine severe aircraft YDNL values of Ldn 75 dB or greater to areas included within the airport boundary and will establish and maintain compatible land uses in the areas affected by noise between the Ldn 65 and 75 dB contours.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. B150.3 Requirement for noise map.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It is required that a current and complete noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per Sec. 150.21(c) be included in each noise compatibility program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To identify existing and future noncompatible land uses, based on airport operation and off-airport land uses, which have generated the need to develop a program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To identify changes in noncompatible uses to be derived from proposed program measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the proposed noise compatibility program would yield maps differing from those previously submitted to FAA, the program shall be accompanied by appropriately revised maps. Such revisions must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. A150.101(e) of appendix A and will be accepted by FAA in accordance with Sec. 150.35(f).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. B150.5 Program standards.</p><p class="depth0">Based upon the airport noise exposure and noncompatible land uses identified in the map, the airport operator shall evaluate the several alternative noise control actions and develop a noise compatibility program which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reduces existing noncompatible uses and prevents or reduces the probability of the establishment of additional noncompatible uses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Does not impose undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Provides for revision in accordance with Sec. 150.23 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Is not unjustly discriminatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Does not derogate safety or adversely affect the safe and efficient use of airspace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> To the extent practicable, meets both local needs and needs of the national air transportation system, considering tradeoffs between economic benefits derived from the airport and the noise impact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Can be implemented in a manner consistent with all of the powers and duties of the Administrator of FAA.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. B150.7 Analysis of program alternatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Noise control alternatives must be considered and presented according to the following categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Noise abatement alternatives for which the airport operator has adequate implementation authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Noise abatement alternatives for which the requisite implementation authority is vested in a local agency or political subdivision governing body, or a state agency or political subdivision governing body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Noise abatement options for which requisite authority is vested in the FAA or other Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> At a minimum, the operator shall analyze and report on the following alternatives, subject to the constraints that the strategies are appropriate to the specific airport (for example, an evaluation of night curfews is not appropriate if there are no night flights and none are forecast):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acquisition of land and interests therein, including, but not limited to air rights, easements, and development rights, to ensure the use of property for purposes which are compatible with airport operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The construction of barriers and acoustical shielding, including the soundproofing of public buildings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The implementation of a preferential runway system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The use of flight procedures (including the modifications of flight tracks) to control

the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals (or specific noise sensitive areas) to noise in the area around the airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The implementation of any restriction on the use of airport by any type or class of aircraft based on the noise characteristics of those aircraft. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Denial of use of the airport to aircraft types or classes which do not meet Federal noise standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capacity limitations based on the relative noisiness of different types of aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirement that aircraft using the airport must use noise abatement takeoff or approach procedures previously approved as safe by the FAA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Landing fees based on FAA certificated or estimated noise emission levels or on time of arrival; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Partial or complete curfews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other actions or combinations of actions which would have a beneficial noise control or abatement impact on the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other actions recommended for analysis by the FAA for the specific airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For those alternatives selected for implementation, the program must identify the agency or agencies responsible for such implementation, whether those agencies have agreed to the implementation, and the approximate schedule agreed upon.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. B150.9 Equivalent programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise compatibility programs prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Flight tracks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A noise contour of Ldn 70 dB resulting from aircraft operations and data related to the Ldn 70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 of appendix A differ between Ldn 65-70 dB and Ldn 70-75 dB, the determinations should either use the more conservative Ldn 70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The categorization of alternatives pursuant to Sec. B150.7(a), although the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program must still be identified in accordance with Sec. 150.23(e)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Previously prepared noise compatibility program documentation may be supplemented to include these and other program requirements which have not been excepted.</p>
