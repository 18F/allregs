A complement C1 inhibitor  (inactivator) immunological test system is a device that consists of the  reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the complement  C1 inhibitor (a plasma protein) in serum. Complement  C1 inhibitor occurs normally in plasma and blocks the action  of the C1 component of complement (a group of serum proteins  which destroy infectious agents). Measurement of complement  C1 inhibitor aids in the diagnosis of hereditary  angioneurotic edema (increased blood vessel permeability causing  swelling of tissues) and a rare form of angioedema associated with  lymphoma (lymph node cancer).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
