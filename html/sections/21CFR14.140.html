                            <p class="depth0">The Commissioner will establish a color additive advisory committee  under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it  would be in the public interest for a color additive advisory committee  to review and make recommendations about the safety of a color additive  on which important issues are pending before FDA and for interested  persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing  before a color additive advisory committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(5)(B)</em> of the FD&C;  Act concerning the safety of a color additive, including its potential  or actual carcinogenicity, that requires the exercise of scientific  judgment and a person who would be adversely affected by the issuance,  amendment, or repeal of a regulation listing a color additive requests  that the matter, or the Commissioner as a matter of discretion  determines that the matter should, be referred to a color additive  advisory committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (b) does not apply to any issue arising under the  transitional provisions in section 203 of the Color Additive Amendments  of 1960 relating to provisional listing of commercially established  colors. A color   additive advisory committee to consider any such matter will be  established under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for establishment of a color additive advisory  committee is to be made in accordance with Sec. 10.30. The Commissioner  may deny any petition if inadequate grounds are stated for establishing  a color additive advisory committee. A request for establishment of a  color additive advisory committee may not rest on mere allegations or  denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a  genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires scientific judgment  and justifies a hearing before a color additive advisory committee. When  it conclusively appears from the request for a color additive advisory  committee that the matter is premature or that it does not involve an  issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C; Act or that there  is no genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring scientific  judgment, or for any other reason a color additive advisory committee is  not justified, the Commissioner may deny the establishment of a color  additive advisory committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishment of a color additive advisory committee on the  request of an interested person is conditioned upon receipt of the  application fee specified in Sec. 14.155.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any person adversely affected may request referral of the matter  to a color additive advisory committee at any time before, or within 30  days after, publication of an order of the Commissioner acting upon a  color additive petition or proposal.</p>
