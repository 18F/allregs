Furthermore, EPA requests, but does not require, that the submitter also  provide a second copy of its submittal from which all confidential  information has been deleted.

This rule will provide guidance to vehicle  and engine manufacturers to better enable them to submit acceptable  remedial plans.</p><p class="depth2">Section 207(c)(1) requires the Administrator to base a recall order  on a determination that a substantial number of in-use vehicles or  engines within a given class or category of vehicles or engines,  although properly maintained and used, fail to conform to the  regulations prescribed under section 202 when in actual use throughout  their useful lives. After making such a determination, he shall require  the manufacturer to submit a plan to remedy the nonconformity of any  such vehicles or engines. The plan shall provide that the manufacturer  will remedy, at the manufacturer's expense, all properly maintained and  used vehicles which experienced the nonconformity during their useful  lives regardless of their age or mileage at the time of repair.
