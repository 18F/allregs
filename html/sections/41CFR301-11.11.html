                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must make your lodging reservations through your agency's travel management service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You should always stay in a ``fire safe'' facility. This is a facility that meets the fire safety requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (the Act), as amended (see 5 U.S.C. 5707a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When selecting a commercial lodging facility, first consideration should be given to government lodging agreement programs such as FedRooms[supreg] (http://www.fedrooms.com). The advantages of obtaining lodging using the FedRooms[supreg] program are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lodging rates are set at or below per diem rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are no add-on fees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The room cancellation deadline is 4 p.m. (or later) on the day of arrival;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Most hotels offer last standard room availability rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> There are no early departure fees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rates are available using all booking channels (e.g., E-Gov Travel Service, Travel Management Service, FedRooms[supreg] Web site, and hotel reservation call centers). The FedRooms[supreg] rate code (XVU) must be entered to get the program benefits.</p><p class="depth3">Note to Sec.  301-11.11: 5 U.S.C. 5707a does not apply to the District of Columbia government.
