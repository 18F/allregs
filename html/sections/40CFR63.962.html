                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator subject to this subpart shall control air emissions from the individual drain system using one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Covers, water seals, and other air emission control equipment as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hard-piping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Venting of the individual drain system through a closed vent system to a control device in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual drain system is designed and operated such that an internal pressure in the vapor headspace in the system is maintained at a level less than atmospheric pressure when the control device is operating, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The closed vent system and control device are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  63.693 in 40 CFR part 63, subpart DD--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant Standards from Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Owners and operators controlling air emissions from an individual drain system in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual drain system shall be designed to segregate the organic vapors from regulated material managed in the controlled individual drain system from entering any other individual drain system that is not controlled for air emissions in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Drain control requirements. Each drain shall be equipped with either a water seal or a closure device in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When a water seal is used, the water seal shall be designed such that either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The outlet to the pipe discharging the regulated-material extends below the liquid surface in the water seal of the drain; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A flexible shield or other device is installed which restricts wind motion across the open space between the outlet of the pipe discharging the regulated material and the drain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a closure device is used (e.g., securing a cap or plug on a drain

that is not receiving regulated-material), the closure device shall be designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the drain opening and the closure device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Junction box control requirements. Each junction box shall be equipped with controls as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The junction box shall be equipped with a closure device (e.g., manhole cover, access hatch) that is designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the junction box opening and the closure device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the junction box is vented, the junction box shall be vented in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The junction box shall be vented through a closed vent system to a control device except as provided for in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. The closed vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the standards specified in Sec.  63.693.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As an alternative to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the owner or operator may vent the junction box directly to the atmosphere when all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The junction box is filled and emptied by gravity flow (i.e., there is no pump) or is operated with no more than slight fluctuations in the liquid level. Large changes in the size of the junction box vapor headspace created by using a pump to repeatedly empty and then refill the junction box do not meet this condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The vent pipe installed on the junction box shall be at least 90 centimeters in length and no greater than 10 centimeters in nominal inside diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Water seals are installed at the liquid entrance(s) to or exit from the junction box to restrict ventilation in the individual drain system and between components in the individual drain system. The owner or operator shall demonstrate (e.g., by visual inspection or smoke test) upon request by the Administrator that the junction box water seal is properly designed and restricts ventilation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sewer line control requirements. Each sewer line shall not be open to the atmosphere and shall be covered or closed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the sewer line joints, seals, or other emission interfaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Operating requirements. The owner or operator shall operate the air emission controls required by paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each closure device shall be maintained in a closed position whenever regulated-material is in the individual drain system except when it is necessary to remove or open the closure device for sampling or removing material in the individual drain system, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each drain equipped with a water seal and open to the atmosphere shall be operated to ensure that the liquid in the water seal is maintained at the appropriate level. Examples of acceptable means for complying with this provision include but are not limited to using a flow-monitoring device indicating positive flow from a main to a branch water line supplying a trap; continuously dripping water into the trap using a hose; or regular visual observations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each closed-vent system and the control device used to comply with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall be operated in accordance with the standards specified in 40 CFR 63.693.
