                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is hereby found necessary in the interest of national defense  to waive compliance with the navigation and vessel inspection laws  administered by the Coast Guard, as well as the regulations issued  thereunder and published in 33 CFR chapter I or in this chapter, to the  extent and in the manner and upon the terms and conditions as set forth  in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application requesting that a waiver be made effective, with  respect to a particular vessel, may be made by any authorized  representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other  interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel  involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the  application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to  the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative  at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a  vessel in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to  the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place,  or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or  place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a  port or place where such facilities have been established. Every  application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of  law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a  certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect  to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense  and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The  Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the  designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall  promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining  whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the  waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In  any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer   concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action  would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to  the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred.  In all other cases, such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate  consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that  the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then  such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the  extent and under the circumstances specified by him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant  to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in  triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the  laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is  effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also  regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver  shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be  delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails.  In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be  delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay.  One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the  remaining copy kept on file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may  be made orally, and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his  designated representative or the designated representative of the  Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in  paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective  without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be  reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of  the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective  shall specify in the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with  any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has  been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.
