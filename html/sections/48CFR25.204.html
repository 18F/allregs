In the case of a tie, the  contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does not  include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the  offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of  equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of  the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception  permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not  apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that  proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable  clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(2) of 52.225-9, or paragraph  (b)(3) of 52.225-11), the contracting officer must add the excepted  materials to the list in the contract clause.
