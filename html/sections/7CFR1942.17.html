                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section includes information and procedures  specifically designed for use by applicants, including their  professional consultants and/or agents who provide such assistance and  services as architectural, engineering, financial, legal, or other  services related to application processing and facility planning and  development. This section is made available as needed for such use. It  includes FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 policies  and requirements pertaining to loans for community facilities. It  provides applicants with guidance for use in proceeding with their  application. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall  cooperate fully with appropriate State agencies to give maximum support  of the State's strategies for development of rural areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. Financial assistance to areas or communities  adjacent to, or closely associated with, nonrural areas is limited by  Sec. 1942.17(c) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicant. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A public body, such as a municipality, county,  district, authority, or other political subdivision of a state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Loans for water or waste disposal facilities will not be made to  a city or town with a population in excess of 10,000 inhabitants,  according to the latest decennial Census of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Loans for essential community facilities will not be made to a  city or town with a population in excess of 20,000 inhabitants according  to the latest decennial Census of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis, such as an  association, cooperative, and private corporation. Applicants organized  under the general profit corporation laws may be eligible if they  actually will be operated on a not-for-profit basis under their charter,  bylaws, mortgage, or supplemental agreement provisions as may be  required as a condition of loan approval. Essential community facility  applicants other than utility-type must have significant ties with the  local rural community. Such ties are necessary to ensure to the greatest  extent possible that a facility under private control will carry out a  public purpose and continue to primarily serve rural areas. Ties may be  evidenced by items such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Association with or controlled by a local public body or bodies,  or broadly based ownership and controlled by members of the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Substantial public funding through taxes, revenue bonds, or  other local Government sources, and/or substantial voluntary community  funding, such as would be obtained through a community-wide funding  campaign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other  Federally recognized Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facilities must be located in rural areas, except  for utility-type services such as water, sewer, natural gas, or  hydroelectric, serving both rural and non-rural areas. In such cases,  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds may be used  to finance only that portion serving rural areas, regardless of facility  location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Essential community facilities must primarily serve rural  areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For water or waste disposal facilities, the terms rural and  rural area will not include any area in any city or town with a  population in excess of 10,000 inhabitants, according to the latest  decennial Census of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For essential community facilities, the terms rural and rural  area will not include any area in any city or town with a population in  excess of 20,000 inhabitants, according to the latest decennial Census  of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit elsewhere. Applicants must certify in writing and FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall determine and  document that the applicant is unable to finance the proposed project  from their own resources or through commercial credit at reasonable  rates and terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Legal authority and responsibility. Each applicant must have or  will obtain the legal authority necessary for   constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed facility or  service and for obtaining, giving security for, and repaying the  proposed loan. The applicant shall be responsible for operating,  maintaining, and managing the facility, and providing for its continued  availability and use at reasonable rates and terms. This responsibility  shall be exercised by the applicant even though the facility may be  operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract,  management agreement, or written lease. Leases may be used when this is  the only feasible way to provide the service and is the customary  practice. Management agreements should provide for at least those items  listed in guide 24 of this subpart (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Such contracts,  management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other  provisions for transfer of ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Refinancing FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 debt. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall  require an agreement that if at any time it shall appear to the  Government that the borrower is able to refinance the amount of the  indebtedness then outstanding, in whole or in part, by obtaining a loan  for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private credit  sources, at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes  and periods of time, the borrower will, upon request of the Government,  apply for and accept such loan in sufficient amount to repay the  Government and will take all such actions as may be required in  connection with such loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Expanded eligibility for timber-dependent communities in Pacific  Northwest. In the Pacific Northwest, defined as an area containing  national forest covered by the Federal document entitled, ``Forest Plan  for a Sustainable Economy and a Sustainable Environment,'' dated July 1,  1993; the population limits contained Sec. 1942.17(b) are expanded to  include communities with not more than 25,000 inhabitants until  September 30, 1998, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Part or all of the community lies within 100 miles of the  boundary of a national forest covered by the Federal document entitled,  ``Forest Plan for a Sustainable Economy and a Sustainable Environment,''  dated July 1, 1993; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The community is located in a county in which at least 15  percent of the total primary and secondary labor and proprietor income  is derived from forestry, wood products, or forest-related industries  such as recreation and tourism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Priorities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Truly rural areas. FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 program assistance will be directed toward  truly rural areas and rural communities. Normally, priority will not be  given to preapplications for projects that will serve other than truly  rural areas. Truly rural areas are areas other than densely settled  areas or communities adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or  town with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water or waste  disposal assistance, or 20,000 residents for essential community  facility assistance. When determining whether a rural area or rural  community is adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or town  with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water and waste  disposal, or 20,000 residents for essential community facility  assistance, minor open spaces such as those created by physical or legal  barriers, commercial or industrial development, parks, areas reserved  for convenience or appearance, or narrow strips of cultivated land, will  be disregarded. An area or community shall be considered adjacent to or  closely related with a nonrural area when it constitutes for general,  social, and economic purposes a single community having a contiguous  boundary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Project selection process. The following paragraphs indicate  items and conditions which must be considered in selecting  preapplications for further development. When ranking eligible  preapplications for consideration for limited funds, FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 officials must consider the  priority items met by each preapplication and the degree to which those  priorities are met, and apply good judgement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preapplications. The preapplication and supporting information  submitted   with it will be used to determine the proposed project's priority for  available funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State Office review. All preapplications will be reviewed and  scored and Form AD-622, ``Notice of Preapplication Review Action,''  issued within the time limits in Sec. 1942.2(a)(2)(iv) of this subpart.  When considering authorizing the development of an application for  funding, the State Director should consider the remaining funds in the  State allocation, and the anticipated allocation of funds for the next  fiscal year as well as the amount of time necessary to complete that  application. Applicants whose preapplications are found to be ineligible  will be so advised. These applicants will be given adverse notice  through Form AD-622 and advised of their appeal rights under subpart B  of part 1900 of this chapter. Those applicants with eligible lower  scoring preapplications which obviously cannot be funded within an  eighteen month period of time, and are not within 150 percent of the  State's allocation, should be notified that funds are not available; and  requested to advise whether they wish to have their preapplication  maintained in an active file for future consideration. The State  Director may request an additional allocation of funds from the National  Office for such preapplications. Such requests will be considered along  with all others on hand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Selection priorities. The priorities described below will be  used by the State Director to rate preapplications. The priorities  should be applied to water and waste disposal or community facilities  preapplications as directed. The format found in part I of guide 26 of  this subpart should be followed in scoring each preapplication. A copy  of the score sheet should be placed in the case file for future  reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Population priorities. The following priorities apply to both  Water and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities preapplications.  Points will be distributed as indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proposed project is located in a rural community having a  population not in excess of 2,500--25 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em> (A)(1) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Health priorities. Points will be distributed as indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Water and Waste Disposal preapplications only. The proposed  project is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Needed to alleviate the sudden unexpected diminution or  deterioration of a water supply, or to meet health or sanitary standards  which pertain to a community's water supply--25 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Required to correct an inadequate waste disposal system due to  unexpected occurrences, or to meet health or sanitary standards which  pertain to a community's waste disposal system--25 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Community Facility preapplication only. The proposed project is  required either to correct a health or sanitary problem, or to meet a  health or sanitary standard--25 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Income priorities. The following priorities apply to both Water  and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities preapplications. Points will  be distributed as indicated. The median income of the population to be  served by the proposed facility is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Less than the poverty line for a family of four, as defined in  Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C.  9902(2)), or less than 80 percent of the statewide nonmetropolitan  median household income--25 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Equal to or more than the poverty line and between 80% and 100%,  inclusive, of the State's nonmetropolitan median household income--20  points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other factors. Points will be distributed as indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Water and Waste Disposal preapplications only. The proposed  project will: merge ownership, management, and operation of smaller  facilities providing for more efficient management and economical  service; and/or enlarge, extend, or otherwise modify existing facilities  to provide service to additional rural residents--10 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Community Facilities preapplications only. The purpose of the  proposed project is to construct, enlarge, extend or otherwise improve  the following types of facilities. (Select only the factor most  applicable to the proposed project.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Public safety--10 points. (Examples include police services and  fire, rescue and ambulance services as authorized by subpart C of this  part 1942.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Health care--5 points. (Examples include clinics, nursing  homes, convalescent facilities, and hospital projects designed to make  the facility conform with life/safety codes, medicare and medicaid  requirements, and minor expansions needed to meet the immediate  requirements of the community. Points under this authority should not be  awarded to a preapplication if points were awarded under  Sec. 1942.17(c)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Water and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities  preapplications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicant is a public body or Indian tribe--5 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Project is located in a ``truly rural area'' as described in  Sec. 1942.17(c)(1) of this subpart--10 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount of joint financing committed to the project is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 20% or more private, local or state funds except federal funds  channeled through a state agency--10 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> 5%-19% private, local or state funds except federal funds  channeled through a state agency--5 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In certain cases the State Director may assign up to 15 points  to a preapplication, in addition to those that may be scored under  paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (A) through (D), of this section. These points  are primarily intended to address an unforeseen exigency or emergency,  such as the loss of a community facility due to accident or natural  disaster or the loss of joint financing if FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 funds are not committed in a timely fashion.  However, the points may also be awarded to projects in order to improve  compatibility/coordination between FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354's and other agencies' selection systems and to assist  those projects that are the most cost effective. A written justification  must be prepared and placed in the project file each time the State  Director assigns these points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this subpart. Priority will  be given to those preapplications and applications for funding which  meet criteria in Sec. 1942.17(c)(2)(iii)(A) (1) or (2); and the criteria  in Sec. 1942.17(c) (2)(iii)(B)(1) (i) or (ii) or (B)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application development. Applications should be developed  expeditiously following good management practices. Applications that are  not developed in a reasonable period of time taking into account the  size and complexity of the   proposed project may be removed from the State's active file. Applicants  will be consulted prior to taking such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Project obligations. To ensure efficient use of resources,  obligations should occur in a timely fashion throughout the fiscal year.  Projects may be obligated as their applications are completed and  approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Requests for additional funding. All requests for additional  allocations of funds submitted to the National Office must follow the  formats found in parts I and II of guide 26. In selecting projects for  funding at the National Office level, additional points may be scored  based on the priority assigned to the project by the State Office. These  points will be scored in the manner shown below. Only the three highest  priority projects can score points. In addition, the Administrator may  assign up to 15 additional points to account for items such as  geographic distribution of funds and emergency conditions caused by  economic problems or natural disasters.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Priority                              Points ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.......................................................               5 2.......................................................               3 3.......................................................               1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Cost overruns. A preapplication may receive consideration for  funding before others at the State Office level or at the National  Office level, if funds are not available in the State Office, when it is  a subsequent request for a previously approved project which has  encountered cost overruns due to high bids or unexpected construction  problems that cannot be reduced by negotiations, redesign, use of bid  alternatives, rebidding or other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligible loan purposes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Funds may be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To construct, enlarge, extend, or otherwise improve water or  waste disposal and other essential community facilities providing  essential service primarily to rural residents and rural businesses.  Rural businesses would include facilities such as educational and other  publicly owned facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Water or waste disposal facilities include water, sanitary  sewerage, solid waste disposal, and storm waste-water facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Essential community facilities are those public improvements  requisite to the beneficial and orderly development of a community  operated on a nonprofit basis including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Health services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Community, social, or cultural services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transportation facilities, such as streets, roads, and bridges;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hydroelectric generating facilities and related connecting  systems and appurtenances, when not eligible for Rural Electrification  Administration (REA) financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Supplemental and supporting structures for other rural  electrification or telephone systems (including facilities such as  headquarters and office buildings, storage facilities, and maintenance  shops) when not eligible for Rural Electrification Administration  financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Natural gas distribution systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Industrial park sites, but only to the extent of land  acquisition and necessary site preparation, including access ways and  utility extensions to and throughout the site. Funds may not be used in  connection with industrial parks to finance on-site utility systems, or  business and industrial buildings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Otherwise improve includes but is not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The purchase of major equipment, such as solid waste collection  trucks and X-ray machines, which will in themselves provide an essential  service to rural residents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The purchase of existing facilities when it is necessary either  to improve or to prevent loss of service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment of tap fees and other utility connection charges as  provided in utility purchase contracts prepared under Sec. 1942.18(f) of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To construct or relocate public buildings, roads, bridges,  fences, or utilities, and to make other public improvements necessary to  the successful operation or protection of facilities authorized in  paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To relocate private buildings, roads, bridges, fences, or  utilities, and other private improvements necessary   to the successful operation or protection of facilities authorized in  paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To pay the following expenses, but only when such expenses are  a necessary part of a loan to finance facilities authorized in  paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reasonable fees and costs such as legal, engineering,  architectural, fiscal advisory, recording, environmental impact  analyses, archeological surveys and possible salvage or other mitigation  measures, planning, establishing or acquiring rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interest on loans until the facility is self-supporting, but not  for more than three years unless a longer period is approved by the  National Office; interest on loans secured by general obligation bonds  until tax revenues are available for payment, but not for more than two  years unless a longer period is approved by the National Office; and  interest on interim financing, including interest charges on interim  financing from sources other than FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Costs of acquiring interest in land; rights, such as water  rights, leases, permits, rights-of-way; and other evidence of land or  water control necessary for development of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Purchasing or renting equipment necessary to install, maintain,  extend, protect, operate, or utilize facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Initial operating expenses for a period ordinarily not exceeding  one year when the borrower is unable to pay such expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Refinancing debts incurred by, or on behalf of, a community when  all of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The debts being refinanced are a secondary part of the total  loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The debts are incurred for the facility or service being  financed or any part thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arrangements cannot be made with the creditors to extend or  modify the terms of the debts so that a sound basis will exist for  making a loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Prepay costs for which FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 grant funds were obligated provided there is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No conflict with the loan resolution, State statutes, or any  other loan requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full documentation showing that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Loan funds will only be utilized on a temporary basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan  funds are restored at a later date for purpose(s) for which they were  obligated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> To pay obligations for construction incurred before loan  approval. Construction work should not be started and obligations for  such work or materials should not be incurred before the loan is  approved. However, if there are compelling reasons for proceeding with  construction before loan approval, applicants may request FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval to pay such  obligations. Such requests may be approved if FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before loan  approval; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The obligations will be incurred for authorized loan purposes;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contract documents have been approved by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All environmental requirements applicable to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the applicant have been  met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The applicant has the legal authority to incur the obligations  at the time proposed, and payment of the debts will remove any basis for  any mechanic, material, or other liens that may attach to the security  property. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may  authorize payment of such obligations at the time of loan closing. FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's authorization to pay  such obligations, however, is on the condition that it is not committed  to make the loan; it assumes no responsibility for any obligations  incurred by the applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all  loan approval requirements. The applicant's request and FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 authorization for paying such  obligations shall be in writing. If construction is started without FmHA  or its   successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval, post approval in  accordance with this section may be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Funds may not be used to finance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On-site utility systems or business and industrial buildings in  connection with industrial parks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Facilities to be used primarily for recreation purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Community antenna television services or facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Electric generation or transmission facilities or telephone  systems, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(4), or  (d)(1)(i)(B)(5) of this section; or extensions to serve a particular  essential community facility as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or  (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Facilities which are not modest in size, design, and cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Loan or grant finder's fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Projects located within the Coastal Barriers Resource System  that do not qualify for an exception as defined in section 6 of the  Coastal Barriers Resource Act, Pub.

All facilities financed under the  provisions of this subpart shall be for public use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Utility-type service facilities will be installed so as to serve  any user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly  and legally served. Applicants and borrowers must obtain written  concurrence of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  prior to refusing service to such user. Upon failure to provide service  which is reasonable and legal, such user shall have direct right of  action against the applicant/borrower. A notice of the availability of  this service should be given by the applicant/borrower to all persons  living within the area who can feasibly and legally be served by the  phase of the project being financed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a mandatory hookup ordinance will be adopted, the required  bond ordinance or resolution advertisement will be considered adequate  notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When any portion of the income will be derived from user fees  and a mandatory hookup ordinance will not be adopted, each potent user  will be afforded an opportunity to request service by signing a Users  Agreement.   Those declining service will be afforded an opportunity to sign a  statement to such effect. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 has guides available for these purposes in all FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In no case will boundaries for the proposed service area be  chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of  race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or national  origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This does not preclude:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not  practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Financing or constructing facilities where it is not  economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic  feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system and not by  considering the cost of separate extensions to or parts thereof; the  applicant publicly announces a plan for extending service to areas not  initially receiving service from the system; and potential users located  in the areas not to be initially served receive written notice from the  applicant that service will not be provided until such time as it is  economically feasible to do so, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Extending services to industrial areas when service is made  available to users located along the extensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The State Director will determine that, when feasibly and  legally possible, inequities within the proposed project's service area  for the same type service proposed (i.e., water or waste disposal) will  be remedied by the owner on or before completion of the project that  includes FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funding.  Inequities are defined as flagrant variations in availability, adequacy  or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing  systems that were developed under different financing, rates, terms or  conditions, as determined by the State Director, do not necessarily  constitute inequities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Before a loan is made to an applicant other than a public body,  for other than utility type projects, the articles of incorporation or  loan agreement will include a condition similar to the following:</p><p class="depth0">In the event of dissolution of this corporation, or in the event it  shall cease to carry out the objectives and purposes herein set forth,  all business, property, and assets of the corporation shall go and be  distributed to one or more nonprofit corporations or public bodies as  may be selected by the board of directors of this corporation and  approved by at least 75 percent of the users or members to be used for,  and devoted to, the purpose of a community facility project or other  purpose to serve the public welfare of the community. In no event shall  any of the assets or property, in the event of dissolution thereof, go  or be distributed to members, directors, stockholders, or others having  financial or managerial interest in the corporation either for the  reimbursement of any sum subscribed, donated or contributed by such  members or for any other purposes, provided that nothing herein shall  prohibit the corporation from paying its just debts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rates and terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Each loan will bear interest at  the rate prescribed in RD Instruction 440.1, exhibit B (available in any  Rural Development office). The interest rates will be set by Rural  Development at least for each quarter of the fiscal year. All rates will  be adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent. The applicant may  submit a written request prior to loan closing that the interest rate  charged on the loan be the lower of the rate in effect at the time of  loan approval or the rate in effect at the time of loan closing. If the  interest rate is to be that in effect at loan closing, the interest rate  charged on a loan involving multiple advances of Rural Development  funds, using temporary debt instruments, shall be that in effect on the  date when the first temporary debt instrument is issued. If no written  request is received from the applicant prior to loan closing, the  interest rate charged on the loan will be the rate in effect at the time  of loan approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of  this section do not apply to health care and related facilities that  provide direct health care to the public. Otherwise, all loans must  comply with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The primary purpose of the loan is to upgrade existing  facilities or construct new facilities required to meet applicable  health or sanitary standards. Documentation will be obtained from the  appropriate regulatory agency with jurisdiction to establish the  standard, to verify that a bonafide standard exists, what that standard  is, and that the proposed improvements are needed and required to meet  the standard; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The median household income of the service area is below the  poverty line for a family of four, as defined in section 673(2) of the  Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), or below 80  percent of the Statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Intermediate rate. The intermediate interest rate will be set at  the poverty line rate plus one-half of the difference between the  poverty line rate and the market rate, not to exceed 7 percent per  annum. It will apply to loans that do not meet the requirements for the  poverty line rate and for which the median household income of the  service area is below the poverty line or not more than 100 percent of  the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Market rate. The market interest rate will be set using as  guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index for the four weeks prior to  the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter.  The market rate will apply to all loans that do not qualify for a  different rate under paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section. It may  be adjusted as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prime farmland. For essential community facilities loans, the  rate indicated by paragraphs (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section  will be increased by two per centum per annum if the project being  financed will involve the use of, or construction on, prime or unique  farmland in accordance with FmHA Instruction 440.1, exhibits B and J  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  office).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Income determination. The income data used to determine median  household income should be that which most accurately reflects the  income of the service area. The service area is that area reasonably  expected to be served by the facility being financed by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The median household income  of the service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income of  the State will be determined from income data from the most recent  decennial census of the U.S. If there is reason to believe that the  census data is not an accurate representation of the median household  income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented and  the applicant may furnish, or FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 may obtain, additional information regarding such median  household income. Information will consist of reliable data from local,  regional, State or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a  reliable impartial source. The nonmetropolitan median household income  of the State may only be updated on a national basis by the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National Office. This will be  done only when median household income data for the same year for all  Bureau of the Census areas is available from the Bureau of the Census or  other reliable sources. Bureau of the Census areas would include areas  such as: Counties, County Subdivisions, Cities, Towns, Townships,  Boroughs, and other places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Repayment terms. The loan repayment period shall not exceed the  useful life of the facility, State statute or 40 years from the date of  the note(s) or bond(s), whichever is less. Where FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 grant funds are used in connection with  an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan, the loan  will be for the maximum term permitted by this subpart, State statute,  or the useful life of the facility, whichever is less, unless there is  an exceptional case where circumstances justify making an FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan for less than the maximum  term permitted. In such cases, the reasons must be fully documented. In  all cases, including those in which the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 is jointly financing with another lender, the  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 payments of  principal and interest should approximate amortized installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Principal payments may be deferred in whole or in part for a  period not to exceed 36 months following the date the first interest  installment is due. If for any reason it appears necessary to permit a  longer period of deferment, the State Director may authorize such  deferment with the prior approval of the National Office. Deferments of  principal will not be used to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Postpone the levying of taxes or assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Delay collection of the full rates which the borrower has agreed  to charge users for its services as soon as major benefits or the  improvements are available to those users.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Create reserves for normal operation and maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Make any capital improvements except those approved by FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determined to be essential  to the repayment of the loan or to the obtaining of adequate security  thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Accelerate the payment of other debts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment date. Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with  income availability and be in accordance with State law. If consistent  with the foregoing, monthly payments will be required and will be  enumerated in the bond, other evidence of indebtedness, or other  supplemental agreement. However, if State law only permits principal  plus interest (P&I;) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be  used. Insofar as practical monthly payments will be scheduled one full  month following the date of loan closing; or semiannual or annual  payments will be scheduled six or twelve full months, respectively,  following the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates  falling on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of the month will be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Security. Loans will be secured by the best security position  practicable   in a manner which will adequately protect the interest of FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 during the repayment period of  the loan. Specific requirements for security for each loan will be  included in a letter of conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Joint financing security. For projects utilizing joint  financing, when adequate security of more than one type is available,  the other lender may take one type of security with FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 taking another type. For  projects utilizing joint financing with the same security to be shared  by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and another  lender, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  obtain at least a parity position with the other lender. A parity  position is to ensure that with joint security, in the event of default,  each lender will be affected on a proportionate basis. A parity position  will conform with the following unless an exception is granted by the  National Office:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terms. It is not necessary for loans to have the same repayment  terms to meet the parity requirements. Loans made by other lenders  involved in joint financing with FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 for facilities should be scheduled for repayment on  terms similar to those customarily used in the State for financing such  facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use of trustee or other similar paying agent. The use of a  trustee or other similar paying agent by the other lender in a joint  financing arrangement is acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354. A trustee or other similar paying agent will  not normally be used for the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 portion of the funding unless required to comply with State  law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other  similar paying agent on projects that include FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 funds must be clearly specified by  written agreement and approved by the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 State Director and Regional Attorney. FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must be able to deal directly  with the borrower to enforce the provisions of loan and grant agreements  and perform necessary servicing actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Regular payments. In the event adequate funds are not  available to meet regular installments on parity loans, the funds  available will be apportioned to the lenders based on the respective  current installments of principal and interest due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disposition of property. Funds obtained from the sale or  liquidation of secured property or fixed assets will be apportioned to  the lenders on the basis of the pro rata amount loaned, but not to  exceed their respective outstanding balances; provided, however, funds  obtained from such sale or liquidation for a project that included FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 grant funds will be  apportioned as may be required by the grant agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Protective advances. Protective advances are payments made by a  lender for items such as insurance or taxes, to protect the financial  interest of the lender, and charged to the borrower's loan account. To  the extent consistent with State law and customary lending practices in  the area, repayment of protective advances made by either lender, for  the mutual protection of both lenders, should receive first priority in  apportionment of funds between the lenders. To ensure agreement between  lenders, efforts should be made to obtain the concurrence of both  lenders before one lender makes a protective advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public bodies. Loans to such borrowers will be evidenced by  notes, bonds, warrants, or other contractual obligations as may be  authorized by relevant State statutes and by borrower's documents,  resolutions, and ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Utility-type facilities such as water and sewer systems, natural  gas distribution systems, electric systems, etc., will be secured by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The full faith and credit of the borrower when the debt is  evidenced by general obligation bonds; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pledges of taxes or assessments; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pledges of facility revenue and, when it is the customary  financial practice in the State, liens will be taken on the interest of  the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water  purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts,  and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used or to be  used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan  is approved or acquired with loan funds; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In those cases involving water and waste disposal projects where  there is a substantial number of other than full-time users and facility  costs result in a higher than reasonable rate for such full-time users,  the loan will be secured by the full faith and credit of the borrower or  by an assignment or pledge of taxes or assessments from public bodies or  other organizations having the authority to issue bonds or pledge such  taxes or assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solid waste systems. The type of security required will be  based on State law and what is determined adequate to protect the  interest of the United States during the repayment period of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other essential community facilities other than utility type,  such as those for public health and safety, social, and cultural needs  and the like will meet the following security requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such loans will be secured by one or a combination of the  following and in the following order of preference:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General obligation bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bonds which pledge other taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bonds pledging revenues of the facility being financed when such  bonds provide for the mandatory levy and collection of taxes in the  event revenues later become insufficient to properly operate and  maintain the facility and to retire the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assignment of assured income which will be available for the  life of the loan, from such sources as insurance premium rebates, income  from endowments, irrevocable trusts, or commitments from industries,  public bodies, or other reliable sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and  an assignment of the borrowers income from applicants who have been in  existence and are able to present evidence of a financially successful  operation of a similar facility for a period of time sufficient to  indicate project success. National Office concurrence is required when  the applicant has been in existence for less than five years or has not  operated on a financially successful basis for five years immediately  prior to loan application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and  an assignment of income from an organization receiving Health and Human  Services (HHS) operating grants under the ``Memorandum of Understanding  Between Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services and Farmers Home Administration or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354, U.S. Department of  Agriculture'' (see FmHA Instruction 2000-T, available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and  an assignment of income from an organization proposing a facility whose  users receive reliable income from programs such as social security,  supplemental security income (SSI), retirement plans, long-term  insurance annuities, medicare or medicaid. Examples are homes for the  handicapped or institutions whose clientele receive State or local  government assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> When the applicant cannot meet the criteria in paragraph  (g)(2)(iii)(A) (1) through (8) of this section, such proposals may be  considered when all the following are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant is a new organization or one that has not operated  the type of facility being proposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a demonstration of exceptional community support such  as substantial financial contributions, and aggressive leadership in the  formation of the organization and proposed project which indicates a  commitment of the entire community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State Director has determined that adequate and dependable  revenues will be available to meet all operation expenses, debt  repayment, and the required reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Prior National Office review and concurrence is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Real estate and chattel property taken as security in accordance  with paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A) (6) through (9) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ordinarily will include the property that is used in connection  with the facility being financed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Will have an as-developed present market value determined by a  qualified appraiser equal to or exceeding the amount of the loan to be  obtained plus any other indebtedness against the proposed security; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> May have one of the lien requirements deleted when the loan  approval official determines that the loan will be adequately secured  with a lien on either the real estate or chattel property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When security is not available in accordance with paragraphs  (g)(2)(iii)(A) (1) through (5) of this section and State law precludes  securing the loan with liens on real or chattel property, the loan will  be secured in the best manner consistent with State law and customary  security taken by private lenders in the State, such as revenue bonds,  and any other security the loan approval official determines necessary  for a sound loan. Such loans will otherwise meet the requirements of  (g)(2)(iii)(A) (6) through (9) of this section as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other-than-public bodies. Loans to other-than-public body  applicants will be secured as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Utility-type facilities eligible for FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance under paragraph (d) of this  section such as water and sewer systems, natural gas distribution  systems, electric systems, etc., will be secured as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assignments of borrower income will be taken and perfected by  filing, if legally permissable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A lien will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all  land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts,  water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts and similar property  rights, including leasehold interest, used, or to be used in connection  with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or  acquired with loan funds. In unusual circumstances where it is not  feasible to obtain a lien on such land (such as land rights obtained  from Federal or local government agencies, and from railroads) and the  loan approval official determines that the interest of FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 otherwise is secured  adequately, the lien requirement may be omitted as to such land rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When the loan is approved or the acquisition of real property is  subject to an outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority  lien obtainable will be taken if the loan approval official determines  that the loan is adequately secured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other security. Promissory notes from individuals, stock or  membership subscription agreements, individuals member's liability  agreements, or other evidences of debt, as well as mortgages or other  security instruments encumbering the private property of members of the  association may be pledged or assigned to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 as additional security in any case in which the  interest of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  not be otherwise adequately protected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In those cases where there is a substantial number of other than  full-time users and facility costs result in a higher than reasonable  rate for such full-time users, the loan will be secured by an assignment  or pledge of general obligation bonds, taxes, or assessments from public  bodies or other organizations having the authority to issue bonds or  pledge such taxes, or assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solid waste systems.

All projects financed under  the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments,  revenues, fees, or other satisfactory sources of revenues in an amount  sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, a  reasonable reserve, and debt payment. An overall review of the  applicant's financial status, including a review of all assets and  liabilities, will be a part of the docket review process by the FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 staff and approval  official. If the primary use of the facility is by business and the  success or failure of the facility is dependent on the business, then  the economic viability of that business must be assessed. The number of  users for a rural business will be based on equivalent dwelling units,  which is the level of service provided to a typical rural residential  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial feasibility reports. All applicants will be expected  to provide a financial feasibility report prepared by a qualified firm  or individual. These financial feasibility reports will normally be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Included as part of the preliminary engineer/architectural  report   using guides 6 through 10 as applicable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prepared by a qualified firm or individual not having a direct  interest in the management or construction of the facility using guide 5  when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The project will significantly affect the applicant's financial  operations and is not a utility-type facility but is dependent on  revenues from the facility to repay the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is specifically requested by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicants for loans for utility-type facilities dependent on  users fees for debt payment shall base their income and expense forecast  on realistic user estimates in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In estimating the number of users and establishing rates or fees  on which the loan will be based for new systems and for extensions or  improvements to existing systems, consideration should be given to the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An estimated number of maximum initial users should not be used  when setting user fees and rates since it may be several years before  all residents in the community will need the services provided by the  system. In establishing rates a realistic number of initial users should  be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> User agreements from individual vacant property owners will not  be considered when determining project feasibility unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner has plans to develop the property in a reasonable  period of time and become a user of the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner agrees in writing to make a monthly payment at least  equal to the proportionate share of debt service attributable to the  vacant property until the property is developed and the facility is  utilized on a regular basis. A bond or escrowed security deposit must be  provided to guarantee this monthly payment and to guarantee an amount at  least equal to the owner's proportionate share of construction costs. If  a bond is provided, it must be executed by a surety company that appears  on the Treasury Department's most current list (Circular 570, as  amended) and be authorized to transact business in the State where the  project is located. The guarantee shall be payable jointly to the  borrower and the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such guarantee will mature not later than 4 years from the date  of execution and will be finally due and payable upon default of a  monthly payment or at maturity, unless the property covered by the  guarantee has been developed and the facility is being utilized on a  regular basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Income from other vacant property owners will be considered only  as extra income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Realistic user estimates will be established as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Meaningful potential user cash contributions. Potential user  cash contributions are required except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For users presently receiving service, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  determines that the potential users as a whole in the applicant's  service area cannot make cash contributions, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use  of the system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority  agrees in writing to enforce such statutes, or ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of cash contributions required in paragraph  (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section will be set by the applicant and concurred  in by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.  Contribtions should be an amount high enough to indicate sincere  interest on the part of the potential user, but not so high as to  preclude service to low income families. Contributions ordinarily should  be an amount approximating one year's minimum user fee, and shall be  paid in full before loan closing or commencement of construction,  whichever occurs first. Once economic feasibility is ascertained based  on a demonstration of meaningful potential user cash contributions, the  contribution, membership fee or other fees that may be imposed are not a  requirement of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  under this section. However, borrowers do have an additional  responsibility relating to generating sufficient revenues as   set forth in paragraph (n)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Enforceable user agreement. Except for users presently receiving  service, an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause is required  unless State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the  system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority agrees in  writing to enforce such statutes or ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In those cases where all or part of the borrower's debt  payment revenues will come from user fees, applicants must provide a  positive program to encourage connection by all users as soon as service  is available. The program will be available for review and approval by  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 before loan  closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Such a  program shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An aggressive information program to be carried out during the  construction period. The borrower should send written notification to  all signed users at least three weeks in advance of the date service  will be available, stating the date users will be expected to have their  connections completed, and the date user charges will begin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Positive steps to assure that installation services will be  available. These may be provided by the contractor installing the  system, local plumbing companies, or local contractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Aggressive action to see that all signed users can finance their  connections. This might require collection of sufficient user  contributions to finance connections. Extreme cases might necessitate  additional loan funds for this purpose; however, loan funds should be  used only when absolutely necessary and when approved by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prior to loan closing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Utility-type facilities for new developing communities or areas.  Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in  new or developing areas and such facilities shall be installed in  compliance with appropriate State statutes and regulations. FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing will be considered  to an eligible applicant in such cases when failure to complete  development would result in an adverse economic condition for the rural  area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to  the success of an area development plan; and loan repayment can be  assured by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to  repay the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a  guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in  question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied  and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet  operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements. Such  guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in paragraph  (h)(2)(i)(B) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any  increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the  increased costs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The full faith and credit of a public body where the debt is  evidenced by general obligation bonds; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax  assessments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The user charges can become a tax lien upon the property being  served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to  be used for its intended purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reserve requirements. Provision for the accumulation of  necessary reserves over a reasonable period of time will be included in  the loan documents and in assessments, tax levies, or rates charged for  services. In those cases where statutes providing for extinguishing  assessment liens of public bodies when properties subject to such liens  are sold for delinquent State or local taxes, special reserves will be  established and maintained for the protection of the borrower's  assessment lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General obligation or special assessment bonds. Ordinarily, the  requirements for reserves will be considered to have been met if general  obligation or other bonds which pledge the full faith and credit of the  political subdivision are used, or special assessment bonds   are used, and if such bonds provide for the annual collection of  sufficient taxes or assessments to cover debt service, operation and  maintenance, and a reasonable amount for emergencies and to offset the  possible nonpayment of taxes or assessments by a percentage of the  property owners, or a statutory method is provided to prevent the  incurrence of a deficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other than general obligation or special assessment bonds. Each  borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves sufficient  to assure that loan installments will be paid on time, for emergency  maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for replacement of short- lived assets which have a useful life significantly less than the  repayment period of the loan. It is expected that borrowers issuing  bonds or other evidences of debt pledging facility revenues as security  will ordinarily plan their reserve to provide for a total reserve in an  amount at least equal to one average loan installment. It is also  expected the ordinarily such reserve will be accumulated at the rate of  at least one-tenth of the total each year until the desired level is  reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> General requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Membership authorization. For  organizations other than public bodies, the membership will authorize  the project and its financing except that the State Director may, with  the concurrence of OGC, accept the loan resolution without such  membership authorization when State statutes and the organization's  charter and bylaws do not require such authorization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The organization is well established and is operating with a  sound financial base; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For utility-type projects the members of the organization have  all signed an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause and have  made the required meaningful user cash contribution, except for members  presently receiving service or when State statutes or local ordinances  require mandatory use of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planning, bidding, contracting, constructing. (See  Sec. 1942.18).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insurance and fidelity bonds. The purpose of FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's insurance and fidelity bond  requirements is to protect the government's financial interest based on  the facility financed. The requirements below apply to all types of  coverage determined necessary. The National Office may grant exceptions  to normal requirements when appropriate justification is provided  establishing that it is in the best interest of the applicant/borrower  and will not adversely affect the government's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Applicants must provide evidence of adequate  insurance and fidelity bond coverage by loan closing or start of  construction, whichever occurs first. Adequate coverage in accordance  with this section must then be maintained for the life of the loan. It  is the responsibility of the applicant/borrower and not that of FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to assure that adequate  insurance and fidelity bond coverage is maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Insurance and fidelity bond requirements by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall normally not exceed  those proposed by the applicant/borrower if the FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 loan approval or servicing official  determines that proposed coverage is adequate to protect the  government's financial interest. Applicants/borrowers are encouraged to  have their attorney, consulting engineer/architect, and/or insurance  provider(s) review proposed types and amounts of coverage, including any  deductible provisions. If the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 official and the applicant/borrower cannot agree on the  acceptability of coverage proposed, a decision will be made by the State  Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The use of deductibles, i.e., an initial amount of each claim to  be paid by the applicant/borrower, may be allowed by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 providing the applicant/ borrower has financial resources which would likely be adequate to cover  potential claims requiring payment of the deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Borrowers must provide evidence to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 that adequate insurance and fidelity bond  coverage is being maintained. This may consist of   a listing of policies and coverage amounts in yearend reports submitted  with management reports required under Sec. 1942.17(q)(2) or other  documentation. The borrower is responsible for updating and/or renewing  policies or coverage which expire between submissions to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Any monitoring of insurance  and fidelity bond coverage by FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 is solely for the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354, and does not relieve the applicant/borrower of  its obligation under the loan resolution to maintain such coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fidelity bond. Applicants/borrowers will provide fidelity bond  coverage for all persons who have access to funds. Coverage may be  provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through  ``blanket'' coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees  and/or officials. An exception may be granted by the State Director when  funds relating to the facility financed are handled by another entity  and it is determined that the entity has adequate coverage or the  government's interest would otherwise be adequately protected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of coverage required by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 will normally approximate the total annual debt  service requirements for the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440- 24, ``Position Fidelity Schedule Bond'' may be used. Similar forms may  be used if determined acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354. Other types of coverage may be considered acceptable  if it is determined by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 that they fulfill essentially the same purpose as a fidelity  bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Fidelity bonds must be obtained from companies holding  certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31  CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies doing Business with the United  States.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Insurance. The following types of coverage must be maintained  if appropriate for the type of project and entity involved. Insurance  must be in amounts acceptable to the Agency and at least equivalent to  coverage for real property and equipment acquired without Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acquisition of land, easements, water rights, and existing  facilities. Applicants are responsible for acquisition of all property  rights necessary for the project and will determine that prices paid are  reasonable and fair. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 may require an appraisal by an independent appraiser or FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Title for land, rights-of-way, easements, or existing  facilities. The applicant must certify and provide a legal opinion  relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442-21, ``Rights-of-Way  Certificate,'' and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 442-22, ``Opinion of Counsel Relative to Rights-of-Way,'' may be  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rights-of-way and easements. Applicants are responsible for and  will obtain valid, continuous and adequate rights-of-way and easements  needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442-20,  ``Right-of-Way Easement,'' may be used. When a site is for major  structures for utility-type facilities such as a reservoir or pumping  station and the applicant is able to obtain only a right-of-way or  easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, the applicant  will furnish a title report thereon by the applicant's attorney showing  ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects,  restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the  applicant to obtain and record such releases, consents or subordinations  to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other  instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and  maintenance of the facility and give FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 the required security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Title for land or existing facilities. Title to land essential  to the successful operation of facilities or title to facilities being  purchased, must not contain any restrictions that will adversely affect  the suitability, successful operation, security value, or  transferability of the facility. Title opinions must be provided by the  applicant's attorney. The opinions must be in sufficient detail to  assess marketability of the property. Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 1927-9, ``Preliminary Title Opinion,'' and Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1927-10, ``Final  Title Opinion,'' may be used to provide the required title opinions. If  other forms are used they must be reviewed and approved by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and OGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of receiving title opinions from the applicant's  attorney, the applicant may use a title insurance company. If a title  insurance company is used, the company must provide FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a title insurance binder,  disclosing all title defects or restrictions, and include a commitment  to issue a title insurance policy. The policy should be in an amount at  least equal to the market value of the property as improved. The title  insurance binder and commitment should be provided to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prior to requesting closing  instructions. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  be provided a title insurance policy which will insure FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's interest in the property  without any title defects or restrictions which have not been waived by  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The loan approval official may waive title defects or  restrictions, such as utility easements, that do not adversely affect  the suitability, successful operation, security value, or  transferability of the facility. If the District Director is the loan  approval official and is unable to waive the defect or restriction, the  title opinion or title insurance binder will be forwarded to the State  Director. If the State Director, with the advice of the OGC, determines  that the defect or restriction cannot be waived, the defect or  restriction must be removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Water rights. When legally permissible, an assignment will be  taken on water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant. The  following will be furnished as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement by the applicant's attorney regarding the nature of  the water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant (such as  conveyance of title, appropriation and decree, application and permit,  public notice and appropriation and use).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A copy of a contract with another company or municipality to  supply water; or stock certificates in another company which represents  the right to receive water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Land purchase contract: (A) A land purchase contract (known in  some areas as a contract for deed) is an agreement between two or more  parties which obligates the purchaser to pay the purchase price, gives  the purchaser the rights of immediate possession, control, and  beneficial use of the property, and entitles the purchaser to a deed  upon paying all or a specified part of the purchase price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Applicants may obtain land through land purchase contracts when  all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The applicant has exhausted all reasonable means of obtaining  outright fee simple title to the necessary land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant cannot obtain the land through condemnation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There are not other suitable sites available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)(D)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The land purchase contract must provide for the transfer of  ownership by the seller without any restrictions, liens or other title  defects. The contract must not contain provisions for future advances  (except for taxes, insurance, or other costs needed to protect the  security), summary cancellations, summary forfeiture, or other clauses  that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the purchaser's ability  to pay the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan.  The contract must provide that if   the purchaser fails to make payment that FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 will be given at least 90 days written notice  with an option to cure the default before the contract can be cancelled,  terminated or foreclosed. Then FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 must have the option of making the payment and charging it  to the purchaser's account, making the payment and taking over the  ownership of the purchase contract, or taking any other action necessary  to protect the Government's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Prior to loan closing or the beginning of construction,  whichever occurs first, the following actions must be taken in the order  listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The land purchase contract and any appropriate title opinions  must be reviewed by the Regional Attorney to determine if they are  legally sufficient to protect the interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The land purchase contract, the Regional Attorney's comments,  and the State Director's recommendations must be submitted to the  National Office for concurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The land purchase contract must be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lease agreements. Where the right of use or control of real  property not owned by the applicant/borrower is essential to the  successful operation of the facility during the life of the loan, such  right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the  owner(s) of the property and the applicant/borrower. Lease agreements  shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site of facility,  forfeiture or summary cancellation clauses and shall provide for the  right to transfer and lease without restriction. Lease agreements will  ordinarily be written for a term at least equal to the term of the loan.  Such lease contracts or agreements will be approved by the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan approval official with  the advice and counsel of the Regional Attorney, OGC, as to the legal  sufficiency of such documents. A copy of the lease contract or agreement  will be included in the loan docket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notes and bonds. Notes and bonds will be completed on the date  of loan closing except for the entry of subsequent multiple advances  where applicable. The amount of each note will be in multiples of not  less than $100. The amount of each bond will ordinarily be in multiples  of not less than $1,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440- 22, ``Promissory Note (Association or Organization),'' will ordinarily  be used for loans to nonpublic bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1942.19 contains instructions for preparation of notes  and bonds evidencing indebtedness of public bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Environmental requirements. Environmental requirements will be  documented by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in  accordance with subpart G part 1940 of this chapter. The applicant will  provide any information required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Health care facilities. The applicant will be responsible for  obtaining the following documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement from the responsible State agency certifying that  the proposed health care facility is not inconsistent with the State  Medical Facilities Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement from the responsible State agency or regional  office of the Department of Health and Services certifying that the  proposed facility meets the standards in Sec. 1942.18(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Public information. Applicants should inform the general public  regarding the development of any proposed project. Any applicant not  required to obtain authorization by vote of its membership or by public  referendum, to incur the obligations of the proposed loan or grant, will  hold at least one public information meeting. The public meeting must be  held after the preapplication is filed and not later than loan approval.  The meeting must give the citizenry an opportunity to become acquainted  with the proposed project and to comment on such items as economic and  environmental impacts, service area, alternatives to the project, or any  other issue identified by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354. The applicant will be required, at least 10 days prior to the  meeting, to publish a notice of the meeting in a newspaper of general  circulation in the service area, to post a   public notice at the applicant's principal office, and to notify FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The applicant will  provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 a copy of  the published notice and minutes of the public meeting. A public meeting  is not normally required for subsequent loans which are needed to  complete the financing of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Service through individual installation. Community owned water  or waste disposal systems may provide service through individual  installations or small clusters of users within the applicant's service  area. When individual installations or small clusters are proposed, the  loan approval official should consider items such as: quantity and  quality of the individual installations that may be developed; cost  effectiveness of the individual facility compared with the initial and  long term user cost on a central system; health and pollution problems  attributable to individual facilities; operational or management  problems peculiar to individual installations; and permit and regulatory  agency requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicants providing service through individual facilities must  meet the eligibility requirements in Sec. 1942.17(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must  approve the form of agreement between the owner and individual users for  the installation, operation and payment for individual facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If taxes or assessments are not pledged as security, owners  providing service through individual facilities must obtain security as  necessary to assure collection of any sum the individual user is  obligated to pay the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notes representing indebtedness owed the owner by a user for an  individual facility will be scheduled for payment over a period not to  exceed the useful life of the individual facility or the loan, whichever  is shorter. The interest rate will not exceed the interest rate charged  the owner on the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Owners providing service through individual or cluster  facilities must obtain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Easements for the installation and ingress to and egress from  the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An adequate method for denying service in the event of  nonpayment of user fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Funds from other sources. FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 loan funds may be used along with or in connection  with funds provided by the applicant or from other sources. Since  ``matching funds'' is not a requirement for FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 loans, shared revenues may be used with FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds for project  construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Other Federal, State, and local requirements. Each application  shall contain the comments, necessary certifications and recommendations  of appropriate regulatory or other agency or institution having  expertise in the planning, operation, and management of similar  facilities. Proposals for facilities financed in whole or in part with  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds will be  coordinated with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies in  accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with special laws and regulations. Except as provided  in paragraph (k)(2) of this section applicants will be required to  comply with Federal, State, and local laws and any regulatory commission  rules and regulations pertaining to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Organization of the applicant and its authority to construct,  operate, and maintain the proposed facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Borrowing money, giving security therefore, and raising  revenues for the repayment thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Land use zoning; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Health and sanitation standards and design and installation  standards unless an exception is granted by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance exceptions. If there are conflicts between this  subpart and state or local laws or regulatory commission regulations,  the provisions of this subpart will control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State Pollution Control or Environmental Protection Agency  Standards. Water and waste disposal facilities will be designed,  installed, and operated in such a manner that they will not result in  the pollution of water in the State in excess of established standards  and that any effluent will conform with appropriate State and Federal  Water Pollution Control Standards. A certification from the appropriate  State and Federal agencies for water pollution control standards will be  obtained showing that established standards are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Consistency with other development plans. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 financed facilities will not be  inconsistent with any development plans of State, multijurisdictional  areas, counties, or municipalities in which the proposed project is  located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> State agency regulating water rights. Each FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 financed facility will be in compliance  with appropriate State agency regulations which have control of the  appropriation, diversion, storage and use of water and disposal of  excess water. All of the rights of any landowners, appropriators, or  users of water from any source will be fully honored in all respects as  they may be affected by facilities to be installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Civil Rights Act of 1964. All borrowers are subject to, and  facilities must be operated in accordance with, title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 and subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter,  particularly as it relates to conducting and reporting of compliance  reviews. Instruments of conveyance for loans and/or grants subject to  the Act must contain the covenant required by Sec. 1901.202(e) of  subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. No person in the  United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation  in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under  any education program or education activity receiving FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financial assistance except as  otherwise provided for in the Education Amendments of title IX. The FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director will  provide guidance and technical assistance to carry out the intent of  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Under section 504  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), no  handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of  their handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the  benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or  activity receiving FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  financial assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Age Discrimination Act of 1975. This Act provides that no person  in the United States shall on the basis of age, be excluded from  participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to  discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial  assistance. This Act also applies to programs or activities funded under  the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (31 U.S.C. 1221 et.  seq.). This Act does not apply to: (i) age distinctions contained in  Federal, State or local statutes or ordinances adopted by an elected,  general purpose legislative body which provide benefits or assistance  based on age; (ii) establish criteria for participation in age-related  terms; (iii) describe intended beneficiaries or target groups in age- related terms; and, (iv) any employment practice of any employer,  employment agency, labor organization, or any labor-management joint  apprenticeship training program except for any program or activity  receiving Federal financial assistance for public service employment  under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1974 (CETA) (29  U.S.C. 801 et. seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Professional services and contracts related to the facility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Professional services. Applicants will be responsible for providing the  services necessary to plan projects including design of facilities,  preparation of cost and income estimates, development of proposals for  organization and financing, and overall   operation and maintenance of the facility. Professional services of the  following may be necessary: Engineer, architect, attorney, bond counsel,  accountant, auditor, appraiser, and financial advisory or fiscal agent  (if desired by applicant). Contracts or other forms of agreement between  the applicant and its professional and technical representatives are  required and are subject to FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 concurrence. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 1942-19, ``Agreement for Engineering Services,'' may be used  when appropriate. Guide 20, ``Agreement for Engineering Services (FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354/EPA--Jointly Funded  Projects)'' may be used on projects jointly funded by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and EPA. Guide 14 may be used  in the preparation of the legal services agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bond counsel. Unless otherwise provided by Sec. 1942.19(b),  public bodies are required to obtain the service of recognized bond  counsel in the preparation of evidence of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contracts for other services. Contracts or other forms of  agreements for other services including management, operation, and  maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for review and approval.  Management agreements should provide at least those items in guide 24.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees. Fees provided for in contracts or agreements shall be  reasonable. They shall be considered to be reasonable if not in excess  of those ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work when FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing is not  involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Applying for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 loans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preapplication. Applicants desiring loans will file SF  424.2 and comments from the appropriate A-95 clearinghouse agency  normally with the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 County Office. The County Supervisor will immediately  forward all documents to the District Office. The District Director has  prime responsibility for all community program loan making and servicing  activities within the District.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preapplication review. Upon receipt of the preapplication, FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will tentatively  determine eligibility including the likelihood of credit elsewhere at  reasonable rates and terms and availability of FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 loan funds. The determination as to  availability of other credit will be made after considering present  rates and terms available for similar proposals (not necessarily based  upon rates and terms available from FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354); the repayment potential of the applicant; long-term  cost to the applicant; and average user or other charges. In those cases  where FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines  that loans at reasonable rates and terms should be available from  commercial sources, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 will notify the applicant so that it may apply for such financial  assistance. Such applicants may be reconsidered for FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loans upon their presenting  satisfactory evidence of inability to obtain commercial financing at  reasonable rates and terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incurring obligations. Applicants should not proceed with  planning nor obligate themselves for expenditures until authorized by  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Results of preapplication review. After FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 has reviewed the preapplication material  and any additional material that may be requested, Form AD-622 will be  sent to the applicant. Ordinarily the review will not exceed 45 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application conference. Before starting to assemble the  application and after the applicant selects its professional and  technical representatives, it should arrange with FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 for an application conference to provide  a basis for orderly application   assembly. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  provide applicants with a list of documents necessary to complete the  application. Guide 15 may be used for this purpose. Applications will be  filed with the District Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application completion and assembling. This is the  responsibility of the applicant with guidance from FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354. The applicant may utilize their  professional and technical representatives or other competent sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Review of decision. If an application is rejected, the applicant  may request a review of this decision under subpart B of part 1900 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Actions prior to loan closing and start of construction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Excess FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan and  grant funds. If there is a significant reduction in project cost, the  applicant's funding needs will be reassessed before loan closing or the  start of construction, whichever occurs first. In such cases applicable  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 forms, the letter  of conditions, and other items will be revised. Decreases in FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds will be based on revised  project costs and current number of users, however, other factors  including FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  regulations used at the time of loan/grant approval will remain the  same. Obligated loan or grant funds not needed to complete the proposed  project will be deobligated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Loan resolutions. Loan resolutions will be adopted by both  public and other-than-public bodies using Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1942-47, ``Loan Resolution (Public  Bodies),'' or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1942-9, ``Loan Resolution (Security Agreement).'' These resolutions  supplement other provisions in this subpart. The applicant will agree:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To indemnify the Government for any payments made or losses  suffered by the Government on behalf of the association. Such  indemnification shall be payable from the same source of funds pledged  to pay the bonds or any other legally permissible source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To comply with applicable local, State and Federal laws,  regulations, and ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To provide for the receipt of adequate revenues to meet the  requirements of debt service, operation and maintenance, establishment  of adequate reserves, and to continually operate and maintain the  facility in good condition. Except for utility-type facilities, free  service use may be permitted. If free services are extended no  distinctions will be made in the extension of those services because of  race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, or physical  or mental handicap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To acquire and maintain such insurance coverage including  fidelity bonds, as may be required by the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> To establish and maintain such books and records relating to the  operation of the facility and its financial affairs and to provide for  required audit thereof in such a manner as may be required by the  Government and to provide the Government without its request, a copy of  each such audit and to make and forward to the Government such  additional information and reports as it may, from time to time,  require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> To provide the Government at all reasonable times, access to  all books and records relating to the facility and access to the  property of the system so that the Government may ascertain that the  association is complying with the provisions hereof and of the  instruments incident to the making or insuring of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> To provide adequate service to all persons within the service  area who can feasibly and legally be served and to obtain FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's concurrence prior to  refusing new or adequate services to such persons. Upon failure of the  applicant to provide services which are feasible and legal, such person  shall have a direct right of action against the applicant organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> To have prepared on its behalf and to adopt an ordinance or  resolution for the issuance of its bonds or notes or other debt  instruments or other such   items and in such forms as are required by State statutes and as are  agreeable and acceptable to the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> To refinance the unpaid balance, in whole or in part, of its  debt upon the request of the Government if at any time it should appear  to the Government that the association is able to refinance its bonds by  obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or  private sources at reasonable rates and terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> To provide for, execute, and comply with Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 400-4, ``Assurance  Agreement,'' and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 400-1, ``Equal Opportunity Agreement,'' including an ``Equal  Opportunity Clause,'' which is to be incorporated in or attached as a  rider to each construction contract and subcontract in excess of  $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To place the proceeds of the loan on deposit in a manner  approved by the Government. Funds must be deposited and maintained in  insured accounts whenever possible. Funds must be maintained in interest  bearing accounts, unless the following apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The borrower receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per  year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not  be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash  balances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The depository would require an average or minimum balance so  high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non- Federal cash resources; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes  interest bearing accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interest earned on Federal payments deposited in interest- bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health  and Human Services, Payment Management System, Rockville, MD 20852.  Interest amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal  entity for administrative expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Not to sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise encumber the  facility or any portion thereof or interest therein, and not to permit  others to do so, without the prior written consent of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Not to borrow any money from any source, enter into any  contract or agreement, or incur any other liabilities in connection with  making enlargements, improvements or extensions to, or for any other  purpose in connection with the facility (exclusive of normal  maintenance) without the prior written consent of the Government if such  undertaking would involve the source of funds pledged to repay the debt  to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> That upon default in the payments of any principal and accrued  interest on the bonds or in the performance of any covenant or agreement  contained herein or in the instruments incident to making or insuring  the loan, the Government, at its option, may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Declare the entire principal amount then outstanding and accrued  interest, due and payable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the account of the association (payable from the source of  funds pledged to pay the bonds or notes or any other legally  permissiable source), incur and pay reasonable expenses for repair,  maintenance and operation of the facility and such other reasonable  expenses as may be necessary to cure the cause of default; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Take possession of the facility, repair, maintain and operate,  or otherwise dispose of the facility. Default under the provisions of  the resolution or any instrument incident to the making or insuring of  the loan may be construed by the Government to constitute default under  any other instrument held by the Government and executed or assumed by  the association and default under any such instrument may be construed  by the Government to constitute default hereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interim financing. In all loans exceeding $50,000, where funds  can be borrowed at reasonable interest rates on an interim basis from  commercial sources for the construction period, such interim financing  will be obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances  of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds. Guide 1  or guide 1a, as appropriate, may be used to inform the private lender of  FmHA or its successor   agency under Public Law 103-354's commitment. When interim commercial  financing is used, the application will be processed, including  obtaining construction bids, to the stage where the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan would normally be closed,  that is immediately prior to the start of construction. The FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan should be closed as soon  as possible after the disbursal of all interim funds. Interim financing  may be for a fixed term provided the fixed term does not extend beyond  the time projected for completion of construction. For this purpose, a  fixed term is when the interim lender cannot be repaid prior to the end  of the stipulated term of the interim instruments. When an FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Water and Waste Disposal grant  is included, any interim financing involving a fixed term must be for  the total FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan  amount. Multiple advances may be used in conjunction with interim  commercial financing when the applicant is unable to obtain sufficient  funds through interim commercial financing in an amount equal to the  loan. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan  proceeds (including advances) will be used to retire the interim  commercial indebtedness. Before the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 loan is closed, the applicant will be required to  provide FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with  statements from the contractor, engineer, architect, and attorney that  they have been paid to date in accordance with their contracts or other  agreements and, in the case of the contractor, that any suppliers and  subcontractors have been paid. If such statements cannot be obtained,  the loan may be closed provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statements to the extent possible are obtained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 can be adequately protected and its security position is not  impaired; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid accounts  by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay such claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Obtaining closing instructions. After loan approval, the  completed docket will be reviewed by the State Director. The information  required by OGC will be transmitted to OGC with request for closing  instructions. Upon receipt of the closing instructions from OGC, the  State Director will forward them along with any appropriate instructions  to the District Director. Upon receipt of closing instructions, the  District Director will discuss with the applicant and its architect or  engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the  requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with  closing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Applicant contribution. An applicant contributing funds toward  the project cost shall deposit these funds in its construction account  on or before loan closing or start of construction, whichever occurs  first. Project costs paid prior to the required deposit time with  applicant funds shall be appropriately accounted for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Evidence of and disbursement of other funds. Applicants  expecting funds from other sources for use in completing projects being  partially financed with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 funds will present evidence of the commitment of these funds  from such other sources. This evidence will be available before loan  closing, or the start of construction, whichever occurs first.  Ordinarily, the funds provided by the applicant or from other sources  will be disbursed prior to the use of FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 loan funds. If this is not possible, funds will be  disbursed on a pro rata basis. FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 funds will not be used to pre-finance funds committed to the  project from other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Loan closing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Closing instructions. Loans will be closed in  accordance with the closing instructions issued by OGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Obtaining insurance and fidelity bonds. Required property  insurance policies, liability insurance policies, and fidelity bonds  will be obtained by the time of loan closing or start of construction,  whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distribution of recorded documents. The originals of the  recorded deeds, easements, permits, certificates of water rights,  leases, or other contracts and similar documents which are not to be  held by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be  returned to the borrower. The original mortgage(s) and water stock  certificates, if any, if not required by the recorder's office will be  retained by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Review of loan closing. In order to determine that the loan has  been properly closed the loan docket will be reviewed by the State  Director and OGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Project monitoring and fund delivery during construction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Coordination of funding sources. When a project is jointly financed, the  State Director will reach any needed agreement or understanding with the  representatives of the other source of funds on distribution of  responsibilities for handling various aspects of the project. These  responsibilities will include supervision of construction, inspections  and determinations of compliance with appropriate regulations concerning  equal employment opportunities, wage rates, nondiscrimination in making  services or benefits available, and environmental compliance. If any  problems develop which cannot be resolved locally, complete information  should be sent to the National Office for advice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiple advances. In the event interim commercial financing is  not legally permissible or not available, multiple advances of FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan funds are required.  An exception to this requirement may be granted by the National Office  when a single advance is necessitated by State law or public exigency.  Multiple advances will be used only for loans in excess of $50,000.  Advances will be made only as needed to cover disbursements required by  the borrower over a 30-day period. Advances should not exceed 24 in  number nor extend longer than two years beyond loan closing. Normally,  the retained percentage withheld from the contractor to assure  construction completion will be included in the last advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 1942.19 contains instructions for making multiple  advances to public bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Advances will be requested by the borrower in writing. The  request should be in sufficient amounts to pay cost of construction,  rights-of-way and land, legal, engineering, interest, and other expenses  as needed. The applicant may use Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 440-11, ``Estimate of Funds Needed for 30 Day Period  Commencing ------,'' to show the amount of funds needed during the 30- day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan  funds obligated for a specific purpose, such as the paying of interest,  but not needed at the time of loan closing will remain in the Finance  Office until needed unless State statutes require all funds to be  delivered to the borrower at the time of closing. Loan funds may be  advanced to prepay costs under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(G) of this section.  If all funds must be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing to  comply with State statutes, funds not needed at loan closing will be  handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Deposited in an appropriate borrower account, such as the debt  service account, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deposited in a supervised bank account under paragraph (p)(3)(i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use and accountability of funds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Supervised bank account.  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan funds and any  funds furnished by the applicant/borrower to supplement the loan  including contributions to purchase major items of equipment, machinery,  and furnishings may be deposited in a supervised bank account if  determined necessary as provided in subpart A of part 1902 of this  chapter. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has  a Memorandum of Understanding with another agency that provides for the  use of supervised bank accounts, or when FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 is the primary source of funds for a project  and has determined that the use of a supervised bank account is  necessary, project funds from other sources may also be deposited in   the supervised bank account. FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 shall not be accountable to the source of the other funds  nor shall FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  undertake responsibility to administer the funding program of the other  entity. Supervised bank accounts should not be used for funds advanced  by an interim lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other than supervised bank account. If a supervised bank  account is not used, arrangements will be agreed upon for the prior  concurrence by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of  the bills or vouchers upon which warrants will be drawn, so that the  payments from loan funds can be controlled and FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 records kept current. If a supervised  bank account is not used, use Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 402-2, ``Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,'' or  similar form to monitor funds. Periodic reviews of nonsupervised  accounts shall be made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 at the times and in the manner as FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 prescribes in the conditions of loan approval.  State laws regulating the depositories to be used shall be complied  with.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of minority owned banks. Applicants are encouraged to use  minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority  group members) for the deposit and disbursement of funds. A list of  minority owned banks can be obtained from the Office of Minority  Business Enterprise, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 and is  also available in all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Development inspections. The District Director will be  responsible for monitoring the construction of all projects being  financed, wholly or in part, with FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 funds. Technical assistance will be provided by the  State Director's staff. Project monitoring will include construction  inspections and a review of each project inspection report, each change  order and each partial payment estimate and other invoices such as  payment for engineering/architectural and legal fees and other materials  determined necessary to effectively monitor each project. These  activities will not be performed on behalf of the applicant/borrower,  but are solely for the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 and in no way are intended to relieve the applicant/ borrower of corresponding obligations to conduct similar monitoring and  inspection activities. Project monitoring will include periodic  inspections to review partial payment estimates prior to their approval  and to review project development in accordance with plans and  specifications. Each inspection will be recorded using Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12, ``Inspection  Report.'' The original Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 1924-12 will be filed in the project case folder and a copy  furnished to the State Director. The State Director will review  inspection reports and will determine that the project is being  effectively monitored. The District Director is authorized to review and  accept partial payment estimates prepared by the contractor and approved  by the borrower, provided the consulting engineer or architect, if one  is being utilized for the project, has approved the estimate and  certified that all material purchased or work performed is in accordance  with the plans and specifications, or if a consulting engineer or  architect is not being utilized, the District Director has determined  that the funds requested are for authorized purposes. If there is any  indication that construction is not being completed in accordance with  the plans and specifications or that any other problems exist, the  District Director should notify the State Director immediately and  withhold all payments on the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Payment for construction. Each payment for project costs must be  approved by the borrower's governing body. Payment for construction must  be for amounts shown on payment estimate forms. Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-18, ``Partial Payment  Estimate,'' may be used for this purpose or other   similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the State Director  or designee. However, the State Director or designee cannot require a  greater reporting burden than is required by Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-18. Advances for contract retainage  will not be made until such retainage is due and payable under the terms  of the contract. The review and acceptance of project costs, including  construction partial payment estimates by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354, does not attest to the correctness of the  amounts, the quantities shown, or that the work has been performed under  the terms of agreements or contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use of remaining funds. Funds remaining after all costs incident  to the basic project have been paid or provided for will not include  applicant contributions. Applicant contributions will be considered as  funds initially expended for the project. Funds remaining, with  exception of applicant contributions, may be considered in direct  proportion to the amount obtained from each source. Remaining funds will  be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Agency loan and/or grant funds. Remaining funds may be used for  purposes authorized by paragraph (d) of this section, provided the use  will not result in major changes to the facility design or project and  that the purposes of the loan and/or grant remains the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On projects that only involve an FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 loan and no FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 grant, funds that are not needed will be applied as  an extra payment on the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 indebtedness unless other disposition is required by the bond  ordinance, resolution, or State statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On projects that involve an FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 grant, all remaining FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 funds will be considered to be grant funds up  to the full amount of the grant. Grant funds not expended under  paragraph (p)(6)(i) of this section will be deobligated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Funds from other sources. Funds remaining from other sources  will be handled according to rules, regulations and/or the agreement  governing their participation in the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Borrower accounting methods, management reporting and audits.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual financial statements. Borrowers are required to provide the  Agency with annual financial statements for the life of the loan as  outlined in the Letter of Conditions issued by the Agency. The financial  statements are the responsibility of the borrower's governing body. The  type of statement required is dependent on the amount of Federal  financial assistance received during the borrower's fiscal year. Federal  financial assistance includes Federal assistance that a non-Federal  entity received or administered during the entity's fiscal year in the  form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees. A Federal award is Federal  financial assistance a non-Federal entity received directly from Federal  awarding agencies or indirectly from pass-through entities. Federal  awards expended generally pertain to events that require the non-Federal  entity to comply with Federal Statues, regulations, and terms and  conditions of federal awards, such as: expenditure/expense transactions  associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative  agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed  through to sub-recipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan  guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus  property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or  consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling  the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when  insurance is in force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of accounting and preparation of financial statements.  Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on the  accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP), unless State statute, tribal law or  regulatory agencies provide otherwise, or an exception is granted by the  Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a basis  other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary adjustments so   that annual financial statements are presented on the accrual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Record retention. Each Applicant will retain all records, books,  and supporting material for 3 years after the issuance of the audit or  management reports, or for a time period required by other agencies or  common business practice, whichever is longer. Upon request, this  material will be made available to Rural Development, OIG, USDA, the  Comptroller General, or to their assignees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Audits. Any applicant that expends $750,000 or more in Federal  financial assistance during their fiscal year must submit an audit  report conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, ``Audit  Requirements.'' Applicants expending less than $750,000 in Federal  financial assistance per fiscal year are exempt from 2 CFR part 200  audit requirements. All audits are to be performed in accordance with  the latest revision of the Generally Accepted Government Accounting  Standards (GAGAS), developed by the Comptroller General of the United  States. Further guidance on preparing an acceptable audit can be  obtained from any Agency office. It is not intended that audits required  by this part be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance  with State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should  be done in conjunction with those audits. Audits should be supplied to  the Processing Official within the timeframes stated in paragraph (f) of  this section. OMB Circulars and Agency Compliance Supplements are  available in any USDA/Agency office or OMB's Web site. Any state, local  government, or Indian tribe that is required by constitution or state  statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less  frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits biennially,  pursuant to 2 CFR 200.504(a). This requirement must still be in effect  for the biennial period. Any nonprofit organization that had biennial  audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January  1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits biennially, pursuant to 2  CFR 200.504(b). All biennial audits must cover both years within the  biennial period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exemption from audits. Except as noted in 2 CFR 200.503,  Relation to other audit requirement, public bodies or nonprofits  expending less than $750,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year,  whose payments are current, and are having no signs of operational or  financial difficulty may submit a management report. A management  report, at a minimum, will include a balance sheet and income and  expense statement. Financial information may be reported on Form RD 442- 2, ``Statement of Budget, Income and Equity'' and RD Form 442-3,  ``Balance Sheet'', or similar. The following management data will be  submitted by the borrower to the servicing office. Records must be  available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal  agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual management reports. Thirty days prior to the beginning of  each fiscal year the following will be submitted to the Servicing  Official:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One copy of the proposed annual budget. The borrower will submit  two copies of Form RD 442-2, or equivalent, Statement of Budget, Income  and Equity, Schedule 1, page 1; and Schedule 2, Projected Cash Flow. The  only data required at this time is Schedule 1, page 1, Column 3, annual  budget, and all of Schedule 2, Projected Cash Flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An annual audit report may be submitted in lieu of Forms RD 442- 2 and 442-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Deadlines for submitting audits and management reports. In  accordance with 2 CFR part 200, audits must be submitted no later than 9  months after the end of the fiscal year or 30 days after the borrower's  receipt of the auditor's reports, whichever is earlier. Management  reports must be submitted no later than 2 months after the end of the  borrower's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Additional information to be submitted with audits and  management reports. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Insurance. Agency borrowers will maintain  adequate insurance coverage as required by the loan resolution and  Sec. 1942.17(j)(3). The servicing official is required to monitor  insurance annually after the initial insurance verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reserve account(s). Borrowers will provide documentation that  the Agency required reserve account(s) is properly funded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Property tax information. If applicable, documentation that  property taxes have been paid and are current.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A list of directors and officers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Quarterly reports. A quarterly management report will be  required for the first full year of operations for new borrowers, and  existing borrowers operating a new facility, starting a new type of  operation or proposing a significant expansion of an existing facility.  Borrowers should submit the following to the Servicing Official:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One copy of Form RD 442-2, or equivalent, Schedule 1, page 1,  columns 4-6, as appropriate, and page 2. This information should be  received in the Servicing Office 30 days after the end of each of the  first three quarters of the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Servicing Office may request a borrower experiencing  financial or management problems to submit quarterly copies of Form RD  442-2, or equivalent, Schedule 1, pages 1 and 2.
