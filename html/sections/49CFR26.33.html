                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you determine that DBE firms are so overconcentrated in a certain type of work as to unduly burden the opportunity of non-DBE firms to participate in this type of work, you must devise appropriate measures to address this overconcentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These measures may include the use of incentives, technical assistance, business development programs, mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] programs, and other appropriate measures designed to assist DBEs in performing work outside of the specific field in which you have determined that non-DBEs are unduly burdened. You may also consider varying your use of contract goals, to the extent consistent with Sec. 26.51, to unsure that non-DBEs are not unfairly prevented from competing for subcontracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must obtain the approval of the concerned DOT operating administration for your determination of overconcentration and the measures you devise to address it. Once approved, the measures become part of your DBE program.</p>
