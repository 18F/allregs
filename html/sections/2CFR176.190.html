Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of  the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section.  Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans  under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon  contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any  resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for  construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section  1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative  agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning  the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally  assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The  Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization  Plan Number 14.</p>
