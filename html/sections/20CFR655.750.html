                                Sec. 655.750  What is the validity period of the labor condition
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Validity of certified labor condition applications. A labor  condition application (LCA) certified under Sec. 655.740 is valid for  the period of employment indicated by the authorized DOL official on  Form ETA 9035E or ETA 9035. The validity period of an LCA will not begin  before the application is certified. If the approved LCA is the initial  LCA issued for the nonimmigrant, the period of authorized employment  must not exceed 3 years for an LCA issued on behalf of an H-1B or H-1B1  nonimmigrant and must not exceed 2 years for an LCA issued on behalf of  an   E-3 nonimmigrant. If the approved LCA is for an extension of an H-1B1 it  must not exceed two years. The period of authorized employment in the  aggregate is based on the first date of employment and ends:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an H-1B or initial H-1B1 LCA, on the latest date  indicated or three years after the employment start date under the LCA,  whichever comes first; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an E-3 or an H-1B1 extension LCA, on the latest  date indicated or two years after the employment start date under the  LCA, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal of certified labor condition applications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  employer who has filed a labor condition application which has been  certified pursuant to Sec. 655.740 of this part may withdraw such labor  condition application at any time before the expiration of the validity  period of the application, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrants are not employed at the place  of employment pursuant to the LCA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator has not commenced an investigation of the  particular application. Any such request for withdrawal shall be null  and void; and the employer shall remain bound by the labor condition  application until the enforcement proceeding is completed, at which time  the application may be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for withdrawals must be in writing and must be sent to  ETA, Office of Foreign Labor Certification. ETA will publish the mailing  address, and any future mailing address changes, in the Federal  Register, and will also post the address on the DOL Web site at http:// www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employer shall comply with the ``required wage rate'' and  ``prevailing working conditions'' statements of its labor condition  application required under Sec. Sec. 655.731 and 655.732 of this part,  respectively, even if such application is withdrawn, at any time H-1B  nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to the application, unless the  application is superseded by a subsequent application which is certified  by ETA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employer's obligation to comply with the ``no strike or  lockout'' and ``notice'' statements of its labor condition application  (required under Sec. Sec. 655.733 and 655.734 of this part,  respectively), shall remain in effect and the employer shall remain  subject to investigation and sanctions for misrepresentation on these  statements even if such application is withdrawn, regardless of whether  H-1B nonimmigrants are actually employed, unless the application is  superseded by a subsequent application which is certified by ETA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Only for the purpose of assuring the labor standards protections  afforded under the H-1B program, where an employer files a petition with  DHS under the H-1B classification pursuant to a certified LCA that had  been withdrawn by the employer, such petition filing binds the employer  to all obligations under the withdrawn LCA immediately upon receipt of  such petition by DHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Invalidation or suspension of a labor condition application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Invalidation of a labor condition application shall result from  enforcement action(s) by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division,  under subpart I of this part--e.g., a final determination finding the  employer's failure to meet the application's condition regarding strike  or lockout; or the employer's willful failure to meet the wage and  working conditions provisions of the application; or the employer's  substantial failure to meet the notice of specification requirements of  the application; see Sec. Sec. 655.734 and 655.760 of this part; or the  misrepresentation of a material fact in an application. Upon notice by  the Administrator of the employer's disqualification, ETA shall  invalidate the application and notify the employer, or the employer's  authorized agent or representative. ETA shall notify the employer in  writing of the reason(s) that the application is invalidated. When a  labor condition application is invalidated, such action shall be the  final decision of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspension of a labor condition application may result from a  discovery by ETA that it made an error in certifying the application  because such application is incomplete, contains one or more obvious  inaccuracies, or has not been signed. In such event, ETA shall  immediately notify DHS and the   employer. When an application is suspended, the employer may immediately  submit to the certifying officer a corrected or completed application.  If ETA does not receive a corrected application within 30 days of the  suspension, or if the employer was disqualified by the Administrator,  the application shall be immediately invalidated as described in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employer shall comply with the ``required wages rate'' and  ``prevailing working conditions'' statements of its labor condition  application required under Sec. Sec. 655.731 and 655.732 of this part,  respectively, even if such application is suspended or invalidated, at  any time H-1B nonimmigrants are employed pursuant to the application,  unless the application is superseded by a subsequent application which  is certified by ETA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employer's obligation to comply with the ``no strike or  lockout'' and ``notice'' statements of its labor condition application  (required under Sec. Sec. 655.733 and 655.734 of this part,  respectively), shall remain in effect and the employer shall remain  subject to investigation and sanctions for misrepresentation on these  statements even if such application is suspended or invalidated,  regardless of whether H-1B nonimmigrants are actually employed, unless  the application is superseded by a subsequent application which is  certified by ETA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employers subject to disqualification. No labor condition  application shall be certified for an employer which has been found to  be disqualified from participation, in the H-1B program as determined in  a final agency action following an investigation by the Wage and Hour  Division pursuant to subpart I of this part.
