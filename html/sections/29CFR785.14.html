                            <p class="depth0">Whether waiting time is time worked under the Act depends upon  particular circumstances. The determination involves ``scrutiny and  construction of the agreements between particular parties, appraisal of  their practical construction of the working agreement by conduct,  consideration of the nature of the service, and its relation to the  waiting time, and all of the circumstances. Facts may show that the  employee was engaged to wait or they may show that he waited to be  engaged.'' (Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134 (1944)) Such questions  ``must be determined in accordance with common sense and the general  concept of work or employment.'' (Central Mo. Tel. Co. v. Conwell, 170  F. 2d 641 (C.A. 8, 1948))</p>
