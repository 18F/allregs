                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of the Assessment is to provide background and justification for an Action Plan. The Action Plan, which is the essential core of the Action Program, must be a clear statement of the community's specific objectives, priorities and implementation strategies in relation to the intent of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program and the local government's overall recreation system goals. The Action Plan should be carefully tailored to the comprehensive community goals and directly responsive to the needs and problems identified in Sec. 72.12. Citizen involvement in the development of the Action Plan is required and may include surveys, hearings, meetings, and/or consultation as appropriate. This involvement is essential in the development of goals, objectives and the setting of project priorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Goals for the System. This section should set forth the overall goals and specific objectives for the system. Goals will clearly relate to the needs and issues identified in the Assessment and must be projected for at least the five-year life of the Action Program. The goals should be consistent with and, where appropriate, included in the general planning goals of the local government. Where local governments have developed, adopted and are utilizing an overall park and recreation plan, the goals of that plan may be appropriate for this requirement. Goals should be the basis for priorities, schedules and implementation strategies stated in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Strategies to Address National and Local Concerns. This section should include a description of local strategies for recreation system recovery. A ``strategy'' defines the total approach to remedying system deficiencies and provides a rationale for priorities reflected in implementation schedules. Strategies should be devised which address the following national concerns:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ways in which park and recreation plans contribute to, and will be interrelated with, the local government's community development and urban revitalization efforts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The degree to which park and recreation plans serve citizens who reside in economically-distressed areas of the community and will improve access to park and recreation facilities and programs for minority groups, low- and moderate-income populations, and the handicapped;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the Action Program and its plan component will relate employment opportunities for minorities, youth and low- and moderate-income residents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How the plan seeks to obtain the widest range of beneficial uses of the natural environment and enhances and protects the natural environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> How park and recreation resources will be targeted in neighborhoods where other neighborhood revitalization efforts are occurring;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> How the plan seeks to restore outstanding or unique structures, landscapes, or similar features in parks of historical or architectural significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects on the neighborhood level which augment recovery of park and recreation systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> How the plan will be intergrated with other Federally assisted projects to maximize recreation opportunities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> How the plan will convert for recreation use, derelict and other public lands not designated for recreation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Inducements to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> How the plan will seek to preserve, restore and develop waterfront areas for recreation and open space.
If any of the above concerns are not of significance within a locality preparing the Recovery Action Program due to lack of the physical attributes described in the above eleven (11) items, the Action Plan should indicate why

such strategies are not appropriate. Most communities will also have their own special concerns and should develop strategies to address them. These should accompany the strategies discussed above and provide a focus for specific recommendations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recommendations. Recommendations for improvement of the park and recreation system should be discussed. Each recommendation or group of recommendations should be accompanied by a discussion of the techniques the local government will use to implement the recommendations. Reference should be made to how the recommendations relate to deficiencies, needs, and opportunities identified in previous sections of the Action Program. A brief physical development plan for the entire park and recreation system should be included. This can be accomplished with a map which indicates where existing facilities and activities occur as well as where future developments are to occur. Particular reference shall be made to populations served and indicated deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Program Priorities and Implementation Schedule. A statement of system priorities and a schedule for implementation shall be included. These priorities, together with justifying objectives and strategies for implementation shall be presented. Priorities presented will be an important factor in the evaluation and approval of requests for UPARR funding. Active and continued citizen participation is necessary throughout the process. Specific projects to be undertaken and the programs to be improved, expanded, introduced, or eliminated through rehabilitation, physical, service, management, and coordination actions should be discussed. A clear assignment of agency responsibility and an estimate of the costs of implementation should accompany these priorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evaluation and Updating of Action Program. This section should outline a specific program for annual monitoring, evaluating, and updating of the complete Action Program, including both improvements needed in the Assessment and the Action Plan. Citizen involvement is essential in the evaluation and monitoring of the Action Program. Copies of approved Action Programs must be readily available to the public to insure adequate opportunities for citizen review and comment.
