                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies vehicle modifications that may occur after a vehicle reaches the end of its regulatory useful life. It does not apply with respect to modifications that occur within the useful life period. It also does not apply with respect to engine modifications or recalibrations. Note that many such modifications to the vehicle during the useful life and to the engine at any time are presumed to violate 42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as allowed by this section, it is prohibited for any person to remove or render inoperative any emission control device installed to comply with the requirements of this part 1037.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allowable modifications. You may modify a vehicle for the purpose of reducing emissions, provided you have a reasonable technical basis for knowing that such modification will not increase emissions of any other pollutant. Reasonable technical basis has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. This generally requires you to have information that would lead an engineer or other person familiar with engine and vehicle design and function to reasonably believe that the modifications will not increase emissions of any regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples of allowable modifications. The following are examples of allowable modifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is generally allowable to remove tractor roof fairings after the end of the vehicle's useful life if the vehicle will no longer be used primarily to pull box trailers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other fairings may be removed after the end of the vehicle's useful life if the vehicle will no longer be used significantly on highways with vehicle speed of 55 miles per hour or higher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples of prohibited modifications. The following are examples of modifications that are not allowable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No person may disable a vehicle speed limiter prior to its expiration point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No person may remove aerodynamic fairings from tractors that are used primarily to pull box trailers on highways.</p>
