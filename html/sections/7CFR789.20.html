                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> APAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, if production or delivery problems arise, a person should immediately contact the Farm Service Agency Administrator for special priorities assistance pursuant to Sec. Sec.  789.20 through 789.24 and as directed by Sec.  789.73. If the Farm Service Agency is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, USDA may forward the request to another resource agency, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate problems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite

deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted on Form AD-2102 (OMB Control Number 0560-0280) to the Farm Service Agency as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Form AD-2102 may be obtained from USDA by downloading the form and instructions from http://forms.sc.egov.usda.gov/eForms/welcomeAction.do?Home or by contacting the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency as specified in Sec.  789.73. Either mail or fax the form to USDA, using the address or fax number shown on the form.</p>
