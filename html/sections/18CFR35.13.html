If any of the proposed estimation techniques require data that are not provided elsewhere in the cost of service statements in paragraph (h) of this section, the utility shall supply the necessary data in Statement AE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Statement AF--Specified deferred credits. Statement AF consists of balances of specified accounts and items which are to be considered in the determination of the net original cost rate base. All required balances are to be stated as of the beginning and end of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the beginning and end balances for each period. If any of the Period I and Period II balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current operating plan of the utility, the utility shall include an explanation of the relevant circumstances.

Statement BK is a statement of the claimed fully allocated cost of service of the utility developed and shown for Period I and Period II. The utility shall include analytical support for each rate proposed to be differentiated on a time-of-use basis. The utility shall also provide any marginal or incremental cost information that is required to support the changed rate

developed on a marginal or incremental cost basis. The utility shall show allocations of fully distributed costs to the wholesale services subject to the changed rate accompanied by a comparison of allocated costs with revenues under the changed rate. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude use by any utility of any cost of service technique it believes reasonable and that is consistent with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The utility shall base the fully distributed cost of service and the allocations thereof upon data provided in the accompanying detailed statements required under this section and additional data which the utility may submit and support in connection with this statement. The cost of service data of the utility shall conform to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total electric rate base and cost of service shall be itemized and summarized by major functions and in a format designed to facilitate review and analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Based on the total electric rate base and cost of service, and on allocated or assigned component elements, the cost of service for each Statement BA wholesale customer rate group under paragraph (h)(26) shall be itemized and summarized by major functions in a format consistent with that shown for total electric.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The costs of service data for total electric and for each of the wholesale customer groups shall include data that show the return and the income taxes by components and in total, based upon the rate of return claimed by the utility in Statement AV under paragraph (h)(22). Individual components of income taxes shall include income taxes payable, provision for deferred income tax--debits and deferred income tax--credits, investment tax credits, or other adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The fully distributed cost of service study of the utility shall disclose the principal determinants for allocation of total electric costs among the wholesale customer groups, including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Computations showing the energy responsibilities of the wholesale services, with supporting detail;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computations showing the demand responsibilities of the wholesale services, with supporting detail; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computations showing the specific assignment responsibilities of the wholesale services, with supporting detail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the total electric service and for each wholesale customer rate group, the utility shall compare the fully distributed cost of service with the revenues under the changed rate. Based on the comparison, the utility shall show the revenue excess or deficiency and the earned rate of return computed for the total electric service and for each wholesale customer rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For any filing that contains Period II data, the utility shall supply any work papers and additional explanatory material necessary to support Statement BK, indexed, referenced and paginated as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The utility shall provide a tabular comparison of Period II total electric fully distributed cost items with those of Period I. The comparisons shall show item amounts for each of the two periods, and also shall show Period II item amounts as percentages of equivalent items for Period I. Comparisons shall include at least the following items, accompanied by explanatory notes with respect to significant variations among the comparative percentages:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rate base;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Production expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Transmission expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Customer accounting, customer service and information, and sales expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Depreciation expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Taxes except income and revenue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Income taxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Revenue taxes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Return claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(37)</em> Statement BL--Rate design information. In support of the design of the changed rate, the utility shall submit the following material:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A narrative statement describing and justifying the objectives of the design of the changed rate. If the purpose of the rate design is to reflect costs, the utility shall state how that objective is achieved, and shall accompany

it with a summary cost analysis that would justify the rate design, including any discounts or surcharges based on delivery voltage level or other specific considerations. Such summary cost analysis shall be consistent with, derived from, and cross-referenced to the data in cost of service Statement BK. If the rate design is not intended to reflect costs, whether fully distributed, marginal, incremental, or other, the utility shall provide a statement to justify the departure from cost-based rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the billing determinants, such as quantities of demand, energy, or delivery points, are on different bases than the cost allocation determinants supporting such charges, the utility shall submit an explanation setting forth the economic or other considerations that warrant such departure. The information shall include at least the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the individual rate for the demand, energy and customer charges do not correspond to the comparable cost classifications supporting such charges, a detailed explanation stating the reasons for the differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the changed rate contains more than one demand or energy block, a detailed explanation indicating the rationale for the blocking and the considerations upon which such blocking is based, including adequate cost support for the specified blocking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(38)</em> Statement BM--Construction program statement. Statement BM is a summary of data and supporting assumptions relating to the economics of any construction program to replace or expand the utility's power supply that shall be filed if the utility is filing for construction work in progress in rate base under Sec. 35.26(c)(3) of this chapter. The filing utility shall describe generally its program for providing reliable and economic power for the period beginning with the date of the filing and ending with the tenth year after the test period. The statement shall include an assessment of the relative costs of adopting alternative strategies including an analysis of alternative production plant, e.g., cogeneration, small power production, heightened load management and conservation efforts, additions to transmission plant or increased purchases of power, and an explanation of why the program adopted is prudent and consistent with a least-cost energy supply program.
