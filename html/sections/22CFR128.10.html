Where the Administrative Law Judge finds that a violation has been committed, the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation shall be advisory only. The Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs will review the record, consider the report of the Administrative Law Judge, and make an appropriate disposition of the case. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade Controls may issue an order debarring the respondent from participating in the export of defense articles or technical data or the furnishing of defense services as provided in Sec. 127.7 of this subchapter, impose a civil penalty as provided in Sec. 127.10 of this subchapter, or take such action as the Administrative Law Judge may recommend. Any debarment order will be effective for the period of time specified therein and may contain such additional terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate. A copy of the order together with a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be served upon the respondent.
