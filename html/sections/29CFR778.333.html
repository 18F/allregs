                            <p class="depth0">The question has been raised whether awards made to employees for  suggestions submitted under a suggestion system plan are to be regarded  as part of the regular rate. There is no hard and fast rule on this  point as the term ``suggestion system'' has been used to describe a  variety of widely differing plans. It may be generally stated, however,  that prizes paid pursuant to a bona fide suggestion system plan may be  excluded from the regular rate at least in situations where it is the  fact that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The amount of the prize has no relation to the earnings of the  employee at his job but is rather geared to the value to the company of  the suggestion which is submitted; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The prize represents a bona fide award for a suggestion which is  the result of additional effort or ingenuity unrelated to and outside  the scope of the usual and customary duties of any employee of the class  eligible to participate and the prize is not used as a substitute for  wages; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No employee is required or specifically urged to participate in  the suggestion system plan or led to believe that he will not merit  promotion or advancement (or retention of his existing job) unless he  submits suggestions; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The invitation to employees to submit suggestions is general in  nature and no specific assignment is outlined to employees (either as  individuals or as a group) to work on or develop; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There is no time limit during which suggestions must be  submitted; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The employer has, prior to the submission of the suggestion by  an employee, no notice or knowledge of the fact that an employee is  working on the preparation of a suggestion under circumstances  indicating that the company approved the task and the schedule of work  undertaken by the employee.</p>
