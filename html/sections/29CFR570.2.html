The Act sets a 16-year age minimum for employment in agriculture during school hours for the school district in which the employed minor is living at the time, and also for employment in any occupation in agriculture that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous except where such employee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person (see Subpart E-1 of this part). There is a minimum age requirement of 14 years generally for employment in agriculture outside school hours for the school district where such employee is living while so employed. However, (1) a minor 12 or 13 years of age may be so employed with written consent of his parent or person standing in place of his parent, or may work on a farm where such parent or person is also employed, and (2) a minor under 12 years of age may be employed by his parent or by a person standing in place of his parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person, or may be employed with consent of such parent or person on a farm where all employees are exempt from the minimum wage provisions by virtue of section 13(a) (6) (A) of the Act.</p>
