                            <p class="depth0">Section 4231(b)(2) of ERISA and Sec. 4231.3(a)(1) require that no  participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit may be lower immediately  after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit  immediately before the merger or transfer. A plan that assumes an  obligation to pay benefits for a group of participants satisfies this  requirement only if the plan contains a provision preserving all accrued  benefits. The determination of what is an accrued benefit must be made  in accordance with section 411 of the Code and the regulations  thereunder.</p>
