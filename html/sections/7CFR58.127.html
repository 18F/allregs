                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Water supply. There shall be an ample supply of both hot and cold water of safe and sanitary quality, with adequate facilities for its proper distribution throughout the plant, and protected against contamination. Water from other facilities, when officially approved, may be used for boiler feed water and condenser water provided that such water lines are completely separated from the water lines carrying the sanitary water supply, and the equipment is so constructed and controlled as to preclude contamination of product contact surfaces. There shall be no cross connection between potable water lines and non-potable water lines or between public and

private water supplies. Bacteriological examinations shall be made of the plant's sanitary water supply taken at the plant at least twice a year, or as often as necessary to determine safety and suitability as related to product keeping quality for use in manufactured products shall be made by a USDA or State agency laboratory except for supplies that are regularly tested for purity and bacteriological quality, and approved by the local health officer. The results of all water tests shall be kept on file at the plant for which the test was performed.
The location, construction, and operation of any well shall comply with regulations of the appropriate agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drinking-water facilities. Drinking-water facilities of a sanitary type shall be provided in the plant and should be conveniently located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hand-washing facilities. Convenient hand-washing facilities shall be provided, including hot and cold running water, soap or other detergents, and sanitary single service towels or air driers. Such accommodations shall be located in or adjacent to toilet and dressing rooms and also at such other places in the plant as may be essential to the cleanliness of all personnel handling products. Vats for washing equipment or utensils shall not be used as hand-washing facilities. Containers shall be provided for used towels and other wastes. The containers may be metal or plastic, disposable or reuseable and should have self-closing covers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Steam. Steam shall be supplied in sufficient volume and pressure for satisfactory operation of each applicable piece of equipment. Culinary steam used in direct contact with milk or dairy products shall be free from harmful substances or extraneous material and only those boiler water additives that meet the requirements of 21 CFR 173.310 shall be used, or a secondary steam generator shall be used in which soft water is converted to steam and no boiler compounds are used. Steam traps, strainers, and condensate traps shall be used wherever applicable to insure a satisfactory and safe steam supply. Culinary steam shall comply with the 3-A Accepted Practices for a Method of Producing Steam of Culinary Quality, number 609. This document is available from the International Association for Food Protection, 6200 Aurora Avenue, Suite 200 W, Des Moines, Iowa 50322-2863.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Air under pressure. The method for supplying air under pressure, which comes in contact with milk or dairy products or any product contact surface shall comply with the 3-A Accepted Practices for Supplying Air Under Pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposal of wastes. Dairy wastes shall be properly disposed of from the plant and premises consistent with requirements imposed by the Environmental Protection Act. The sewer system shall have sufficient slope and capacity to readily remove all waste from the various processing operations. Where a public sewer is not available, all wastes shall be properly disposed of so as not to contaminate milk equipment or to create a nuisance or public health hazard. Containers used for the collection and holding of wastes shall be constructed of metal, plastic, or other equally impervious material and kept covered with tight fitting lids. Waste shall be stored in an area or room in a manner to protect it from flies and vermin. Solid wastes shall be disposed of regularly and the containers cleaned before reuse. Accumulation of dry waste paper and cardboard shall be kept to a minimum and disposed of in a manner that is environmentally acceptable.
