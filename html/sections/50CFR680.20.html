For each crab QS fishery, the Arbitration QS/IFQ Arbitration  Organizations and PQS/IPQ Arbitration Organizations shall establish a  contract with all Contract Arbitrators in that fishery that specifies  that each Contract Arbitrator may be selected to resolve a dispute  concerning the terms of delivery, price, or other factors in the  fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selection of Contract Arbitrators. The contract with the  Contract Arbitrator shall specify the means by which the Contract  Arbitrator will be selected to resolve specific disputes. This contract  must specify that for any dispute for which the Contract Arbitrator is  selected, the Contract Arbitrator will comply with the last best offer  arbitration method as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Negotiation and Binding Arbitration Procedure. The contract with  the Contract Arbitrator(s) shall specify the following approaches for  negotiation and Binding Arbitration among members of the Arbitration  Organizations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Restrictions on collective negotiation. An IFQ and an IPQ holder  may negotiate individually. Groups of IFQ holders may negotiate  collectively with an IPQ holder only under the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Members of an FCMA cooperatives may participate collectively  with other members of the same FCMA cooperative in Binding Arbitration  except as otherwise provided under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Members of different FCMA cooperatives shall not participate  collectively in Binding Arbitration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> IPQ holders shall not participate collectively. Only one IPQ  holder shall enter into Binding Arbitration with any IFQ holder or IFQ  holder(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An Arbitration Organization must not negotiate on behalf of a  member. This shall not prohibit the members of an Arbitration IFQ  Arbitration Organization from negotiation if the Arbitration  Organization qualifies as an FCMA cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Open negotiations. At any time prior to the date of the first  crab fishing season of a crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery, any  holder of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may negotiate with any holder of  uncommitted IPQ, the price and delivery terms for that season for any  uncommitted IFQ and uncommitted IPQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Uncommitted Arbitration IFQ holders and Uncommitted IPQ holders  may freely contact each other and initiate open negotiations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If Arbitration IFQ holders and IPQ holders do not reach an  agreement on price, delivery terms, or other terms after committing  shares, an Arbitration IFQ holder may initiate Binding Arbitration in  accordance with the procedures specified in this section in order to  resolve disputes in those price, delivery terms, or other terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Once IFQ or IPQ has been committed, the IFQ holder and IPQ  holder cannot engage in open negotiation using those shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lengthy season approach. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prior to the date of the first  crab fishing season for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year a  committed IPQ holder and one or more committed Arbitration IFQ holders  may choose to adopt a Lengthy Season approach. The Lengthy Season  approach is an alternative method to the Binding Arbitration  proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Lengthy Season approach allows a committed IPQ holder and a  committed Arbitration IFQ holder to agree to postpone negotiation of  specific contract terms until a time during the crab fishing year as  agreed upon by the Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder participating  in the negotiation. The Lengthy Season approach allows the Arbitration  IFQ holders and IPQ holder involved in the negotiation to postpone  Binding Arbitration, if necessary, until a time during the crab fishing  year. If the parties ready a final agreement on the contract terms,  Binding Arbitration is not necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a committed IPQ holder and one or more committed Arbitration  IFQ holder(s) are unable to reach an agreement on whether to adopt a  Lengthy Season approach, they may request mediation to assist the  parties in determining whether to adopt a Lengthy Season approach. The  parties may request a Contract Arbitrator to act as a mediator. If the  mediation proves unsuccessful or is not selected, the Arbitration IFQ  holder may initiate enter Binding Arbitration to determine whether to  adopt a lengthy season approach.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Binding Arbitration may begin immediately with the same Contract  Arbitrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Contract Arbitrator serves as a mediator in an  unsuccessful mediation, either party may request another Contract  Arbitrator for the Binding Arbitration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Share matching. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At any time 120 hours (five days) after  NMFS issues IFQ and IPQ for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing  year, holders of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may choose to commit the  delivery of harvests of crab to be made with that uncommitted  Arbitration IFQ to an uncommitted IPQ holder. The issuance of IFQ and  IPQ for a crab QS fishery occurs on the time and date that IFQ and IPQ  amounts for that crab QS fishery are posted on the NMFS, Alaska Region  website at http://www.fakr.noaa.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To commit Arbitration IFQ, the holder of uncommitted IFQ must  offer an amount of Arbitration IFQ:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not less than 50 percent of the Arbitration IFQ holder's total  uncommitted Arbitration IFQ, or an amount of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ  equal to the total amount of uncommitted IPQ available, whichever is  less, if the Arbitration IFQ holder is not an FCMA cooperative; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not less than 25 percent of the Arbitration IFQ holder's total  uncommitted Arbitration IFQ, or an amount of   uncommitted Arbitration IFQ equal to the total amount of uncommitted IPQ  available, whichever is less, if the Arbitration IFQ holder is an FCMA  cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any holder of uncommitted IPQ must accept all proposed  Arbitration IFQ commitments, up to the amount of its uncommitted IPQ.  The commitment of IPQ will take place on receipt of notice from the  holder of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ of the intention to commit that  IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> After matching, an Arbitration IFQ holder and an IPQ holder may  decide to enter mediation to reach agreement on contract terms. The  Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder may request a Contract Arbitrator  to act as a mediator to facilitate an agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the mediation proves unsuccessful, or if mediation is not  selected, the Arbitration IFQ holder may initiate Binding Arbitration  which may begin immediately with the same Contract Arbitrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Contract Arbitrator serves as a mediator in an  unsuccessful mediation, the Arbitration IFQ holder may request another  Contract Arbitrator for the Binding Arbitration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Initiation of Binding Arbitration. If an Arbitration IFQ holder  intends to initiate Binding Arbitration, the Arbitration IFQ holder must  initiate the Binding Arbitration procedure not later than 360 hours (15  days) after NMFS issues IFQ and IPQ for that crab QS fishery in that  crab fishing year. Binding Arbitration is initiated after the committed  Arbitration IFQ holder notifies a committed IPQ holder and selects a  Contract Arbitrator. Binding Arbitration may be initiated to resolve  price, terms of delivery, and other disputes. There will be only one  Binding Arbitration Proceeding for an IPQ holder but multiple  Arbitration IFQ holders may participate in this proceeding. This  limitation on the timing of Binding Arbitration proceedings does not  include proceedings that arise due to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The lengthy season approach;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Performance disputes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Quality disputes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Joining a Binding Arbitration proceeding. Any uncommitted  Arbitration IFQ holder may join a Binding Arbitration proceeding as a  party by committing the shares to the arbitration and providing notice  to the IPQ holder and the Contract Arbitrator(s). An Arbitration IFQ  holder may join a Binding Arbitration proceeding only if uncommitted IPQ  is available. Once shares are committed to a Binding Arbitration  Proceeding they cannot be uncommitted. The contract with the Contract  Arbitrator may specify the terms and timing of joining the proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Arbitration schedule meeting. The Contract Arbitrator shall  meet with all parties to a Binding Arbitration proceeding as soon as  possible once a Binding Arbitration proceeding has been initiated for  the sole purpose of establishing a schedule for the Binding Arbitration.  This schedule shall include the date by which the IPQ holder and  Arbitration IFQ holder(s) must submit their last best offer and any  supporting materials, and any additional meetings or mediation if agreed  to by all parties. This meeting will discuss the schedule of the Binding  Arbitration proceedings and not address terms of last best offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Terms of last best offers. The Contract Arbitrator will meet  with the parties to the Binding Arbitration proceeding to determine the  matters that must be included in the last best offer, which may include  a fixed price or a price over a time period specified by the parties, a  method for adjusting prices over a crab fishing year, or an advance  price paid at the time of delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Submission of last best offers. The parties to a Binding  Arbitration proceeding shall each submit to the Contract Arbitrator(s) a  last best offer defining all the terms specified for inclusion in a last  best offer by the Contract Arbitrator. An Arbitration IFQ holder that is  an FCMA cooperative may submit a last best offer that defines terms for  the delivery of crab harvested by members of that FCMA cooperative with  IFQ held by the cooperative. An Arbitration IFQ holder that is not an  FCMA cooperative may submit a last best offer that defines the term of  delivery of crab harvested with IFQ held by that person. The IPQ holder  that is a party to the proceeding shall submit   a single offer that defines terms for delivery of crab harvested with  all IFQ that are subject to the proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Arbitration decisions. The Contract Arbitrator(s) shall decide  among each offer received from an Arbitration IFQ holder and the offer  received from the IPQ holder. Each arbitration decision shall result in  a binding contract between the IPQ holder and the Arbitration IFQ holder  defined by the terms of the offer selected by Contract Arbitrator(s). An  arbitration decision applies to all committed IFQ and committed IPQ in  that arbitration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Announcement of decisions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If last best offers are  submitted at least 15 days before the first crab fishing season for that  crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery, arbitration decisions shall  be issued no later than 10 days before the first crab fishing season for  that crab fishing year for that crab QS fishery. Otherwise, the Contract  Arbitrator will notify the parties of the arbitration decision within 5  days of the parties submitting their last best offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Contract Arbitrator will notify the parties by providing  each Arbitration IFQ holder and IPQ holder that is a party to the  Binding Arbitration proceeding, a copy of any decision. The decision is  binding on the parties to the Binding Arbitration proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Basis for the Arbitration decision. The contract with the  Contract Arbitrator shall specify that the Contract Arbitrator will be  subject to the following provisions when deciding which last best offer  to select.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Contract Arbitrator's decision shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be based on the historical distribution of first wholesale  revenues between fishermen and processors in the aggregate based on  arm's length first wholesale prices and ex-vessel prices, taking into  consideration the size of the harvest in each year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Establish a price that preserves the historical division of  revenues in the fishery while considering the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current ex-vessel prices, including ex-vessel prices received  for crab harvested under Class A IFQ, Class B IFQ, and CVC IFQ permits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consumer and wholesale product prices for the processing sector  and the participants in the arbitration (recognizing the impact of sales  to affiliates on wholesale pricing);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Innovations and developments of the harvesting and processing  sectors and the participants in the arbitration (including new product  forms);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Efficiency and productivity of the harvesting and processing  sectors (recognizing the limitations on efficiency and productivity  arising out of the management program structure);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Quality (including quality standards of markets served by the  fishery and recognizing the influence of harvest strategies on the  quality of landings);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The interest of maintaining financially healthy and stable  harvesting and processing sectors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Safety and expenditures for ensuring adequate safety;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Timing and location of deliveries; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The cost of harvesting and processing less than the full IFQ or  IPQ allocation (underages) to avoid penalties for overharvesting IFQ and  a mechanism for reasonably accounting for deadloss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Consider the Non-Binding Price Formula established in the  fishery by the Formula Arbitrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contract Arbitrator's decision may rely on any relevant  information available to the Contract Arbitrator, including, but not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Information provided by the QS, PQS, IPQ and IFQ holders in the  fishery regarding the factors identified in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Market Report for the fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each of the Arbitration IFQ holders and the IPQ holders that  is party to the proceeding may provide the Contract Arbitrator with  additional information to support its last best offer. The Contract  Arbitrator must receive and consider all data submitted by the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Contract Arbitrator may request specific information from  the Arbitration IFQ holder(s) and IPQ holder that will be useful in  reaching a final decision. The Contract Arbitrator will not have  subpoena power and it is in   the sole discretion of the person from whom information is requested as  to whether to provide the requested information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Limits on the release of data. The parties to a Binding  Arbitration proceeding shall be precluded from full access to the  information provided to the Contract Arbitrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Arbitration IFQ holders that are party to an arbitration  proceeding shall have access only to information provided directly by  the IPQ holder to the Contract Arbitrator for that Binding Arbitration  proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> IPQ holders that are party to an arbitration proceeding shall  have access only to information provided directly by an Arbitration IFQ  holder to the Contract Arbitrator for that Binding Arbitration  proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Contract Arbitrator shall keep confidential the  information provided by any QS, PQS, IFQ, or IPQ holders in the fishery  and not disclose the identity of the persons providing specific  information except as provided in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Arbitration IFQ holders and IPQ holders shall not release  information received in a Binding Arbitration proceeding to persons who  were not party to that Binding Arbitration proceeding other than the  final result of that arbitration proceeding except as provided for in  paragraph (h)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Information provided to NMFS. The Contract Arbitrator must  provide any information, documents, or data required under this  paragraph to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section  not later than 30 days prior to the end of the crab fishing year for  which the open negotiation or arbitration applied. The contract with the  Contract Arbitrator must specify that the Contract Arbitrator provide  NMFS with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A copy of any minutes from any meeting attended by that Contract  Arbitrator between or among any PQS or IPQ holders concerning any  negotiations under this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any last-best offers made during the Binding Arbitration  process, including all contract details, the names of other participants  in the arbitration, and whether the bid was accepted by the Contract  Arbitrator; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of any information, data, or documents given by the  Contract Arbitrator to any person who is not a party to the particular  arbitration for which that information was provided. The Contract  Arbitrator must identify the arbitration to which the information, data,  or documents apply, and the person to whom those information, data, or  documents were provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Enforcement of Binding Arbitration decisions. The decision of  the Contract Arbitrator for Binding Arbitration shall be enforced among  the parties to that arbitration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Failure of Contract Arbitrator(s). Except as provided for in  paragraph (h)(6) of this section, the failure of a Contract Arbitrator  to perform shall be enforced by the Arbitration Organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Post Binding Arbitration opt-in. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An Arbitration IFQ holder  with uncommitted IFQ, may opt-in to any contract that results from a  completed a Binding Arbitration procedure with any IPQ holder that has  uncommitted IPQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All the terms from the arbitrated contract will apply. The  Contract Arbitrator may determine fees and a time frame by which a Post  Binding Arbitration opt-in may occur if those terms are not specified in  the arbitrated contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Once exercised, the opt-in results in a contract that is binding  on both the Arbitration IFQ and IPQ holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To initiate the opt-in process, the holder of uncommitted  Arbitration IFQ will notify the holder of uncommitted IPQ in writing of  its intent to opt-in.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Holders of uncommitted Arbitration IFQ may opt-in to a  contract resulting from a completed Binding Arbitration procedure with a  person that holds uncommitted IPQ for that fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the IPQ holder and the Arbitration IFQ holder are unable to  resolve a dispute regarding whether the opt-in offer is consistent with  the original contract from the completed Binding Arbitration procedure,  the dispute may be decided by the Contract Arbitrator to the original  arbitration that resulted in the contract to which the Arbitration IFQ  holder is seeking   to opt-in. The Contract Arbitrator will decide only whether the proposed  opt-in terms are consistent with the original contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Performance disputes. If an IPQ holder and an Arbitration IFQ  holder are unable to resolve disputes regarding the obligations to  perform specific contract provisions after substantial negotiations or  when time is of the essence, the issues of that dispute shall be  submitted for Binding Arbitration before a Contract Arbitrator for that  fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Binding Arbitration resulting from a performance dispute can  occur at any point during or after the crab fishing year. The dispute  must be raised by the IPQ holder or the Arbitration IFQ holder.  Arbitration of that performance dispute must be initiated prior to the  date of the first crab fishing season for the following crab fishing  year in that crab QS fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Performance dispute arbitration shall follow the applicable  procedures described for a Binding Arbitration in paragraph (h)(3) of  this section, except that the time frame for the procedure applicable to  a performance dispute will be determined by the Contract Arbitrator once  the dispute has been raised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a party fails to abide by the arbitration decision, a party  may pursue available contract remedies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The costs of arbitrating performance disputes shall be provided  from the general fees collected by the Arbitration Organizations  pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Contract Arbitrator may assign fees to any party bringing  frivolous complaints.

When disputes regarding the quality of the  harvested crab arise within the context of an existing contract, the  parties may settle the disputes within the context of the arbitration  system according to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In cases where the IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) have  agreed to a formula-based price for crab but where they cannot reach an  agreement on the quality and price of the crab, the IPQ holder and  Arbitration IFQ holder(s) will receive their share of the value of the  amount of crab delivered based on the provisions of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In quality disputes where the Arbitration IFQ holders prefer to  use actual ex-vessel price and not a formula-based price and a dispute  arises regarding crab quality and price, the dispute should be referred  to a mutually agreeable independent quality specialist firm. This  independent quality specialist firm will determine the quality of the  crab. This information will be used as the basis for subsequent price  determinations. The IPQ holder and Arbitration IFQ holder(s) with this  quality dispute shall share the cost of hiring the specialist firm and  agree to abide by its findings according to the terms of their  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Other procedures and administrative decisions. The Arbitration  Organizations, Market Analyst, Contract Arbitrator, Formula Arbitrator,  and the Third Party Data Provider are authorized to adopt arbitration  system procedures and make administrative decisions, including  additional provisions in the various contracts, provided those actions  are not inconsistent with any other provision in the regulations.
