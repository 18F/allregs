The employee  may not have access to classified information until receipt of written  confirmation of reinstatement and an up-to-date personnel security  packet will be furnished with the request for reinstatement of an access  authorization. A new Security Acknowledgement will be obtained in all  cases. Where personnel security packets are not required, a request for  reinstatement must state the level of access authorization to be  reinstated and the full name and date of birth of the individual to  establish positive identification. A fee, equal to the amount paid for  an initial request, will be charged only if a new or updating  investigation by the NRC is required.  [62 FR 17689, Apr. 11, 1997]</p>
