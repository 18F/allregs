The GAO official is not required to gather supporting evidence for the individual and will have the right to verify the evidence which the individual submits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment of a record will be denied upon a determination by the system manager or designee that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The record is subject to an exemption from the provisions of this part, allowing amendment of records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information submitted by the data subject is not accurate, relevant, or of sufficient probative value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amendment would violate a statute or regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The individual refuses to provide information which is necessary to process the request to amend the record; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The record for which amendment is requested is a record presented in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or maintained in anticipation of being used in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, when such record is or will become available to the individual under that proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If, after review, the Assistant Comptroller General for Human Resources also refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual will be permitted to file with the system manager or designee of the system of records concerned a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement. Any such statement of disagreement will be treated in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 83.15.</p>
