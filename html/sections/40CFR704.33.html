standard in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First standard. A processor of a chemical substance is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company, if any, are less than $40 million. However, if the annual processing volume of a particular chemical substance at any individual site owned or controlled by the processor is greater than 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds), the processor shall not qualify as small for purposes of reporting on the processing of that chemical substance at that site, unless the processor qualifies as small under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second standard. A processor of a chemical substance is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $4 million, regardless of the quantity of the particular chemical substance processed by that company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inflation index. EPA shall use the Inflation Index described in the definition of small manufacturer that is set forth in Sec. 704.3, for purposes of adjusting the total annual sales values of this small processor definition. EPA shall provide Federal Register notification when changing the total annual sales values of this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons who must report. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following persons are subject to the reporting requirements of this rule; a person may become subject to this rule more than once, for more than one substance or under more than one of the criteria listed in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons who manufactured, imported, or processed P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB for commercial purposes during the person's latest complete corporate fiscal year prior to June 25, 1986. For purposes of this provision, processors of P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB shall include only those persons who processed the substances other than as non-isolated intermediates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Persons who commence manufacture or importation of P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB for commercial purposes after June 25, 1986. This provision is applicable to persons who cease manufacture or importation of P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB after June 25, 1986 and then subsequently resume manufacture or importation of the substance(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Persons who process P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB for commercial purposes in any way other than as a non-isolated intermediate after June 25, 1986.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons not subject to this rule.

The import site may in some cases be the organization's headquarters office in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All manufacturers, importers, and processors specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall report their name and headquarters address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All manufacturers, importers, and processors specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall report the name, address, and office telephone number (including area code) of their principal technical contact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All manufacturers, importers, and processors specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall report the name and address of each site where P-TBBA, P-TBT, and/or P-TBB is manufactured, imported, or processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All manufacturers, importers, and processors specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section only shall report the information described in this paragraph (d)(4). Respondents to this paragraph (d)(4) shall report separately for each substance that they manufacture, import, or process, and for each site at which they do so. However, if the information to be reported in response to this paragraph (d)(4) is the same for different sites, the respondent need not report separately for each site but need only notify EPA that the information

is the same for each site. The information to be reported under this paragraph (d)(4) shall cover the respondent's latest complete corporate fiscal year prior to June 25, 1986. Respondents to this paragraph (d)(4) shall report the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total quantity (by weight) of P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB manufactured, imported, or processed for commercial purposes per site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative description of the manufacturing, importing, or processing operation(s) involving P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB at each site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A narrative description of worker activities involving P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB at each site, including the number of workers potentially exposed to each substance and, if applicable, the number of workers potentially exposed to more than one substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The potential routes of worker exposure to P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB at each site (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Available monitoring data from employee breathing zones with potential exposure to P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB at each site, including a description of the method of monitoring, the number of samples taken, and the potential number of workers similarly exposed for each worker job category.

The data reported under this paragraph (d)(5) shall cover that 2-year period. Respondents to this paragraph (d)(5) shall report separately for each site at which they intend to manufacture, import, or process each substance. Respondents need not comply with this paragraph (d)(5) if the information to be reported is identical to that reported by the respondent under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, provided that the respondent makes note of that fact to EPA. Respondents to this paragraph (d)(5) shall report the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An estimate of the total quantity (by weight) of P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB that the respondent intends to manufacture, import, or process for commercial purposes per site during each of the first 2 years following the date on which the respondent becomes subject to this rule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative description of the intended manufacturing, importing, or processing activities involving P-TBBA, P-TBT, or P-TBB at each site
