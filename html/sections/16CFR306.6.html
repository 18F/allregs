                            <p class="depth0">In each transfer you make to anyone who is not a consumer, you must  certify the automotive fuel rating of the automotive fuel consistent  with your determination. You can do this in either of two ways:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Include a delivery ticket or other paper with each transfer of  automotive fuel. It may be an invoice, bill of lading, bill of sale,  terminal ticket, delivery ticket, or any other written proof of  transfer. It must contain at least these four items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your name;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the person to whom the automotive fuel is  transferred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of the transfer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The automotive fuel rating. Octane rating numbers may be rounded  off to a whole or half number equal to or less than the number  determined by you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Give the person a letter or other written statement. This letter  must include the date, your name, the other person's name, and the  automotive fuel rating of any automotive fuel you will transfer to that  person from the date of the letter onwards. Octane rating numbers may be  rounded to a whole or half number equal to or less than the number  determined by you. This letter of certification will be good until you  transfer automotive fuel with a lower automotive fuel rating, except  that a letter certifying the fuel rating of biomass-based diesel,  biodiesel, a biomass-based diesel blend, or a biodiesel blend will be  good only until you transfer those fuels with a different automotive  fuel rating, whether the rating is higher or lower. When this happens,  you must certify the automotive fuel rating of the new automotive fuel  either with a delivery ticket or by sending a new letter of  certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When you transfer automotive fuel to a common carrier, you must  certify the automotive fuel rating of the automotive fuel to the common  carrier, either by letter or on the delivery ticket or other paper.
