Sec. 1211.300 through 1211.310 do not apply, or an entity, not a recipient, to which Sec. Sec. 1211.300 through 1211.310 would not apply if the entity were a recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific prohibitions. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 1211.400 through 1211.455, in providing any aid, benefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis of sex:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treat one person differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide different aid, benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subject any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Apply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a student or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students or employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assistance administered by a recipient educational institution to study at a foreign institution.

from either domestic or foreign sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Aids, benefits or services not provided by recipient.
