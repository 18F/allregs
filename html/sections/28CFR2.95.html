                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Upon its own motion or upon request of a parolee, the Commission

may terminate a parolee's supervision, and legal custody over the parolee, before the sentence expires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon its own motion or upon request of a parolee, the Commission

may terminate a parolee's supervision, and legal custody over the parolee, before the sentence expires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may terminate supervision of a committed youth offender after the offender serves one year on supervision. Upon terminating supervision before the sentence expires, the Commission shall set aside the committed youth offender's conviction and issue a certificate setting aside the conviction instead of a certificate of termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Two years after releasing a prisoner on supervision, and at least annually thereafter, the Commission shall review the status of the parolee to determine the need for continued supervision. The Commission shall also conduct a status review whenever the supervision officer recommends early termination of the parolee's supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Five years after releasing a prisoner on supervision, the Commission shall terminate supervision over the parolee unless the Commission determines, after a hearing conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 4214(a)(2), that such supervision should not be terminated because there is a likelihood that the parolee will engage in conduct violating any criminal law. If the Commission does not terminate supervision under this paragraph, the parolee may request a hearing annually thereafter, and the Commission shall conduct an early termination hearing at least every two years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In calculating the two-year and five-year periods provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Commission shall not include any period of parole before the most recent release, or any period the parolee served in confinement on any other sentence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> In determining whether to grant early termination from supervision, the Commission shall consider the guidelines of this paragraph (e). The guidelines are advisory and the Commission may disregard the outcome indicated by the guidelines based on case-specific factors. Termination of supervision is indicated if the parolee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether to grant early termination from supervision, the Commission shall consider the guidelines of this paragraph (e). The guidelines are advisory and the Commission may disregard the outcome indicated by the guidelines based on case-specific factors. Termination of supervision is indicated if the parolee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has a salient factor score in the very good risk category and has completed two continuous years of supervision free from an incident of new criminal behavior or serious parole violation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has a salient factor score in a risk category other than very good and has completed three continuous years of supervision free from an incident of new criminal behavior or serious parole violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in this paragraph (e), the term ``an incident of new criminal behavior or serious parole violation'' includes a new arrest or report of a parole violation if supported by substantial evidence of guilt, even if no conviction or parole revocation results. The Commission shall not terminate supervision of a parolee until it determines the disposition of a pending criminal charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Case-specific factors that may justify a departure either above or below the early termination guidelines may relate to the current behavior of the parolee, or to the parolee's background and criminal history.
