                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The presiding officer shall conduct a full and fair hearing, avoid delay, maintain order, and make a sufficient record of the facts and issues. To accomplish these ends, the presiding officer shall have all powers authorized by law, and may make all procedural and evidentiary rulings necessary for the conduct of the hearing. The hearing shall be open to the public unless the presiding officer for good cause shown otherwise determines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Communications outside the record are prohibited as provided by 45 CFR 16.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Both ACYF and the grantee are entitled to present their case by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such examination and cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of all facts bearing on the issues. The issues shall be those stated in the notice required to be filed by paragraph (g) of this section, those stipulated in a prehearing conference or those agreed to by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prepared written direct testimony will be used in appeals under this part in lieu of oral direct testimony. When the parties submit prepared written direct testimony, witnesses must be available at the hearing for cross-examination and redirect examination. If a party can show substantial hardship in using prepared written direct testimony, the Departmental Appeals Board may exempt it from the requirement. However, such hardship must be more than difficulty in doing so, and it must be shown with respect to each witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition to ACYF, the grantee, and any delegate agencies which have a right to appear, the presiding officer may permit the participation in the proceedings of such persons or organizations as deemed necessary for a proper determination of the issues involved. Such participation may be limited to those issues or activities which the presiding officer believes will meet the needs of the proceeding, and may be limited to the filing of written material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any person or organization that wishes to participate in a proceeding may apply for permission to do so from the Departmental Appeals Board. This application must be made within 30 days of the grantee's appeal in the case of the appeal of termination or denial of refunding, and as soon as possible after the notice of suspension has been received by the grantee. It must state the applicant's interest in the proceeding, the evidence or arguments the applicant intends to contribute, and the necessity for the introduction of such evidence or arguments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The presiding officer shall permit or deny such participation and shall give notice of his or her decision to the applicant, the grantee, and ACYF, and, in the case of denial, a brief statement of the reasons therefor. Even if previously denied, the presiding officer may subsequently permit such participation if, in his or her opinion, it is warranted by subsequent circumstances. If participation is granted, the presiding officer shall notify all parties of that fact and may, in appropriate cases, include in the notification a brief statement of the issues as to which participation is permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Departmental Appeals Board will send the responsible HHS official, the grantee and any other party a notice which states the time, place, nature of the hearing, and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held. The notice will also identify with reasonable specificity and ACYF requirements which the grantee is alleged to have violated. The notice will be served and filed not later than ten work days prior to the hearing.
