Class I locations  include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Class I, Division 1. A Class I, Division 1 location is a  location:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In which ignitable concentrations of flammable gases or vapors  may exist under normal operating conditions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In which ignitable concentrations of such gases or vapors may  exist frequently because of repair or maintenance operations or because  of leakage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In which breakdown or faulty operation of equipment or  processes might release ignitable concentrations of flammable gases or  vapors, and might also cause simultaneous failure of electric equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Note to the definition of ``Class I, Division 1:'' This  classification usually includes locations where volatile flammable  liquids or liquefied flammable gases are transferred from one container  to another; interiors of spray booths and areas in the vicinity of  spraying and painting operations where volatile flammable solvents are  used; locations containing open tanks or vats of volatile flammable  liquids; drying rooms or compartments for the evaporation of flammable  solvents; locations containing fat and oil extraction equipment using  volatile flammable solvents; portions of cleaning and dyeing plants  where flammable liquids are used; gas generator rooms and other portions  of gas manufacturing plants where flammable gas may escape; inadequately  ventilated pump rooms for flammable gas or for volatile flammable  liquids; the interiors of refrigerators and freezers in which volatile  flammable materials are stored in open, lightly stoppered, or easily  ruptured containers; and all other locations where ignitable  concentrations of flammable vapors or gases are likely to occur in the  course of normal operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Class I, Division 2.
