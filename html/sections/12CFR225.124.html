                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective December 1, 1971, the Board of Governors has added a  new Sec. 225.4(g) to Regulation Y implementing its authority under  section 4(c)(9) of the Bank Holding Company Act. The Board's views on  some questions that have arisen in connection with the meaning of terms  used in Sec. 225.4(g) are set forth in paragraphs (b) through (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term ``activities'' refers to nonbanking activities and does  not include the banking activities that foreign banks conduct in the  United States through branches or agencies licensed under the banking  laws of any State of the United States or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A company (including a bank holding company) will not be deemed  to be engaged in ``activities'' in the United States merely because it  exports (or imports) products to (or from) the United States, or  furnishes services or finances goods or services in the United States,  from locations outside the United States. A company is engaged in  ``activities'' in the United States if it owns, leases, maintains,  operates, or controls any of the following types of facilities in the  United States:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A factory,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A wholesale distributor or purchasing agency,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A distribution center,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A retail sales or service outlet,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A network of franchised dealers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A financing agency, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Similar facility for the manufacture, distribution, purchasing,  furnishing, or financing of goods or services locally in the United  States.  A company will not be considered to be engaged in ``activities'' in the  United States if its products are sold to independent importers, or are  distributed through independent warehouses, that are not controlled or  franchised by it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the Board's opinion, section 4 (a)(1) of the Bank Holding  Company Act applies to ownership or control of shares of stock as an  investment and does not apply to ownership or control of shares of stock  in the capacity of an underwriter or dealer in securities. Underwriting  or dealing in shares of stock are nonbanking activities prohibited to  bank holding companies by section 4(a)(2) of the Act, unless otherwise  exempted. Under Sec. 225.4(g) of Regulation Y, foreign bank holding  companies are exempt from the prohibitions of section 4 of the Act with  respect to their activities outside the United States; thus foreign bank  holding companies may underwrite or deal in shares of stock (including  shares of United States issuers) to be distributed outside the United  States, provided that shares so acquired are disposed of within a  reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A foreign bank holding company does not ``indirectly'' own  voting shares by reason of the ownership or control of such voting  shares by any company in which it has a noncontrolling interest. A  foreign bank holding company may, however, ``indirectly'' control such  voting shares if its noncontrolling interest in such company is  accompanied by other arrangements that, in the Board's judgment, result  in control of such shares by the bank holding company. The Board has  made one exception to this general approach. A foreign bank holding  company will be considered to indirectly own or control voting shares of  a bank if that bank holding company acquires more than 5 percent of any  class of voting shares of another bank holding company. A bank holding  company may make such an acquisition only with prior approval of the  Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A company is ``indirectly'' engaged in activities in the United  States if any of its subsidiaries (whether or not incorporated under the  laws of this country) is engaged in such activities. A company is not  ``indirectly'' engaged in activities in the United States by reason of a  noncontrolling interest in a company engaged in such activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Under the foregoing rules, a foreign bank holding company may  have a noncontrolling interest in a foreign company that has a U.S.  subsidiary (but is not engaged in the securities business in the United  States) if more than half of the foreign company's consolidated assets  and revenues are located and derived outside the United States. For the  purpose of such determination, the assets and revenues of the United  States subsidiary would be counted among the consolidated assets and  revenues of the foreign company to the extent required or permitted by  generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The  foreign bank holding company would not, however, be permitted to  ``indirectly'' control voting shares of the said U.S. subsidiary, as  might be the case if there are other arrangements accompanying its  noncontrolling interest in the foreign parent company that, in the  Board's judgment, result in control of   such shares by the bank holding company.  (Interprets and applies 12 U.S.C. 1843 (a) (1), (2), and (c)(9))  [36 FR 21808, Nov. 16, 1971]</p>
