The mentor may receive credit for costs it incurs to provide assistance to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm. The mentor may use this additional credit towards attaining its subcontracting plan participation goal under the same or another DHS contract. The amount of credit given to a mentor firm for these prot[eacute]g[eacute] developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at http://www.esrs.gov. For example, a mentor/large business prime contractor would report a $10,000 subcontract to the prot[eacute]g[eacute]/small business subcontractor and $5,000 of developmental assistance to the prot[eacute]g[eacute]/small business subcontractor as $15,000. The Mentor and Prot[eacute]g[eacute] will submit a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance and the Summary Subcontract Report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contractors interested in participating in the program are encouraged to contact the DHS OSDBU for more information.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
