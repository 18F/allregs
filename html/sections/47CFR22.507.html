                            <p class="depth0">This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each  station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, other  than paging geographic area authorizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operationally related transmitters. Each station must have at  least one transmitter. There is no limit to the number of transmitters  that a station may comprise. However, transmitters within a station  should be operationally related and/or should serve the same general  geographical area. Operationally related transmitters are those that  operate together as a system (e.g., trunked systems, simulcast systems),  rather than independently.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Split of large systems. The FCC may split wide-area systems into  two or more stations for administrative convenience. Except for  nationwide paging and other operationally related transmitters,  transmitters that are widely separated geographically are not licensed  under a single authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consolidation of separate stations. The FCC may consolidate  site-specific contiguous authorizations upon request (FCC Form 601) of  the licensee, if appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section. Paging  licensees may include remote, stand-alone transmitters under the single  system-wide authorization, if the remote, stand-alone transmitter is  linked to the system via a control/repeater facility or by satellite.  Including a remote, stand-alone transmitter in a system-wide  authorization does not alter the limitations provided under Sec.  22.503(f) on entities other than the paging geographic area licensee. In  the alternative, paging licensees may maintain separate site-specific  authorizations for stand-alone or remote transmitters. The earliest  expiration date of the authorizations that make up the single system- wide authorization will determine the expiration date for the system- wide authorization. Licensees must file timely renewal applications for  site-specific authorizations included in a single system-wide  authorization request until the request is approved. Renewal of the  system-wide authorization will be subject to Sec. 1.949 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Replacement of site-by-site authorizations with single  authorization. After a paging geographic area authorization for a  channel has been issued, the FCC may, on its own motion, replace the  authorization(s) of any other licensee (for facilities located within  that paging geographic area on that channel) with a single replacement  authorization.
