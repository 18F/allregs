                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An AP is required for all acquisitions, to be placed by an HHS contracting office, expected to exceed $500,000 (inclusive of options) with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Letter contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unsolicited proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regulated utility services available from only one source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Proposals under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and

The request must include, as applicable: a SOW/PWS (including deliverables and reporting requirements); a certified funding document; source selection strategy and criteria; necessary clearances, approvals, and justifications (e.g., a JOFOC); a milestone schedule; and an independent Government cost estimate.) In addition, OPDIVs shall use the content requirements of the AP as a reference in determining what other information and documentation is necessary to support the intended acquisition. Alternatively, OPDIVs may prescribe use of an AP for acquisitions excepted under 307.7101(a)(1) through (a)(8).
