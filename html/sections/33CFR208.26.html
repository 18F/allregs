                                Sec. 208.26  Altus Dam and Reservoir, North Fork Red River, Okla.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Bureau of Reclamation, or its designated agent, shall operate  the Altus Dam and Reservoir in the interest of flood control as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flood control storage in the reservoir between elevation 1559  (top of conservation pool) and elevation 1562 (top of flood control  pool) amounts to 21,448 acre-feet (based on 1953 sedimentation survey).  Whenever the reservoir level is within this elevation range, the flood  control discharge facilities shall be operated under the direction of  the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in  charge of the locality, so as to reduce as much as practicable the flood  damage below the dam, and to limit the reservoir level to elevation 1562  when possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the reservoir level is below elevation 1559 and the  predicted volume of runoff from the area above the dam exceeds the  volume of water necessary to raise the reservoir level above elevation  1559, the reservoir will be operated to obtain maximum overall benefits  which may consist of preflood releases: Provided, That all preflood  releases will have prior concurrence of the Bureau of Reclamation or its  designated agent. The preflood releases shall not result in a reservoir  level below elevation 1559 at the end of the flood.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the reservoir level exceeds elevation 1559, releases will  be made equal to inflow or 2,000 c.f.s., whichever is smaller, except  that when the reservoir elevation forecast indicates that this operation  will result in a reservoir level exceeding elevation 1562, releases will  be increased in order to provide maximum overall benefits and prevent  the reservoir level from exceeding elevation 1562, insofar as possible.  The flood control pool will be emptied by continuing the peak discharge  rate until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559, at which time  releases will be made equal to inflow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the reservoir level exceeds elevation 1562 (top of flood  control pool) releases shall be made at the maximum rate possible  through the spillway gates, conduit, and the uncontrolled spillway and  continued until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559, at which  time releases will be made equal to inflow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whenever the reservoir level is above elevation 1559 and  communication with the Bureau of Reclamation Regional Office and the  Corps of Engineers District Office is unobtainable, releases shall be  made equal to inflow until all gates are fully open. The maximum release  thus obtained shall be maintained until the pool recedes to elevation  1559 at which time releases shall be made to equal inflow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The representative of the Bureau of Reclamation, or its  designated agent, in immediate charge of the operation of Altus Dam will  furnish daily to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department  of the Army, in charge of the locality, a report on forms provided by  the District for this purpose, showing the reservoir pool elevation; the  number of spillway gates in operation with their respective opening and  releases; the uncontrolled spillway release; conduit, canal outlet  wasteway, and irrigation releases; storage; reservoir inflow; available  evaporation data; and precipitation in inches. A reading at 8 a.m.,  noon, 4 p.m., and midnight, shall be shown for each day. Whenever the  reservoir level rises to elevation 1559 and releases for flood control  regulation are necessary or appear imminent, the representative of the  Bureau of Reclamation or its designated agent, shall report at once to  the District Engineer by telephone or telegraph and, unless otherwise  instructed, shall report at 8 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. thereafter, in that  manner, until the reservoir level recedes to elevation 1559. These  latter reports shall reach the District Engineer by 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and  4 p.m. each day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The regulations of this section, insofar as they govern use of  the flood control storage capacity above elevation 1559 are subject to  temporary modification by the District Engineer in time of flood, if  found desirable on the basis of conditions at the time. Such desired  modifications shall be coordinated with and approved by the Bureau of  Reclamation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Flood control operation shall not restrict releases necessary  for irrigation, municipal, and industrial uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Releases made in accordance with the regulations of this section  are subject to the conditions that releases shall not be made at rates  or in a manner that would be inconsistent with emergency requirements  for protecting the dam and reservoir from major damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Any time that the Bureau of Reclamation determines that  operation in accordance with the regulations of this section will  jeopardize the safety of Altus Dam, they will so advise the District  Engineer and will assume operational responsibility and take action  necessary to assure the safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The discharge characteristics of the controlled and the  uncontrolled spillways (capable of discharging approximately 42,800  c.f.s. and 2,000 c.f.s., respectively, with the reservoir level at  elevation 1562) shall be maintained in accordance with the construction  plans (Bureau of Reclamation Drawing No. 258-D-69).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> All elevations stated in this section are at Altus Dam and are  referred to the datum in use at that location.
