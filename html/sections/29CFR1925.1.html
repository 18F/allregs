                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 1034, 41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.) requires that every contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of $2,500 (except as provided in section 7 of the Act), the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees, must contain, among other provisions, a stipulation that ``no part of the services covered by this Act will be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions, provided by or under the control or supervision of the contractor or any subcontractor, which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish the services.'' This part 1925 expresses certain minimum safety and health standards which will be applied in the administration and enforcement of the Act to determine whether services covered by the Act are being, or have been, performed in compliance with its safety and health requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Investigators conducting investigations and all officers of the Department of Labor evaluating, reviewing and analyzing investigations, as well as officers of the Department determining whether there are or have been violations of the safety and health requirements of the Service Contract Act of 1965 or any contract subject thereto and the terms on which there may be a settlement of issues arising from an investigation without resort to administrative or judicial litigation, will consider a failure to comply with the safety and health measures provided in Sec. 1925.2 to result in working conditions which are ``unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act and the contract stipulation it requires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Investigators conducting investigations and all officers of the Department of Labor evaluating, reviewing and analyzing investigations, as well as officers of the Department determining whether there are or have been violations of the safety and health requirements of the Service Contract Act of 1965 or any contract subject thereto and the terms on which there may be a settlement of issues arising from an investigation without resort to administrative or judicial litigation, will consider a failure to comply with the safety and health measures provided in Sec. 1925.2 to result in working conditions which are ``unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act and the contract stipulation it requires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The standards expressed in this part 1925 are for application to ordinary employment situations, and do not preclude proof or recognition of the necessity for additional standards in employment situations of extraordinary hazard. Neither do the standards expressed in this Part 1925 purport to cover all of the working conditions which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees. Other working conditions may be found to be unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of such employees on evidence to that effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance with the standards expressed in this part 1925 will not relieve anyone from any obligation he may have to comply with any stricter standard, such as state or local law or

ordinance or collective bargaining agreement.
