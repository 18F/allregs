                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The licensee of a UHF television broadcast translator station may be authorized to operate one or more signal boosters for the purpose of providing reception to small shadowed areas within the area intended to be served by the translator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transmitting apparatus shall consist of a simple linear radio frequency amplifier, with one or more amplifying stages, which is capable of receiving, amplifying, and retransmitting the signals of the parent translator without significantly altering any electrical characteristic of the received signal other than its amplitude. The maximum power input to the plate of the final radio frequency amplifier shall not exceed 5 watts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amplifier shall be equipped with suitable circuits which will automatically cause it to cease radiating if no signal is being received from the parent translator station. Care shall be taken in the design of the apparatus to insure that out-of-band radiation is not excessive and that adequate isolation is maintained between the input and output circuits to prevent unstable operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The installation of the apparatus and its associated receiving and transmitting antennas shall be in accordance with accepted principles of good engineering practice. Either horizontal, vertical, or circular polarization of the electric field of the radiated signal may be employed. If the isolation between the input and output circuits depends in part upon the polarization or directive properties of the transmitting and receiving antennas, the installation shall be sufficiently rugged to withstand the normal hazards of the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The operation of a UHF translator signal booster is subject to the condition that no harmful interference is caused to the reception of any station, broadcast or non-broadcast, other than the parent translator. The licensee of the UHF translator signal booster is expected to use reasonable diligence to minimize interference to the direct reception of the parent translator station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> UHF translator signal boosters may be operated unattended. Repairs and adjustments shall be made by a qualified person. The required qualifications are set forth in Sec.  74.750 (g) and (h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An individual call sign will not be assigned to a UHF translator booster station. The retransmission of the call sign of the parent translator will serve as station identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applications for authority to construct and operate a UHF translator signal booster shall be submitted on FCC Form 346A. No construction of facilities or installation of apparatus at the proposed transmitter site shall be made until a construction permit therefor has been issued by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of Sec.  74.765 concerning posting of station license shall apply to a UHF translator signal booster except that the parent UHF translator call sign, followed by the word ``Booster'', shall be displayed at the signal booster site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The provisions of Sec. Sec.  74.767 and 74.781 concerning marking and lighting of antenna structures and station records, respectively, apply to UHF translator signal boosters.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Effective July 11, 1975, no new UHF signal boosters will be authorized. Licensees of such existing boosters may make application for renewal of license or change in facilities on the applicable FCC forms for Television Broadcast Translator Stations (Form 346, for construction permits; 347, for license to cover construction permit; and 303-S, for renewal of license). Report and Order, Docket No. 20372. May 28, 1975.
