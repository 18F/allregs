For rules concerning the payment of any tax or the filing of any return required under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 4181 and 4182 relating to firearms and ammunition or subtitle E relating to alcohol, tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, see 26 U.S.C. 5061, 5703, and 6302 and the regulations covering the specific commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Legal holidays.
