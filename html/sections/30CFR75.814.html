The thermal protection must operate at either 50 percent of the maximum temperature rise of the grounding resistor, or 150 [deg]C (302 [deg]F), whichever is less, and must open the ground-wire monitor circuit for the high-voltage circuit supplying the section power center. The thermal protection must not be dependent upon control power and may consist of a current transformer and overcurrent relay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> High-voltage motor and shearer circuits must be provided with instantaneous ground-fault protection set at not more than 0.125-ampere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Time-delay settings of ground-fault protective devices used to provide coordination with the instantaneous ground-fault protection of motor and shearer circuits must not exceed 0.25-second.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Undervoltage protection must be provided by a device which operates on loss of voltage to cause and maintain the interruption of power to a circuit to prevent automatic restarting of the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Current transformers used for the ground-fault protection specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (5) of this section must be single window-type and must be installed to encircle all three phase conductors.
