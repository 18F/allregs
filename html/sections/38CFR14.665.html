                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The claim must be presented in writing on VA Form 2-4760,  Employee's Claim for Reimbursement for Personal Property Damaged or Lost  Incident to Employment. It will be submitted to the personnel office  where the claim originates within 2 years after it accrues except that  if the claim accrues in time of war or in time of armed conflict in  which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged or if such war or  armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good  cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after  that cause ceases to exist. The claim must be executed and certified by  the officer or the employee suffering the loss or damage, or in the  event of his or her death, by the surviving spouse, children, father or  mother or both, or brothers or sisters or both. Claims of survivors  shall be settled and paid in the order named. All claims must contain  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date, time, and place the loss or damage occurred and the  circumstances surrounding such loss or damage, together with the  supporting statements of any witnesses who can verify such facts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event of damage, the date of acquisition, original cost,  condition before damage, and at least two estimates of the cost of  repair or replacement. In the event of loss, the date of acquisition,  the original cost, the condition, and an estimate of the reasonable  market value of the article or articles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement as to any claims or potential claim he or she may  have for indemnification of the loss or damage against other than the  United States and whether he or she will assign such to the United  States and cooperate in its prosecution. Where such claim or potential  claim is against a carrier or insurer, evidence that a timely claim has  been properly made. Where a recovery from the carrier or his or her  insurer has been obtained or offered, such information shall be  included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In cases involving damage or destruction of personal property by  patients or domiciliary members, a statement as to whether a claim was  filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 703(a)(5) and whether such claim has been  finally denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Personnel Officer receiving the claim will forward same to  the person designated to investigate accidents at the station pursuant  to Sec.  14.605 within 5 days after receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The employee designated pursuant to Sec.  14.605 will ascertain  if such claim is complete in all respects and conduct such investigation  as is necessary to establish all facts required to properly evaluate the  claim both as to merit and the reasonable amount payable for the loss or  damage. Where it is indicated that the claimant may have a potential  claim against other than the United States, the employee designated will  secure a suitable assignment of all right and title to such claim, to  the extent the United States makes reimbursement, and the agreement of  the claimant to furnish such evidence as may be necessary to pursue such  claim. If the potential claim is against a carrier or insurer, the  employee designated will ascertain that the claimant has filed a timely  proper claim and procure evidence thereof. The employee designated will  also include information concerning any offer of settlement the carrier  may have made. The completed investigation, original claim and  supporting evidence will be forwarded to the appropriate Regional  Counsel.  [38 FR 5475, Mar. 1, 1973, as amended at 42 FR 41421, Aug. 17, 1977]</p>
