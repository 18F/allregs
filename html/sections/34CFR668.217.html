Consider your history, resources, dollars in default, and targets for default reduction to determine which activities will result in the most benefit to you and your students.</p><p class="depth3">3. Define evaluation methods and establish a data collection system for measuring and verifying relevant default prevention statistics, including a statistical analysis of the borrowers who default on their loans.</p><p class="depth3">4.

Track the borrower's delinquency status by obtaining reports from data managers and FFEL Program lenders.</p><p class="depth3">5. Enhance student loan repayments through counseling the borrower on loan repayment options and facilitating contact between the borrower and the data manager or FFEL Program lender.</p><p class="depth3">6. Assist a borrower who is experiencing difficulty in finding employment through career counseling, job placement assistance, and facilitating unemployment deferments.</p><p class="depth3">7. Identify and implement alternative financial aid award policies and develop alternative financial resources that will reduce the need for student borrowing in the first 2 years of academic study.</p><p class="depth3">III. Statistics for Measuring Progress</p><p class="depth3">1. The number of students enrolled at your institution during each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">2. The average amount borrowed by a student each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">3. The number of borrowers scheduled to enter repayment each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">4. The number of enrolled borrowers who received default prevention counseling services each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">5.

The number of borrowers at least 60 days delinquent each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">7. The number of borrowers who defaulted in each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">8.
