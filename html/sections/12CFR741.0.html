This part prescribes various requirements for  obtaining and maintaining federal insurance and the payment of insurance  premiums and capitalization deposit. Subpart A of this part contains  substantive requirements that are not codified elsewhere in this  chapter. Subpart B of this part lists additional regulations, set forth  elsewhere in this chapter as applying to federal credit unions, that  also apply to federally insured state-chartered credit unions. As used  in this part, ``insured credit union'' means a credit union whose  accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund  (NCUSIF).</p>
