                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis consist of the part of the  torso assembly shown by number SA 103C 030 on drawing SA 103C 001 and  conform to each of the applicable drawings listed under this number on  drawing SA 103C 002, sheets 10 and 11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall flex by  an amount that permits the rigid thoracic spine to rotate from its  initial position in accordance with Figure 18 of this subpart by 40  degrees at a force level of not less than 34 pounds and not more than 47  pounds, and straighten upon removal of the force to within 5 degrees of  its initial position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dummy with lower legs removed is  positioned in an upright seated position on a seat as indicated in  Figure 18, ensuring that all dummy component surfaces are clean, dry and  untreated unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attach the pelvis to the seating surface by a bolt C/328,  modified as shown in Figure 18, and the upper legs at the knee axial  rotation joints by the attachments shown in Figure 18. Tighten the  mountings so that the pelvis-lumbar joining surface is horizontal and  adjust the femur ball-flange screws at each hip socket joint to 50 inch  pounds torque. Remove the head and   the neck and install a cylindrical aluminum adapter 2.0 inches in  diameter and 2.80 inches long in place of the neck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flex the thorax forward 50 degrees and then rearward as  necessary to return to its initial position in accordance with Figure 18  unsupported by external means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Apply a forward pull force in the midsagittal plane at the top  of the neck adapter, so that at 40 degrees of the lumbar spine flexion  the applied force is perpendicular to the thoracic spine box. Apply the  force at any torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per  second up to 40 degrees of flexion but no further; continue to apply for  10 seconds the force necessary to maintain 40 degrees of flexion, and  record the highest applied force at that time. Release all force as  rapidly as possible and measure the return angle 3 minutes after the  release.</p>
