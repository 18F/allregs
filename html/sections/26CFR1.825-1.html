                                Sec. 1.825-1  Unused loss deduction; in general.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> shall be an amount equal to the sum of the unused loss  carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year. The amount so determined  is used in the computation of mutual insurance company taxable income  for the taxable year. See section 821(b) and Sec. 1.821-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> defines the term ``unused  loss'' as the amount (if any) by which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sum of the statutory underwriting loss (as defined in  section   823(a)(2)) and the investment loss (as defined in section 822(a)(2))  exceeds</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxable investment income (as defined in section 822(a)(1)),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The statutory underwriting income (as defined in section  823(a)(1)), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amounts required to be subtracted from the protection  against loss account under section 824(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Steps in computation of unused loss deduction. The three steps  to be taken in the ascertainment of the unused loss deduction for any  taxable year are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compute the unused loss for any preceding or succeeding taxable  year from which an unused loss may be carried over or carried back to  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compute the unused loss carryovers to the taxable year from such  preceding taxable years and the unused loss carrybacks to the taxable  year from such succeeding taxable years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add such unused loss carryovers and carrybacks in order to  determine the unused loss deduction for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statement with tax return. Every mutual insurance company  taxable under section 821(a) claiming an unused loss deduction for any  taxable year shall file with its return for such year a concise  statement setting forth the amount of the unused loss deduction claimed  and all material and pertinent facts relative thereto, including a  detailed schedule showing the computation of the unused loss deduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ascertainment of deduction dependent upon unused loss carryback.  If a mutual insurance company taxable under section 821(a) is entitled  in computing its unused loss deduction to a carryback which it is not  able to ascertain at the time its return is due, it shall compute the  unused loss deduction on its return without regard to such unused loss  carryback. When the company ascertains the unused loss carryback, it may  within the applicable period of limitations file a claim for credit or  refund of the overpayment, if any, resulting from the failure to compute  the unused loss deduction for the taxable year with the inclusion of  such carryback; or it may file an application under the provisions of  section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Law applicable to computations. The following rules shall apply  to taxable years for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax imposed by  section 821(a):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining the amount of any unused loss carryback or  carryover to any taxable year, the necessary computations involving any  other taxable year shall be made under the law applicable to such other  taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The unused loss for any taxable year shall be determined under  the law applicable to that year without regard to the year to which it  is to be carried and in which, in effect, it is to be deducted as part  of the unused loss deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the unused loss deduction which shall be allowed  for any taxable year shall be determined under the law applicable for  that year.
