                                Sec. 17.5  Criteria for emergency filing for public inspection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An agency may request emergency filing for public inspection for documents to be published under the regular, emergency or deferred publication schedules. Emergency filing for public inspection provides for the fastest possible public access to a document after it has been received, processed and assigned a publication date. Emergency filing for public inspection is considered a special arrangement under Sec. 17.2 of this part that results in deviation from the regular schedule for filing for public inspection. A document receiving emergency filing for public inspection remains on public inspection until it is published according to the schedule for publication.
