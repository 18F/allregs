                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part. This section describes how and when these interim provisions apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Small-volume engine manufacturers. Special provisions apply to you for sterndrive/inboard engines if you are a small-volume engine manufacturer subject to the requirements of this part. You may delay complying with emission standards and other requirements that would otherwise apply until the 2011 model year for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines and until the 2013 model year for high-performance engines. For an engine to be exempt under this paragraph (a), you must contact us before January 1, 2011 or before you introduce such engines into U.S. commerce, whichever comes first. Add a permanent label to a readily visible part of each engine exempted under this paragraph (a). This label must include at least the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engine displacement (in liters), rated power, and model year of the engine or whom to contact for further information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following statement: ``THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1045.145(a) FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Early banking. You may generate exhaust emission credits for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines before the 2010 model year (or before the 2011 model year for small-volume engine manufacturers) as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must begin actual production of early-compliant engines by September 1, 2009 (or before September 1, 2010 for small-volume engine manufacturers).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may not generate emission credits under this paragraph (b) with engines you produce after December 31, 2009 (or December 31, 2010 for small-volume engine manufacturers).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Early-compliant engines must be certified to the standards and requirements for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines under this part 1045, with all family emission limits at or below the specified emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculate emission credits by setting STD equal to 16 g/kW-hr for HC+NOX and 150 g/kW-hr for CO (see Sec.  1045.705).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Small-volume engine manufacturers may calculate emission credits using a multiplier based on the number of model years before the 2011 model year. The multipliers are 1.25 for one year early, 1.5 for two years early, and 2.0 for three years early. For example, multiply your calculated emission credits generated from compliant 2009 model year engines by 1.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You may not use the provisions of this paragraph (b) to generate emission credits for engines whose point of first retail sale is in California.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> HC+NOX or CO credits you generate under this paragraph (b) may not be used after the 2012 model year (or the 2013 model year for small-volume engine manufacturers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assigned emission factors. Through the 2013 model year, small-volume engine manufacturers may establish emission levels for certification without testing for conventional four-stroke sterndrive/inboard engines by selecting a family emission limit of 22.0 g/kW-hr for HC+NOX emissions and 150 g/kW-hr for CO emissions. Note that you must use emission credits under the provisions of subpart H of this part to show that you meet applicable requirements if you use these family emission limits. Also, if you use these family emission limits, you must use them for both HC+NOX and CO emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Early compliance with evaporative emission standards. You may sell or install fuel tanks that do not meet the specified permeation standards without violating the prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) if you earn evaporative emission allowances, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may earn an evaporative emission allowance from one fuel tank certified to EPA's evaporative emission standards by producing it before EPA's evaporative emission standards start to apply. You may use this evaporative emission allowance by selling one fuel tank that does not meet the specified permeation emission standards. For example, you can earn an evaporative emission allowance by selling a low-permeation fuel tank for personal watercraft before the 2011 model year, in which case you could sell a high-permeation fuel tank for a personal watercraft in 2011. You must meet all the other requirements related to evaporative emissions that apply for fuel tanks covered by an EPA certificate of conformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must add a label to exempted fuel tanks you produce under this paragraph (d) with the following statement: ``EXEMPT FROM EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1045.145(d)''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evaporative emission allowances you earn under this paragraph (d) from portable marine fuel tanks may be used only for other portable marine fuel tanks. Similarly, evaporative emission allowances from personal watercraft fuel tanks may be used only for personal watercraft fuel tanks and evaporative emission allowances from other installed fuel tanks may be used only for other installed fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may not use the allowances you generate under this paragraph (d) for portable marine fuel tanks and personal watercraft fuel tanks in 2014 or later model years. Similarly, you may not use the allowances you generate under this paragraph (d) for other installed fuel tanks in 2015 or later model years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer the following information for each year in which you use the provisions of this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Send us a report within 45 days after the end of the model year describing how many pieces of equipment you produced in the preceding model year that generate allowances. You may combine this with the reports specified in Sec.  1045.250(a) if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe the number of equipment using allowances under this paragraph (d) in your end-of-year reports and final reports after the end of the model year as described in Sec.  1045.730(a). If you do not participate in averaging, banking, and trading program, send this information separately within 90 days after the end of the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Useful life for evaporative emission standards. A useful life period of two years applies for fuel tanks certified to meet the permeation emission standards in Sec.  1045.112(b) in 2013 and earlier model years. However, for fuel tanks with a family emission limit above or below the specified emission standard, calculate emission credits under Sec.  1045.706 based on the useful life values specified in Sec.  1045.112.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Delayed FEL caps for stand-up personal watercraft. The FEL caps specified in Sec.  1045.103(b) do not apply in the 2010 and 2011 model years for personal watercraft that are designed for operation from a standing position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Delayed compliance with not-to-exceed emission standards. The not-to-exceed standards specified in Sec.  1045.107 do not apply in the 2010 through 2012 model years for engine families that are certified based on carryover emission data from the 2009 model year. This includes models that were certified only in California, as long as no new testing is otherwise required to get a new certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Carryover of California ARB emission data. The provisions of 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(5) allow for the use of emission data generated for the California Air Resources Board as the basis for EPA certification. For sterndrive/inboard engines certified in California before the 2010 model year, you may use such emission data as the basis for meeting the standards of Sec.  1045.105, as long as you meet the conditions specified in Sec.  1045.235(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hardship for obsolete engines. We have made the determination under 40 CFR 1068.255 that secondary engine manufacturers may use the hardship exemption to sell uncertified 4.3-liter

and 8.1-liter engines from General Motors in the 2010 model year. These engines are exempt without request. You must label the engines as specified in 40 CFR 1068.255(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Adjusted NTE subzones for noncatalyzed four-stroke engines. For supercharged four-stroke outboard engines above 150 kW without catalysts, you may divide the NTE zone specified in Sec.  1045.515(c)(6) based on a speed cutpoint of 70 percent of maximum test speed instead of 50 percent of maximum test speed through the 2014 model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Averaging for under-cowl fuel lines. Section 1045.112 specifies phased-in standards for under-cowl fuel lines for 2010 through 2014 model years, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must comply with these requirements based on total lengths of compliant and noncompliant fuel lines. For each model year, calculate the percentage of compliant under-cowl fuel line by adding up the length of under-cowl fuel line certified to meet the applicable permeation standards and dividing this sum by the total length of under-cowl fuel line from all your outboard engines. You may count a fuel line as compliant only if you certify that its emission levels will be at or below the specified standard throughout the useful life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In your application for certification for each outboard engine family, identify the part numbers, descriptions, and locations of all the compliant fuel lines. You must include a drawing of any fuel lines in addition to the description if that is necessary for us to find which fuel lines you intend to be certified. Your descriptions must include the lengths of compliant and noncompliant fuel lines for each engine, including aggregated lengths for the whole set of fuel lines used on an engine. If the engine family includes noncompliant fuel lines, you must also include a statement that you will have enough compliant fuel lines to meet the phase-in requirements and provide detailed calculations to support your statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer end-of-year reports and final reports after the end of each model year that you use noncompliant fuel lines as described in Sec.  1045.730(a). Include the production volumes with a point of retail sale in the United States, as described in Sec. Sec.  1045.701(j). State your production volumes in terms of total engine sales by model and in terms of total lengths of compliant and noncompliant fuel lines. If a single engine family includes configurations with different lengths of compliant or noncompliant fuel lines, count each configuration separately. If you changed your designs during the model year in a way that affects these compliance calculations, identify the actual production volumes associated with each unique design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Keep a copy of the reports we require in this paragraph (k) until December 31, 2022 as described in Sec.  1045.735(b). We may require you to keep additional records or to send us relevant information not required by this paragraph (k), as allowed under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Label your compliant low-permeation fuel lines as specified in Sec.  1060.137. Any fuel line observed without a complete identification as specified in Sec.  1060.137 will be considered noncompliant. In addition, for each model year in which you use noncompliant fuel lines, you must include one of the following statements on the engine label described in Sec.  1045.135:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``LOW-PERM/HIGH-PERM = [x/y]'', where x is the percentage of low-permeation under-cowl fuel line and y is the percentage of high-permeation under-cowl fuel line (x and y must sum to 100).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``LOW-PERM = [x mm]; HIGH-PERM = [y mm]'', where x is the length of low-permeation under-cowl fuel line and y is the length of high-permeation under-cowl fuel line, in mm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Delayed labeling for fuel lines. You may omit fuel-line labeling requirements specified in 40 CFR part 1060 in the 2009 model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Continued use of 40 CFR part 91 test procedures. You may continue to use the test procedures in 40 CFR part 91 instead of those in subpart F of this part for 2010 through 2012 model year outboard and personal watercraft engines. This applies for certification, production-line, and in-use testing. You may continue to use test data

based on the test procedures in 40 CFR part 91 for engine families in 2013 and later model years, provided that we allow you to use carryover emission data under 40 CFR 1045.235(d) for your engine family. You may also use the test procedures in 40 CFR part 91 for production-line testing with any engine family whose certification is based on testing with those procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Banking early credits for jet boat engines. Banked emission credits that were originally generated from outboard and personal watercraft engines under 40 CFR part 91 may be used to certify jet boat engines under the provisions Sec.  1045.660.
