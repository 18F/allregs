                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vehicles comprising the sample which are required to be tested  under a test request in accordance with this subpart must be selected  consecutively as they are produced. Before the official test, the test  vehicle must not be prepared, tested, modified, adjusted, or maintained  in any manner unless such preparation, tests, modifications, adjustments  or maintenance are part of the manufacturer's prescribed manufacturing  and inspection procedures, and are documented in the manufacturer's  internal vehicle assembly and inspection procedures, are required or  permitted under this subpart, or are approved in advance by the  Administrator. For purposes of this section, prescribed manufacturing  and inspection procedures include quality control testing and assembly  procedures normally performed by the manufacturer   on like products during early production if the resulting testing is not  biased by this procedure. In the case of imported products, the  manufacturer may perform adjustments, preparations, modification or  tests normally performed at the port of entry by the manufacturer to  prepare the vehicle for delivery to a dealer or customer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equipment or fixtures necessary to conduct the test may be  installed on the vehicle if such equipment or fixtures have no effect on  the noise emissions of the vehicle, as determined by the measurement  methodology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a vehicle malfunction (i.e., failure to start,  etc.) the manufacturer may perform the maintenance that is necessary to  enable the vehicle to operate in a normal manner. This maintenance must  be documented and reported in the SEA report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No quality control, quality assurance testing, assembly or  selection procedures may be used on the test vehicle or any portion of  the test vehicle including parts and subassemblies, unless such quality  control, quality assurance testing, assembly or selection procedures are  used normally during the production and assembly of all other vehicles  of this configuration which will be distributed in commerce, are  required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a vehicle is unable to complete the noise tests, the  manufacturer may replace the vehicle. Any replacement vehicle must be a  production vehicle of the same configuration as the replaced vehicle or  a noisier configuration and will be subject to all the provisions of  these regulations. Any replacement must be reported in the SEA report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is 10 percent. The  appropriate sampling plans associated with the designated AQL are  contained in Appendix II or the test request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The vehicles of the category, configuration or configuration  subgroup selected for testing must be assembled by the manufacturer for  distribution in commerce using the manufacturer's normal production  process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer  must initiate testing with the vehicles of the category, configuration  or configuration subgroup specified in the test request which are next  scheduled for production after receipt of the test request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The manufacturer must keep on hand all products in the test  sample until the sample is accepted or rejected in accordance with Sec.  205.160-6; except that vehicles actually tested and found to be in  conformance with this regulation need not be kept.  [45 FR 86708, Dec. 31, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 57721, Dec. 28, 1982]    Sec. 205.160-3  [Reserved]</p>
