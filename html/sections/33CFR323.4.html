                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section, any discharge of dredged or fill material that may result from  any of the following activities is not prohibited by or otherwise  subject to regulation under section 404:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Normal farming, silviculture and ranching activities such as  plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, and harvesting for the  production of food, fiber, and forest products, or upland soil and water  conservation practices, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To fall under this exemption, the activities specified in  paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be part of an established  (i.e., on-going) farming, silviculture, or ranching operation and must  be in accordance with definitions in Sec. 323.4(a)(1)(iii). Activities  on areas lying fallow as part of a conventional rotational cycle are  part of an established operation. Activities which bring an area into  farming, silviculture, or ranching use are not part of an established  operation. An operation ceases to be established when the area on which  it was conducted has been coverted to another use or has lain idle so  long that modifications to the hydrological regime are necessary to  resume operations. If an activity takes place outside the waters of the  United States, or if it does not involve a discharge, it does not need a  section 404 permit, whether or not it is part of an established farming,  silviculture, or ranching operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cultivating means physical methods of soil treatment  employed within established farming, ranching and silviculture lands on  farm, ranch, or forest crops to aid and improve their growth, quality or  yield.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Harvesting means physical measures employed directly upon farm,  forest, or ranch crops within established agricultural and silvicultural  lands to bring about their removal from farm, forest, or ranch land, but  does not include the construction of farm, forest, or ranch roads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> Minor drainage means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The discharge of dredged or fill material incidental to  connecting upland drainage facilities to waters of the United States,  adequate to effect the removal of excess soil moisture from upland  croplands. (Construction and maintenance of upland (dryland) facilities,  such as ditching and tiling, incidential to the planting, cultivating,  protecting, or harvesting of crops, involve no discharge of dredged or  fill material into waters of the United States, and as such never  require a section 404 permit.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The discharge of dredged or fill material for the purpose of  installing ditching or other such water control facilities incidental to  planting, cultivating, protecting, or harvesting of rice, cranberries or  other wetland crop species, where these activities and the discharge  occur in waters of the United States which are in established use for  such agricultural and silvicultural wetland crop production;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this  section apply to areas that are in established use exclusively for  wetland crop production as well as areas in established use for  conventional wetland/non-wetland crop rotation (e.g., the rotations of  rice and soybeans) where such rotation results in the cyclical or  intermittent temporary dewatering of such areas.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The discharges of dredged or fill material incidental to the  emergency removal of sandbars, gravel bars, or other similar blockages  which are formed during flood flows or other events, where such  blockages close or constrict previously existing drainageways and, if  not promptly removed, would result in damage to or loss of existing  crops or would impair or prevent the plowing, seeding, harvesting or  cultivating of crops on land in established use for crop production.  Such removal does not include enlarging or extending the dimensions of,  or changing the bottom elevations of, the affected drainageway as it  existed prior to the formation of the blockage. Removal must be  accomplished within one year of discovery of such blockages in order to  be eligible for exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minor drainage in waters of the U.S. is limited to drainage  within areas that are part of an established farming or silviculture  operation. It does not include drainage associated with the immediate or  gradual conversion of a wetland to a non-wetland (e.g., wetland species  to upland species not typically adapted to life in saturated soil  conditions), or conversion from one wetland use to another (for example,  silviculture to farming). In addition, minor drainage does not include  the construction of any canal, ditch, dike or other waterway or  structure which drains or otherwise significantly modifies a stream,  lake, swamp, bog or any other wetland or aquatic area constituting  waters of the United States. Any discharge of dredged or fill material  into the waters of the United States incidental to the construction of  any such structure or waterway requires a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Plowing means all forms of primary tillage, including moldboard,  chisel, or wide-blade plowing, discing, harrowing and similar physical  means utilized on farm, forest or ranch land for the breaking up,  cutting, turning over, or stirring of soil to prepare it for the  planting of crops. The term does not include the redistribution of soil,  rock, sand, or other surficial materials in a manner which changes any  area of the waters of the United States to dry land. For example, the  redistribution of surface materials by blading, grading, or other means  to fill in wetland areas is not plowing. Rock crushing activities which  result in the loss of natural drainage characteristics, the reduction of  water storage and recharge capabilities, or the overburden of natural  water filtration capacities do not constitute plowing. Plowing as  described above will never involve a discharge of dredged or fill  material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Seeding means the sowing of seed and placement of seedlings to  produce farm, ranch, or forest crops and includes the placement of soil  beds for seeds or seedlings on established farm and forest lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance, including emergency reconstruction of recently  damaged parts, of currently serviceable structures such as dikes, dams,  levees, groins, riprap, breakwaters, causeways, bridge abutments or  approaches, and transportation structures. Maintenance does not include  any modification that changes the character, scope, or size of the  original fill design. Emergency reconstruction must occur within a  reasonable period of time after damage occurs in order to qualify for  this exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation  ditches, or the maintenance (but not construction) of drainage ditches.  Discharges associated with siphons, pumps, headgates, wingwalls, weirs,  diversion structures, and such other facilities as are appurtenant and  functionally related to irrigation ditches are included in this  exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction  site which does not include placement of fill material into waters of  the U.S. The term ``construction site'' refers to   any site involving the erection of buildings, roads, and other discrete  structures and the installation of support facilities necessary for  construction and utilization of such structures. The term also includes  any other land areas which involve land-disturbing excavation  activities, including quarrying or other mining activities, where an  increase in the runoff of sediment is controlled through the use of  temporary sedimentation basins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any activity with respect to which a State has an approved  program under section 208(b)(4) of the CWA which meets the requirements  of sections 208(b)(4) (B) and (C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Construction or maintenance of farm roads, forest roads, or  temporary roads for moving mining equipment, where such roads are  constructed and maintained in accordance with best management practices  (BMPs) to assure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and  biological characteristics of waters of the United States are not  impaired, that the reach of the waters of the United States is not  reduced, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be  otherwise minimized. These BMPs which must be applied to satisfy this  provision shall include those detailed BMPs described in the State's  approved program description pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR  233.22(i), and shall also include the following baseline provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permanent roads (for farming or forestry activities), temporary  access roads (for mining, forestry, or farm purposes) and skid trails  (for logging) in waters of the U.S. shall be held to the minimum  feasible number, width, and total length consistent with the purpose of  specific farming, silvicultural or mining operations, and local  topographic and climatic conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All roads, temporary or permanent, shall be located  sufficiently far from streams or other water bodies (except for portions  of such roads which must cross water bodies) to minimize discharges of  dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The road fill shall be bridged, culverted, or otherwise  designed to prevent the restriction of expected flood flows;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The fill shall be properly stabilized and maintained during and  following construction to prevent erosion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United  States to construct a road fill shall be made in a manner that minimizes  the encroachment of trucks, tractors, bulldozers, or other heavy  equipment within waters of the United States (including adjacent  wetlands) that lie outside the lateral boundaries of the fill itself;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In designing, constructing, and maintaining roads, vegetative  disturbance in the waters of the U.S. shall be kept to a minimum;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The design, construction and maintenance of the road crossing  shall not disrupt the migration or other movement of those species of  aquatic life inhabiting the water body;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Borrow material shall be taken from upland sources whenever  feasible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The discharge shall not take, or jeopardize the continued  existence of, a threatened or endangered species as defined under the  Endangered Species Act, or adversely modify or destroy the critical  habitat of such species;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Discharges into breeding and nesting areas for migratory  waterfowl, spawning areas, and wetlands shall be avoided if practical  alternatives exist;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> The discharge shall not be located in the proximity of a public  water supply intake;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> The discharge shall not occur in areas of concentrated  shellfish production;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> The discharge shall not occur in a component of the National  Wild and Scenic River System;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> The discharge of material shall consist of suitable material  free from toxic pollutants in toxic amounts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> All temporary fills shall be removed in their entirety and the  area restored to its original elevation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If any discharge of dredged or fill material resulting from the  activities listed in paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) of this section  contains any toxic pollutant listed under section 307 of the CWA such  discharge shall be subject to any applicable toxic effluent standard or  prohibition, and shall require a section 404 permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the  United   States incidental to any of the activities identified in paragraphs (a)  (1) through (6) of this section must have a permit if it is part of an  activity whose purpose is to convert an area of the waters of the United  States into a use to which it was not previously subject, where the flow  or circulation of waters of the United States nay be impaired or the  reach of such waters reduced. Where the proposed discharge will result  in significant discernible alterations to flow or circulation, the  presumption is that flow or circulation may be impaired by such  alteration. For example, a permit will be required for the conversion of  a cypress swamp to some other use or the conversion of a wetland from  silvicultural to agricultural use when there is a discharge of dredged  or fill material into waters of the United States in conjunction with  construction of dikes, drainage ditches or other works or structures  used to effect such conversion. A conversion of a section 404 wetland to  a non-wetland is a change in use of an area of waters of the United  States. A discharge which elevates the bottom of waters of the United  States without converting it to dry land does not thereby reduce the  reach of, but may alter the flow or circulation of, waters of the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Federal projects which qualify under the criteria contained in  section 404(r) of the CWA are exempt from section 404 permit  requirements, but may be subject to other State or Federal requirements.</p>
