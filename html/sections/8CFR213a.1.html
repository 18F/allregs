                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part, the term:</p><p class="depth0">Domicile means the place where a sponsor has his or her principal  residence, as defined in section 101(a)(33) of   the Act, with the intention to maintain that residence for the  foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth0">Federal poverty line means the level of income equal to the poverty  guidelines as issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in  accordance with 42 U.S.C. 9902 that is applicable to a household of the  size involved. For purposes of considering the Form I-864, Affidavit of  Support Under Section 213A of the Act, the Service and Consular Posts  will use the most recent income-poverty guidelines published in the  Federal Register by the Department of Health and Human Services. These  guidelines are updated annually, and the Service and Consular Posts will  begin to use updated guidelines on the first day of the second month  after the date the guidelines are published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">Household income means the income used to determine whether the  sponsor meets the minimum income requirements under sections  213A(f)(1)(E), 213A(f)(3), or 213A(f)(5) of the Act. It includes the  income of the sponsor, and of the sponsor's spouse and any other person  included in determining the sponsor's household size, if the spouse or  other person is at least 18 years old and has signed the form designated  by USCIS for this purpose, on behalf of the sponsor and intending  immigrants. The ``household income'' may not, however, include the  income of an intending immigrant, unless the intending immigrant is  either the sponsor's spouse or has the same principal residence as the  sponsor and the preponderance of the evidence shows that the intending  immigrant's income results from the intending immigrant's lawful  employment in the United States or from some other lawful source that  will continue to be available to the intending immigrant after he or she  acquires permanent resident status. The prospect of employment in the  United States that has not yet actually begun will not be sufficient to  meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Household size means the number obtained by adding the number of  persons specified in this definition. In calculating household size, no  individual shall be counted more than once. If the intending immigrant's  spouse or child is a citizen or already holds the status of an alien  lawfully admitted for permanent residence, then the sponsor should not  include that spouse or child in determining the total household size,  unless the intending immigrant's spouse or child is a dependent of the  sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> of the Act, or  spouse of the principal intending immigrant is an alien who does not  currently reside in the United States and who either is not seeking to  immigrate at the same time as, or will not seek to immigrate within six  months of the principal intending immigrant's immigration, the sponsor  may exclude that child or spouse in calculating the sponsor's household  size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> If the sponsor chooses to do so, the sponsor may add to the  number of persons specified in the first part of this definition the  number of relatives   (as defined in this section) of the sponsor who have the same principal  residence as the sponsor and whose income will be relied on to meet the  requirements of section 213A of the Act and this part.</p><p class="depth2">Immigration Officer, solely for purposes of this part, includes a  Consular Officer, as defined by section 101(a)(9) of the Act, as well as  an Immigration Officer, as defined by Sec. 103.1(j) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Income means an individual's total income (adjusted gross income for  those who file IRS Form 1040EZ) for purposes of the individual's U.S.  Federal income tax liability, including a joint income tax return (e.g.,  line 22 on the 2004 IRS Form 1040, line 15 on the 2004 IRS Form 1040A,  or line 4 on the 2004 IRS Form 1040EZ or the corresponding line on any  future revision of these IRS Forms). Only an individual's Federal income  tax return--that is, neither a state or territorial income tax return  nor an income tax return filed with a foreign government--shall be filed  with an affidavit of support, unless the individual had no duty to file  a Federal income tax return, and claims that his or her state,  territorial or foreign taxable income is sufficient to establish the  sufficiency of the affidavit of support.</p><p class="depth2">Intending immigrant means any beneficiary of an immigrant visa  petition filed under section 204 of the Act, including any alien who  will accompany or follow-to-join the principal beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2">Joint sponsor means any individual who meets the requirements of  section 213A(f)(1)(A), (B), (C), and (E) of the Act and 8 CFR  213a.2(c)(1)(i), and who, as permitted by section 213A(f)(5)(A) of the  Act, is willing to submit a an affidavit of support and accept joint and  several liability with the sponsor or substitute sponsor, in any case in  which the sponsor's or substitute sponsor's household income is not  sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 213A of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Means-tested public benefit means either a Federal means-tested  public benefit, which is any public benefit funded in whole or in part  by funds provided by the Federal Government that the Federal agency  administering the Federal funds has determined to be a Federal means- tested public benefit under the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, or a State  means-tested public benefit, which is any public benefit for which no  Federal funds are provided that a State, State agency, or political  subdivision of a State has determined to be a means-tested public  benefit. No benefit shall be considered to be a means-tested public  benefit if it is a benefit described in sections 401(b), 411(b), 422(b)  or 423(d) of Public Law 104-193.</p><p class="depth2">Program official means the officer or employee of any Federal,  State, or local government agency or of any private agency that  administers any means-tested public benefit program who has authority to  act on the agency's behalf in seeking reimbursement of means-tested  public benefits.</p><p class="depth2">Relative means a husband, wife, father, mother, child, adult son,  adult daughter, brother, or sister.</p><p class="depth2">Significant ownership interest means an ownership interest of 5  percent or more in a for-profit entity that filed an immigrant visa  petition to accord a prospective employee an immigrant status under  section 203(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsor means an individual who is either required to execute or has  executed an affidavit of support under this part.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsored immigrant means any alien who was an intending immigrant,  once that person has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, so  that the affidavit of support filed for that person under this part has  entered into force.</p><p class="depth2">Substitute sponsor means an individual who meets the requirements of  section 213A(f)(1)(A), (B), (C), and (E) of the Act and 8 CFR  213a.2(c)(1)(i), who is related to the principal intending immigrant in  one of the ways described in section 213A(f)(5)(B) of the Act, and who  is willing to sign the affidavit of support in place of the now-deceased  person who filed ta relative or fianc[eacute](e) petition that provides  the basis for the intending immigrant's ability to seek permanent  residence.
