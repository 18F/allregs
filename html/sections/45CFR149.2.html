In this part, the term  early retiree also includes the enrolled spouse, surviving spouse, and  dependents of such individuals. The determination of whether an  individual is not an active employee is made by the sponsor in  accordance with the rules of its plan.

This presumption applies whether or not the Medicare  Secondary Payer rules actually apply to the sponsor. For this purpose, a  sponsor may also treat a person receiving coverage under its employment- based plan as a dependent in accordance with the rules of its plan,  regardless of whether that individual is considered a dependent for  Federal or state tax purposes. For purposes of this definition of early  retiree, an employer maintaining, or currently contributing to, the  employment-based plan or any employer that has made substantial  contributions to fund such plan, means a plan sponsor (as defined in  this section).</p><p class="depth0">Employment-based plan means a group health plan as defined in this  section of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Good cause means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> New and material evidence exists that was not readily available  at the time the reimbursement determination was made;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A clerical error in the computation of the reimbursement  determination was made by the Secretary; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The evidence that was considered in making the reimbursement  determination clearly shows on its face that an error was made.</p><p class="depth0">Group health plan means group health plan as defined in 42 CFR  423.882 that provides health benefits to early retirees, but excludes  Federal governmental plans.</p><p class="depth0">Health benefits means medical, surgical, hospital, prescription  drug, and other benefits that may be specified by the Secretary, whether  self-funded or delivered through the purchase of health insurance or  otherwise. Such benefits include benefits for the diagnosis, cure,  mitigation, or prevention of physical or mental disease or condition  with respect to any structure or function of the body. Health benefits  do not include benefits specified at 45 CFR 146.145(c)(2) through (4).</p><p class="depth0">Incurred means the point in time when the sponsor, health insurance  issuer (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103), employment-based plan, plan  participant, or a combination of these or similar stakeholders, become  responsible for payment of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">Negotiated price concession means any direct or indirect  remuneration (including discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, charge  backs or rebates, cash discounts, free goods contingent on a purchase  agreement, up-front payments, coupons, goods in kind, free or   reduced-price services, grants, or other price concessions or similar  benefits) offered to some or all purchasers, which may include a  sponsor, a health insurance issuer, or an employment-based plan) that  would serve to decrease the costs incurred under the employment-based  plan.</p><p class="depth0">Plan participant means anyone enrolled in an applicable plan  including an early retiree, as defined in this section, a retiree, a  retiree's spouse and dependent, an active employee and an active  employee's spouse and dependent.</p><p class="depth0">Plan year means the year that is designated as the plan year in the  plan document of an employment-based plan, except that if the plan  document does not designate a plan year, if the plan year is not a 12- month plan year, or if there is no plan document, the plan year is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The deductible or limit year used under the plan;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The policy year, if the plan does not impose deductibles or  limits on a 12-month basis;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The sponsor's taxable year, If the plan does not impose  deductibles or limits on a 12-month basis, and either the plan is not  insured or the insurance policy is not renewed on a 12-month basis, or;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The calendar year, in any other case.</p><p class="depth2">Post point-of-sale negotiated price concession means any negotiated  price concession that an employment-based plan or insurer receives with  respect to a given health benefit, after making payment for that health  benefit.</p><p class="depth2">Program means the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program established in  section 1102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="depth2">Secretary means the Secretary of the United States Department of  Health & Human Services or the Secretary's designee.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsor means a plan sponsor as defined in section 3(16)(B) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.  1002(16)(B), except that in the case of a plan maintained jointly by one  employer and an employee organization and for which the employer is the  primary source of financing, the term means the employer.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsor agreement means an agreement between the sponsor and the  United States Department of Health & Human Services, or its designee,  which is made to comply with the provisions of this part.</p>
