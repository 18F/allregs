In the gravimetric and volumetric methods, fuel consumption is determined by weighing the fuel source before and after a test, or by measuring the volume of fuel consumed during a test. Since the distance traveled during the tests is known, the fuel economy, in miles per gallon, can be calculated. Gravimetric and volumetric methods require the use of special test equipment in addition to the emissions measuring equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The carbon balance procedure for measuring fuel consumption relates the carbon products in the exhaust to the amount of fuel burned during the test. This method will be the one used to measure fuel economy unless track or road tests are employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Three values of fuel economy will be reported: for city driving ('75 FTP), for highway driving (HFET), and the combined city/highway value calculated according to this equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.205</p>
