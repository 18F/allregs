Modified  adjusted gross income is based on information you provide to IRS when  you file your Federal income tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> to all affected income-related monthly adjustment  amounts when information for the year specified in paragraph (a) of this  section is provided by IRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When we have used the information in paragraph (b) of this  section, you may provide us with evidence of your modified adjusted  gross income for the year in paragraph (a) of this section. You must  provide a retained copy of your signed Federal income tax return for  that year, if available. If you filed a return for that year, but did  not retain a copy, you must request a transcript or a copy of your  return from IRS and provide it to us. When we use this evidence, we will  later confirm this information with IRS records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When you meet the conditions specified in Sec. 418.1150 because  you have amended your Federal income tax return, or when you believe we  have used information provided by IRS which is incorrect, as described  in Sec. 418.1335, we will use information that you provide directly to  us regarding your modified adjusted gross income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may use information that you give us about your modified  adjusted gross income for a more recent tax year than those discussed in  paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section as described in Secs. 418.1201  through 418.1270.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you fail to file an income tax return for any year after 2004  and IRS informs us that you had modified adjusted gross income above the  threshold applicable 2 years after the tax year when you failed to file  an income tax return, we will impose the highest income-related  adjustment percentage applicable to your income filing status for the  effective year. If we later determine that the amount of the income- related monthly adjustment amount imposed was inconsistent with your  modified adjusted gross income, we will correct it. The rules in 42 CFR  408.40 through 408.92 will apply to the collection of any retroactive  premiums due.</p>
