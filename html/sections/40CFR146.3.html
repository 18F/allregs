                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to the underground injection control program.</p><p class="depth0">Abandoned well means a well whose use has been permanently discontinued or which is in a state of disrepair such that it cannot be used for its intended purpose or for observation purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0">Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in approved States, including any approved modifications or revisions. For RCRA, application also includes the information required by the Director under Sec.  122.25 (contents of Part B of the RCRA application).</p><p class="depth0">Aquifer means a geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.</p><p class="depth0">Area of review means the area surrounding an injection well described according to the criteria set forth in Sec.  146.06 or in the case of an area permit, the project area plus a circumscribing area the width of which is either \1/4\ of a mile or a number calculated according to the criteria set forth in Sec.  146.06.</p><p class="depth0">Casing means a pipe or tubing of appropriate material, of varying diameter and weight, lowered into a borehole during or after drilling in order to support the sides of the hole and thus prevent the walls from caving, to prevent loss of drilling mud into porous ground, or to prevent water, gas, or other fluid from entering or leaving the hole.</p><p class="depth0">Catastrophic collapse means the sudden and utter failure of overlying ``strata'' caused by removal of underlying materials.</p><p class="depth0">Cementing means the operation whereby a cement slurry is pumped into a drilled hole and/or forced behind the casing.</p><p class="depth0">Cesspool means a ``drywell'' that receives untreated sanitary waste containing human excreta, and which sometimes has an open bottom and/or perforated sides.</p><p class="depth0">Confining bed means a body of impermeable or distinctly less permeable material stratigraphically adjacent to one or more aquifers.</p><p class="depth0">Confining zone means a geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of limiting fluid movement above an injection zone.</p><p class="depth0">Contaminant means any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water.</p><p class="depth0">Conventional mine means an open pit or underground excavation for the production of minerals.</p><p class="depth0">Director means the Regional Administrator, the State director or the Tribal director as the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no approved State or Tribal program, and there is an EPA administered program, ``Director'' means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved State or Tribal program, ``Director'' normally means the State or Tribal director. In some circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain actions even when there is an approved State or Tribal program. (For example, when EPA has issued an NPDES permit prior to the approval of a State program, EPA may retain jurisdiction over that permit after program approval; see Sec.  123.69).

through a Class V injection well. For example, the point of injection of a Class V septic system might be the distribution box--the last accessible sampling point before the waste fluids drain into the underlying soils. For a dry well, it is likely to be the well bore itself.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure means the total load or force per unit area acting on a surface.</p><p class="depth0">Project means a group of wells in a single operation.</p><p class="depth0">Radioactive waste means any waste which contains radioactive material in concentrations which exceed those listed in 10 CFR part 20, appendix B, table II column 2.</p><p class="depth0">RCRA means the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (Pub.
