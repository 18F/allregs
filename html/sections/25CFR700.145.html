The estate of a certified  eligible head of household who had not signed a Relocation Contract at  the time of his/her death is not eligible for payment of a replacement  housing benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If one of a married couple who was a certified eligible head of  household dies, the surviving spouse may be paid the same relocation  assistance benefits, including replacement housing payments, which the  couple would have received had death not occurred. If there is no  surviving spouse, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a  guardian to act for minor members of the household. The Commission shall  deal with such guardian and any members of the household who have  attained their majority in a manner to   effect relocation of the remaining household under these regulations.
