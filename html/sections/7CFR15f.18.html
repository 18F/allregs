                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A party may request an order from the ALJ to take the testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence. The application for the order must specify the reason and need for taking testimony by deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The time, place, and manner of taking depositions will be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing agreement, by order of the ALJ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No testimony taken by depositions will be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at the hearing, and ordinarily it will not be received into evidence if the deponent is present and can testify at the hearing. However, when the deponent is present and can testify, the deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at the hearing. Where you have requested a final determination by the ALJ based on the written record without a hearing, the ALJ, in his or her discretion, may receive depositions to supplement the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each party will bear its own expenses associated with the taking of any deposition.</p>
