                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may certify engines sold separately from vehicles in either  of two cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you manufacture recreational engines but not recreational  vehicles, you may ask to certify the engine alone. In your request,  explain why you cannot certify the entire vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you manufacture complete recreational vehicles containing  engines you also sell separately, you may ask to certify all these  engines in a single engine family or in separate engine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you certify an engine under this section, you must use the  test procedures in subpart F of this part. If the test procedures  require vehicle testing, use good engineering judgment to install the  engine in an appropriate vehicle for measuring emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we allow you to certify recreational engines, the vehicles  must meet the applicable emission standards (including evaporative  emission standards) with the engines installed in the appropriate  vehicles. You must prepare installation instructions as described in  Sec.  1051.130 and use good engineering judgment so that the engines  will meet emission standards after proper installation in the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identify and label engines you produce under this section  consistent with the requirements of Sec.  1051.135. On the emission  control information label, identify the manufacturing date of the engine  rather than the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not use the provisions of this section to circumvent or  reduce the stringency of this part's standards or other requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you certify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you may  ask us to   allow you to perform production-line testing on the engine. If you  certify under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, use good engineering  judgment to ensure that these engines are produced in the same manner as  the engines you produce for your vehicles, so that your production-line  testing results under subpart D of this part would apply to them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Apply the provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 for engines certified  under this section as if they were subject to engine-based standards.  For example, you may rely on the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.261 to have  vehicle manufacturers install catalysts that you describe in your  application for certification.
