                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The petrochemical production source category consists of all  processes that produce acrylonitrile, carbon black, ethylene, ethylene  dichloride, ethylene oxide, or methanol, except as specified in  paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. The source category includes  processes that produce the petrochemical as an intermediate in the on- site production of other chemicals as well as processes that produce the  petrochemical as an end product for sale or shipment off site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A process that produces a petrochemical as a byproduct is not  part of the petrochemical production source category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A facility that makes methanol, hydrogen, and/or ammonia from  synthesis gas is part of the petrochemical source category if the annual  mass of methanol produced exceeds the individual annual mass production  levels of both hydrogen recovered as product and ammonia. The facility  is part of subpart P of this part (Hydrogen Production) if the annual  mass of hydrogen recovered as product exceeds the individual annual mass  production levels of both methanol and ammonia. The facility is part of  subpart G of this part (Ammonia Manufacturing) if the annual mass of  ammonia produced exceeds the individual annual mass production levels of  both hydrogen recovered as product and methanol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A direct chlorination process that is operated independently of  an oxychlorination process to produce ethylene dichloride is not part of  the petrochemical production source category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A process that produces bone black is not part of the  petrochemical source category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A process that produces a petrochemical from bio-based feedstock  is not part of the petrochemical production source category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A process that solely distills or recycles waste solvent that  contains a petrochemical is not part of the petrochemical production  source category.
