The term ``system of records'' means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. Violations of the Act by the Contractor and/or its employees may result in the imposition of criminal penalties (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)). The Contractor shall ensure that each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct and that each employee is aware that he/she is subject to criminal penalties for violation of the Act to the same extent as Department of Health and Human Services employees. These provisions also apply to all subcontracts the Contractor awards under this contract which require the design, development or operation of the designated system(s) of records [5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1)]. The contract work statement: (a) identifies the system(s) of records and the design, development, or operation work the Contractor is to perform; and (b) specifies the disposition to be made of such records upon completion of contract performance.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p>
