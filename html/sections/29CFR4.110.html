                                Sec. 4.110  What contracts are covered.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Act covers service contracts of the Federal agencies described  in Sec. Sec. 4.107-4.108. Except as otherwise specifically provided  (see Sec. Sec. 4.115 et seq.), all such contracts, the principal  purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the  use of service employees, are subject to its terms. This is true of  contracts entered into by such agencies with States or their political  subdivisions, as well as such contracts entered into with private  employers. Contracts between a Federal or District of Columbia agency  and another such agency are not within the purview of the Act; however,  ``subcontracts'' awarded under ``prime contracts'' between the Small  Business Administration and another Federal   agency pursuant to various preferential set-aside programs, such as the  8(a) program, are covered by the Act. It makes no difference in the  coverage of a contract whether the contract services are procured  through negotiation or through advertising for bids. Also, the mere fact  that an agreement is not reduced to writing does not mean that the  contract is not within the coverage of the Act. The amount of the  contract is not determinative of the Act's coverage, although the  requirements are different for contracts in excess of $2,500 and for  contracts of a lesser amount. The Act is applicable to the contract if  the principal purpose of the contract is to furnish services, if such  services are to be furnished in the United States, and if service  employees will be used in providing such services. These elements of  coverage will be discussed separately in the following sections.</p>
