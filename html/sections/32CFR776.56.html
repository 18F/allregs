                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Professional independence of a covered USG attorney. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Notwithstanding a judge advocate's status as a commissioned officer  subject, generally, to the authority of superiors, a judge advocate  detailed or assigned to represent an individual member or employee of  the DON is expected to exercise unfettered loyalty and professional  independence during the representation consistent with these Rules and  remains ultimately responsible for acting in the best interest of the  individual client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding a civilian USG attorney's status as a Federal  employee subject, generally, to the authority of superiors, a civilian  USG attorney detailed or assigned to represent an individual member or  employee of the DON is expected to exercise unfettered loyalty and  professional independence during the representation   consistent with these Rules and remains ultimately responsible for  acting in the best interest of the individual client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The exercise of professional judgment in accordance with  paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not, standing alone,  be a basis for an adverse evaluation or other prejudicial action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section recognizes that a judge advocate is a military  officer required by law to obey the lawful orders of superior officers.  It also recognizes the similar status of a civilian USG attorney.  Nevertheless, the practice of law requires the exercise of judgment  solely for the benefit of the client and free of compromising influences  and loyalties. Thus, when a covered USG attorney is assigned to  represent an individual client, neither the attorney's personal  interests, the interests of other clients, nor the interests of third  persons should affect loyalty to the individual client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not all direction given to a subordinate covered attorney is an  attempt to influence improperly the covered attorney's professional  judgment. Each situation must be evaluated by the facts and  circumstances, giving due consideration to the subordinate's training,  experience, and skill. A covered attorney subjected to outside pressures  should make full disclosure of them to the client. If the covered  attorney or the client believes the effectiveness of the representation  has been or will be impaired thereby, the covered attorney should take  proper steps to withdraw from representation of the client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additionally, a judge advocate has a responsibility to report  any instances of unlawful command influence. See R.C.M. 104, MCM, 1998.</p>
