No. 59-02-9) is the chemical [2R,4'R,8prime;R]-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4',8',12'-trimethyl-tridecyl)-6-chromanol. It occurs commercially as a concentrate and is a red, nearly odorless, viscous oil. It is obtained by vacuum steam distillation of edible vegetable oil products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> dl-[alpha]-Tocopherol (CAS Reg. No. 10191-41-0) is a mixture of stereoisomers of 2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4',8',12'-trimethyl-tridecyl)-6-chromanol. It is chemically synthesized by condensing racemic isophytol with trimethyl hydroquinone. It is a pale yellow viscous oil at room temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The ingredients meet the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed.
