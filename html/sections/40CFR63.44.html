                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which would be deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart before the date that the owner or operator has obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under any of the review options available pursuant to Sec. 63.43, the owner or operator of the source(s) shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination rather than any MACT determination under section 112(g) by the permitting authority, and the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority makes a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and has been subject to a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to Sec. 63.43, and the owner and operator obtained a final and legally effective case-by-case MACT determination prior to the promulgation date of such emission standard, then the permitting authority shall (if the initial title V permit has not yet been issued) issue an initial operating permit which incorporates the emission standard or determination, or shall (if the initial title V permit has been issued) revise the operating permit according to the reopening procedures in 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, whichever is relevant, to incorporate the emission standard or determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EPA may include in the emission standard established under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act a specific compliance date for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart and which have submitted the information required by Sec. 63.43 to the EPA before the close of the public comment period for the standard established under section 112(d) of the Act. Such date shall assure that the owner

or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated. In that event, the permitting authority shall incorporate the applicable compliance date in the title V operating permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no compliance date has been established in the promulgated 112(d) or 112(h) standard or section 112(j) determination, for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart, then the permitting authority shall establish a compliance date in the permit that assures that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated or a section 112(j) determination is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and which is the subject of a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to Sec. 63.43, and the level of control required by the emission standard issued under section 112(d) or section 112(h) or the determination issued under section 112(j) is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation or standard in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent terms of the promulgated standard in the title V operating permit applicable to such source(s) and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the prior MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such an operating permit.
