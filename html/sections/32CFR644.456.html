If there is an outstanding maintenance and  operation contract with the lessor, contained in either the lease or in  an independent instrument, which fixes compensation in addition to the  rent, the settlement agreement with the lessor will include the rent and  such part of the compensation for maintenance and operation as will be  necessarily incurred by the lessor during the performance of  restoration.</p>
