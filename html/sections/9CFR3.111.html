                            <p class="depth0">Swim-with-the-dolphin programs shall comply with the requirements in this section, as well as with all other applicable requirements of the regulations pertaining to marine mammals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Space requirements. The primary enclosure for SWTD cetaceans shall contain an interactive area, a buffer area, and a sanctuary area. None of these areas shall be made uninviting to the animals. Movement of cetaceans into the buffer or sanctuary area shall not be restricted in any way. Notwithstanding the space requirements set forth in Sec. 3.104, each of the three areas required for SWTD programs shall meet the following space requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The horizontal dimension for each area must be at least three times the average adult body length of the species of cetacean used in the program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The minimum surface area required for each area is calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Up to two cetaceans:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04SE98.022</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Three cetaceans:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04SE98.023</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional SA for each animal in excess of three:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04SE98.024</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The average depth for sea pens, lagoons, and similar natural enclosures at low tide shall be at least 9 feet. The average depth for any manmade enclosure or other structure not subject to tidal action shall be at least 9 feet. A portion of each area may be excluded when calculating the average depth, but the excluded portion may not be used in calculating whether the interactive, buffer, and sanctuary area meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The minimum volume required for each animal is calculated as follows:
Volume = SA x 9</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Water clarity. Sufficient water clarity shall be maintained so that attendants are able to observe cetaceans and humans at all times while within the interactive area. If water clarity does not allow these observations, the interactive sessions shall be canceled until the required clarity is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employees and attendants. Each SWTD program shall have, at the minimum, the following personnel, with the following minimum backgrounds (each position shall be held by a separate individual, with a sufficient number of attendants to comply with Sec. 3.111(e)(4)):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Licensee or manager--at least one full-time staff member with at least 6 years experience in a professional or managerial position dealing with captive cetaceans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Head trainer/behaviorist--at least one full-time staff member with at least 6 years experience in training cetaceans for SWTD behaviors in the past 10 years, or an equivalent amount of experience involving in-water training of cetaceans, who serves as the head trainer for the SWTD program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trainer/supervising attendant--at least one full-time staff member with at least 3 years training and/or handling experience involving human/cetacean interaction programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Attendant--an adequate number of staff members who are adequately trained in the care, behavior, and training of the program animals. Attendants shall be designated by the trainer, in consultation with the head trainer/behaviorist and licensee/manager, to conduct and monitor interactive sessions in accordance with Sec. 3.111(e); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Attending veterinarian--at least one staff or consultant veterinarian who has at least the equivalent of 2 years full-time experience (4,160 or more hours) with cetacean medicine within the past 10 years, and who is licensed to practice veterinary medicine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Program animals. Only cetaceans that meet the requirements of Sec. 3.111(e)(2) and (3) may be used in SWTD programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Handling. (1) Interaction time (i.e., designated interactive swim sessions) for each cetacean shall not exceed 2 hours per day. Each program cetacean shall have at least one period in each 24 hours of at least 10 continuous hours without public interaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interaction time (i.e., designated interactive swim sessions) for each cetacean shall not exceed 2 hours per day. Each program cetacean shall have at least one period in each 24 hours of at least 10 continuous hours without public interaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All cetaceans used in an interactive session shall be adequately trained and conditioned in human interaction so that they respond in the session to the attendants with appropriate behavior for safe interaction. The head trainer/behaviorist, trainer/supervising attendant, or attendant shall, at all times, control the nature and extent of the cetacean interaction with the public during a session, using the trained responses of the program animal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All cetaceans used in interactive sessions shall be in good health, including, but not limited to, not being infectious. Cetaceans undergoing veterinary treatment may be used in interactive sessions only with the approval of the attending veterinarian.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The ratio of human participants to cetaceans shall not exceed 3:1. The ratio of human participants to attendants or other authorized SWTD personnel (i.e., head trainer/behaviorist or trainer/supervising attendant) shall not exceed 3:1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prior to participating in an SWTD interactive session, members of the public shall be provided with oral and written rules and instructions for the session, to include the telephone and FAX numbers for APHIS, Animal Care, for reporting injuries or complaints. Members of the public shall agree, in writing, to abide by the rules and instructions before being allowed to participate in the session. Any participant who fails to follow the rules or instructions shall be removed from the session by the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> All interactive sessions shall have at least two attendants or other authorized SWTD personnel (i.e., head trainer/behaviorist or trainer/supervising attendant). At least one attendant shall be positioned out of the water. One or more attendants or other authorized SWTD personnel may be positioned in the water. If a facility has more than two incidents during interactive sessions within a year's time span that have been dangerous or harmful to either a cetacean or a human, APHIS, in consultation with the head trainer/behaviorist, will determine if changes in attendant positions are needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> All SWTD programs shall limit interaction between cetaceans and humans so that the interaction does not harm the cetaceans, does not remove the element of choice from the cetaceans by actions such as, but not limited to, recalling the animal from the sanctuary area, and does not elicit unsatisfactory, undesirable, or unsafe behaviors from the cetaceans. All SWTD programs shall prohibit grasping or holding of the cetacean's body, unless under the direct and explicit instruction of an attendant eliciting a

specific cetacean behavior, and shall prevent the chasing or other harassment of the cetaceans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In cases where cetaceans used in an interactive session exhibit unsatisfactory, undesirable, or unsafe behaviors, including, but not limited to, charging, biting, mouthing, or sexual contact with humans, such cetaceans shall either be removed from the interactive area or the session shall be terminated. Written criteria shall be developed by each SWTD program, and shall be submitted to and approved by APHIS \11\ regarding conditions and procedures for maintaining compliance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section; for the termination of a session when removal of a cetacean is not possible; and regarding criteria and protocols for handling program animal(s) exhibiting unsatisfactory, undesirable, or unsafe behaviors, including retraining time and techniques, and removal from the program and/or facility, if appropriate. The head trainer/behaviorist shall determine when operations will be terminated, and when they may resume. In the absence of the head trainer/behaviorist, the determination to terminate a session shall be made by the trainer/supervising attendant. Only the head trainer/behaviorist may determine when a session may be resumed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ Send to Administrator, c/o Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Animal Care, 4700 River Road Unit 84, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1234.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping.
