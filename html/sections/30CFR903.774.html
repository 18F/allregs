                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Part 774 of this chapter, Revision; Renewal; and Transfer,  Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights, applies to any such actions  involving surface coal mining and reclamation operations permits, except  as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No revision to an approved mining or reclamation plan shall be  effective until reviewed and approved by WSC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this chapter before it  is approved and implemented. Any revision to an approved reclamation  plan that may have the potential to adversely affect the achievement of  reclamation and the post-mining land use is a significant permit  revision. In addition, WSC will consider the following factors, as well  as other relevant factors, in determining the significance of a proposed  revision:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Changes in production or recoverability of the coal resource;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Environmental effects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public interest in the operation, or likely interest in the  proposed revision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Possible adverse impacts from the proposed revision on fish or  wildlife, endangered species, bald or golden eagles, or cultural  resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The regulatory authority will approve or disapprove non- significant permit revisions within a reasonable time after receiving a  complete and accurate revision application. Significant revisions and  renewals shall be approved or disapproved under the provisions of Sec.  903.773(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any person having an interest that is or may be adversely  affected by a decision on the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit  rights, may submit written comments on the application to WSC. Comments  may be submitted within 30 days of either the publication of the  newspaper notice required by Sec. 774.17(b)(2) of this chapter, or  receipt   of an administratively complete application, whichever is later. For  purposes of this paragraph, a person includes, but is not limited to an  official of any Federal, State, or local government agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within 30 days from the last publication of the newspaper  notice, written comments or objections to an application for significant  revision or renewal of a permit may be submitted to the regulatory  authority by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person having an interest that is or may be adversely  affected by the decision on the application; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public entities notified under Sec. 773.6(a)(3) of this chapter  of the proposed mining operations on the environment within their areas  of responsibility.
