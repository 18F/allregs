It applies to money  paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance  extended after January 9, 1965, pursuant to an application approved  prior to such effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part does not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance  by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, property  transferred, or other assistance extended before January 9, 1965, except  where such assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of this  Department or of any other agency whose responsibilities are now  exercised by this Department, (3) any assistance to any individual who  is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) any  employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment  agency, or labor organization except to the extent described in Sec.  8.4(c). The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not  listed in Appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise  applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal  financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted  may be added to the list by notice published in the Federal Register.</p>
