These withholdings stop the month after the month in which the annuitant or compensationer reaches age 65. There are no withholdings from individuals who retired or began receiving compensation before January 1, 1990, and who elected the 75 percent reduction. For the purpose of this paragraph, an individual who separates from service after meeting the requirements for an immediate annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8412(g) is considered to retire on the day before the annuity begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an annuitant or compensationer who elects to continue Basic insurance and chooses the maximum reduction of 75 percent after age 65 under Sec. 870.702(a)(2), the annuitant's share of the premium is withheld monthly and the compensationer's share is withheld every 4 weeks.
