                            <p class="depth0">The charter of a Federal stock association shall be in the following form, except that an association that has converted from the mutual form pursuant to part 192 of this chapter shall include in its charter a section establishing a liquidation account as required by Sec. 192.3(c)(13) of this chapter. A charter for a Federal stock savings bank shall substitute the term ``savings bank'' for ``association.'' Charters may also include any preapproved optional provision contained in Sec. 152.4 of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Stock Charter</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Corporate title. The full corporate title of the association is ----.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2. Office. The home office shall be located in ---- [city, state].</p><p class="depth0">Section 3. Duration. The duration of the association is perpetual.</p><p class="depth0">Section 4. Purpose and powers. The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'').</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Capital stock. The total number of shares of all classes of the capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is ----, all of which shall be common stock of par [or if no par is specified then shares shall have a stated] value of ---- per share. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without the approval of its shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares shall be paid in full before their issuance and shall not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services shall constitute payment or part payment

for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares shall be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted to the association), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, shall be conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend shall be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.</p><p class="depth0">Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) shall be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.</p><p class="depth0">The holders of the common stock shall exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that there shall be no such cumulative voting. Subject to any provision for a liquidation account, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock shall be entitled, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the association, to receive the remaining assets of the association available for distribution, in cash or in kind. Each share of common stock shall have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Preemptive rights. Holders of the capital stock of the association shall not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the association which may be issued.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7.

Amendment of charter. Except as provided in Section 5, no amendment, addition, alteration, change or repeal of this charter shall be made, unless such is proposed by the board of directors of the association, approved by the shareholders by a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting, unless a higher vote is otherwise required, and approved or preapproved by the OCC.</p><p class="depth0">Attest:________________________________________________________________Secretary of the Association</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________President or Chief Executive Officer of the Association</p><p class="depth0">Attest:________________________________________________________________Deputy Comptroller for Licensing</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________Comptroller of the Currency</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date:________________________________________________________</p>
