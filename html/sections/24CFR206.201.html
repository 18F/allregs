                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This subpart identifies servicing practices that the Secretary considers acceptable mortgage servicing practices of lending institutions servicing mortgages insured by the Secretary. Failure to comply with this subpart shall not be a basis for denial of the insurance benefits, but a pattern of refusal or failure to comply will be cause for withdrawal of HUD mortgagee approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Importance of timely payments. The paramount servicing responsibility is the need to make timely payments in full as required by the mortgage. Any failure of a mortgagee to make all payments required by the mortgage in a timely manner will be grounds for administrative sanctions authorized by regulations, including 2 CFR part 2424 (Debarment, Suspension, and Limited Denial of Participation), and part 25 of this title (Mortgagee Review Board).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility for servicing. The provisions of Sec. 203.502 of this chapter pertaining to the responsibility for servicing shall apply to mortgages insured under this part, except that references in that section to payments by a mortgagor shall mean payments to the mortgagor.
