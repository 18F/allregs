                                Sec. 570.129  Limited driving of automobiles and trucks by 17-year-olds.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 13(c)(6) of the FLSA provides an exemption for 17-year-olds,  but not 16-year-olds, who, as part of their employment, perform the  occasional and incidental driving of automobiles and trucks on public  highways under specified conditions. These specific conditions, which  are contained in HO 2 (Sec. 570.52), include that the automobile or  truck may not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, the driving must  be restricted to daylight hours, the vehicle must be equipped with a  seat belt or similar restraining device for the driver and for any  passengers, and the employer must instruct the employee that such belts  or other devices must be used. In addition, the 17-year-old must hold a  State license valid for the type of driving involved in the job, have  successfully completed a State-approved driver education course, and  have no records of any moving violations at the time of his or her hire.  The exemption also prohibits the minor from performing any driving  involving the towing of vehicles; route deliveries or route sales; the  transportation for hire of property, goods, or passengers; urgent, time- sensitive deliveries; or the transporting of more than three passengers  at any one time. The exemption also places limitations on the number of  trips the 17-year-old may make each day and restricts the driving to a  30-mile radius of the minor's place of employment.
