                                Sec. 393.116  What are the rules for securing logs?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The rules in this section are applicable to the  transportation of logs with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Logs that are unitized by banding or other comparable means may  be transported in accordance with the general cargo securement rules of  Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loads that consist of no more than four processed logs may be  transported in accordance with the general cargo securement rules of  Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Firewood, stumps, log debris and other such short logs must be  transported in a vehicle or container enclosed on both sides, front, and  rear and of adequate strength to contain them. Longer logs may also be  so loaded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Components of a securement system. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Logs must be transported  on a vehicle designed and built, or adapted, for the transportation of  logs. Any such vehicle must be fitted with bunks, bolsters, stakes or  standards, or other equivalent means, that cradle the logs and prevent  them from rolling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All vehicle components involved in securement of logs must be  designed and built to withstand all anticipated operational forces  without failure, accidental release or permanent deformation. Stakes or  standards that are not permanently attached to the vehicle must be  secured in a manner that prevents unintentional separation from the  vehicle in transit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tiedowns must be used in combination with the stabilization  provided by bunks, stakes, and bolsters to secure the load unless the  logs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> are transported in a crib-type log trailer (as defined in 49 CFR  393.5), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> are loaded in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The aggregate working load limit for tiedowns used to secure a  stack of logs on a frame vehicle, or a flatbed vehicle equipped with  bunks, bolsters, or stakes must be at least one-sixth the weight of the  stack of logs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of securement system. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Logs must be solidly packed, and  the outer bottom logs must be in contact with and resting solidly  against the bunks, bolsters, stakes or standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each outside log on the side of a stack of logs must touch at  least two stakes, bunks, bolsters, or standards. If one end does not  actually touch a stake, it must rest on other logs in a stable manner  and must extend beyond the stake, bunk, bolster or standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The center of the highest outside log on each side or end must  be below the top of each stake, bunk or standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each log that is not held in place by contact with other logs or  the stakes, bunks, or standards must be held in place by a tiedown.  Additional tiedowns or securement devices must be used when the  condition of the wood results in such low friction between logs that  they are likely to slip upon each other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Securement of shortwood logs loaded crosswise on frame, rail and  flatbed vehicles. In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section, each stack of logs loaded crosswise must meet the  following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In no case may the end of a log in the lower tier extend more  than one-third of the log's total length beyond the nearest supporting  structure on the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When only one stack of shortwood is loaded crosswise, it must be  secured with at least two tiedowns. The tiedowns must attach to the  vehicle frame at the front and rear of the load, and must cross the load  in this direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When two tiedowns are used, they must be positioned at  approximately one-third and two-thirds of the length of the logs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A vehicle that is more than 10 meters (33 feet) long must be  equipped with center stakes, or comparable devices, to divide it into  sections approximately equal in length. Where a vehicle is so divided,  each tiedown must secure the highest log on each side of the center  stake, and must be fastened below these logs. It may be fixed at each  end and tensioned from the middle, or fixed in the middle and tensioned  from each end, or it may pass through a pulley or equivalent device in  the middle and be tensioned from one end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any structure or stake that is subjected to an upward force when  the tiedowns are tensioned must be anchored to resist that force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If two stacks of shortwood are loaded side-by-side, in addition  to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this  section, they must be loaded so that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is no space between the two stacks of logs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The outside of each stack is raised at least 2.5 cm (1 in)  within 10 cm (4 in) of the end of the logs or the side of the vehicle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The highest log is no more than 2.44 m (8 ft) above the deck;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At least one tiedown is used lengthwise across each stack of  logs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Securement of logs loaded lengthwise on flatbed and frame  vehicles--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shortwood. In addition to meeting the requirements of  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each stack of shortwood loaded  lengthwise on a frame vehicle or on a flatbed must be cradled in a bunk  unit or contained by stakes and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Secured to the vehicle by at least two tiedowns, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If all the logs in any stack are blocked in the front by a  front-end structure strong enough to restrain the load, or by another  stack of logs, and blocked in the rear by another stack of logs or  vehicle end structure, the stack may be secured with one tiedown. If one  tiedown is used, it must be positioned about midway between the stakes,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be bound by at least two tiedown-type devices such as wire  rope, used as wrappers that encircle the entire load at locations along  the load that provide effective securement. If wrappers are being used  to bundle the logs together, the wrappers are not required to be  attached to the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Longwood. Longwood must be cradled in two or more bunks and must  either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be secured to the vehicle by at least two tiedowns at locations  that provide effective securement, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be bound by at least two tiedown-type devices, such as wire  rope, used as wrappers that encircle the entire load at locations along  the load that provide effective securement. If a wrapper(s) is being  used to bundle the logs together, the wrapper is not required to be  attached to the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Securement of logs transported on pole trailers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The load  must be secured by at least one tiedown at each bunk, or alternatively,  by at least two tiedowns used as wrappers that encircle the entire load  at locations along the load that provide effective securement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The front and rear wrappers must be at least 3.04 meters (10  feet) apart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Large diameter single and double log loads must be immobilized  with chock blocks or other equivalent means to prevent shifting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Large diameter logs that rise above bunks must be secured to the  underlying load with at least two additional wrappers.
