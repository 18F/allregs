The $800 or $1,600 exemption will be applied to the aggregate fair retail value in the country of acquisition of the articles acquired abroad which are subject to the highest rates of duty. If an internal revenue tax is applicable, it will be combined with the duty in determining which rates are highest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gifts. An article acquired abroad by a returning resident and imported by him to be disposed of after importation as his bona fide gift is considered to be for the personal use of the returning resident and may be included in the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. Cigars, cigarettes, manufactured tobacco, and alcoholic beverages may be included in the exemption to which a returning resident is entitled, with the following limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No more than 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars may be included, except that in the case of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands of the United States the cigarette limit is 1,000, not more than 200 of which shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such locations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No alcoholic beverages will be included in the case of an individual who has not attained the age of 21; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No more than 1 liter of alcoholic beverages may be included, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual returning directly or indirectly from American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the Virgin Islands of the United States may include in the exemption not more than 5 liters of alcoholic beverages, not more than 1 liter of which was acquired elsewhere than in such locations and not more than 4 liters of which were produced elsewhere than in such locations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual returning directly from a beneficiary country as defined in U.S. Note 4 to Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) may include in the exemption not more than 2 liters of alcoholic beverages if at least 1 liter is the product of one or more beneficiary countries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption not applicable. The exemption does not apply to articles intended for sale or acquired on commission, i.e., for the account of another person, with or without compensation for the service rendered. Articles acquired on one journey and left in a foreign country cannot be allowed the exemption accruing upon the return of

the resident from a subsequent journey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Remainder not applicable to subsequent journey.
