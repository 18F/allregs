and installations used to provide electric power and light at the jobsite. These sections apply to installations, both temporary and permanent, used on the jobsite; but these sections do not apply to existing permanent installations that were in place before the construction activity commenced.</p><p class="depth2">Note: If the electrical installation is made in accordance with the National Electrical Code ANSI/NFPA 70-1984, exclusive of Formal Interpretations and Tentative Interim Amendments, it will be deemed to be in compliance with Sec. Sec. 1926.403 through 1926.408, except for Sec. Sec. 1926.404(b)(1) and 1926.405(a)(2)(ii) (E), (F), (G), and (J).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Not covered. Sections 1926.402 through 1926.408 do not cover installations used for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric energy, including related communication, metering, control, and transformation installations. (However, these regulations do cover portable and vehicle-mounted generators used to provide power for equipment used at the jobsite.) See subpart V of this part for the construction of power distribution and transmission lines.</p>
