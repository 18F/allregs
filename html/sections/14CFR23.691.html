                            <p class="depth0">If the function of an artificial stall barrier, for example, stick pusher, is used to show compliance with Sec. 23.201(c), the system must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With the system adjusted for operation, the plus and minus airspeeds at which downward pitching control will be provided must be established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Considering the plus and minus airspeed tolerances established by paragraph (a) of this section, an airspeed must be selected for the activation of the downward pitching control that provides a safe margin above any airspeed at which any unsatisfactory stall characteristics occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the stall warning required Sec. 23.07, a warning that is clearly distinguishable to the pilot under all expected flight conditions without requiring the pilot's attention, must be provided for faults that would prevent the system from providing the required pitching motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each system must be designed so that the artificial stall barrier can be quickly and positively disengaged by the pilots to prevent unwanted downward pitching of the airplane by a quick release (emergency) control that meets the requirements of Sec. 23.1329(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A preflight check of the complete system must be established and the procedure for this check made available in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Preflight checks that are critical to the safety of the airplane must be included in the limitations section of the AFM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For those airplanes whose design includes an autopilot system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A quick release (emergency) control installed in accordance with Sec. 23.1329(b) may be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (d), of this section, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pitch servo for that system may be used to provide the stall downward pitching motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In showing compliance with Sec. 23.1309, the system must be evaluated to determine the effect that any announced or unannounced failure may have on the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with any adverse conditions that may result from such failures. This evaluation must consider the hazards that would result from the airplane's flight characteristics if the system was not provided, and the hazard that may result from unwanted downward pitching motion, which could result from a failure at airspeeds above the selected stall speed.
