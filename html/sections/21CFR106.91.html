                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During manufacture, a manufacturer shall test each production  aggregate for nutrients as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each nutrient premix used in the manufacture of an infant  formula shall be tested for each nutrient (required under Sec. 107.100  of this chapter or otherwise added by the manufacturer) that the  manufacturer is relying on the premix to provide, to ensure that the  premix is in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the manufacturing process, after the addition of the  premix, or at the final product stage but before distribution, each  production aggregate of infant formula shall be tested for at least one  indicator nutrient for each of the nutrient premixes used in the infant  formula to confirm that the nutrients supplied by each of the premixes  are present, in the proper concentration, in the production aggregate of  infant formula.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At the final product stage, before distribution of an infant  formula, each production aggregate shall be tested for vitamins A, C, E,  and thiamin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the manufacturing process or at the final product stage,  before distribution, each production aggregate shall be tested for all  nutrients required to be included in such formula under Sec. 107.100 of  this chapter for which testing is not conducted for compliance with  paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section and for any nutrient added  by the manufacturer for which testing is not conducted for compliance  with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A manufacturer shall test each production aggregate of finished  product for nutrients as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an infant formula that is a new infant formula the  manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and at the  final product stage, a representative sample of the first production  aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form (powder,  ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all nutrients  required under Sec. 107.100 of this chapter and all other nutrients  added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such testing  every 4 months thereafter throughout the shelf life of the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Food and Drug Administration will exempt the manufacturer  from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if the  manufacturer of a new infant formula requests an exemption and provides  analytical data, as required under Sec. 106.120(b)(7), that demonstrates  that the stability of the new infant formula will likely not differ from  the stability of formulas with similar composition, processing, and  packaging for which there are extensive stability data. A manufacturer  exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section  would be required to test the first production aggregate according to  the requirements of Sec. 106.91(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and  at the final product stage, a representative sample of each subsequent  production aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form  (powder, ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all  nutrients required under Sec. 107.100 of this chapter and all other  nutrients added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such  testing at the end of the shelf life of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of  this section do not substantiate the shelf life of the infant formula,  the manufacturer shall address, as appropriate, all production  aggregates of formula released and pending release for distribution that  are implicated by the testing results, such as by conducting the testing  required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a subsequently produced  production aggregate to substantiate the shelf life of the infant  formula or revising the use by date for such product so that such date  is substantiated by the stability testing results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(2) of this  section show that any required nutrient is not present in the production  aggregate of infant formula at the level required by   Sec. 107.100 of this chapter or that any nutrient added by the  manufacturer is not present at the level declared on the label of the  production aggregate of infant formula, the manufacturer shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Investigate the cause of such variance in the level of any  required or added nutrient;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evaluate the significance, if any, of the results for other  production aggregates of the same formula that have been released for  distribution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Address, as appropriate, all production aggregates of formula  released and pending release for distribution that are implicated by the  testing results; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Determine whether it is necessary to conduct the testing  required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The testing required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this  section is not required to evaluate the level of minerals present in the  infant formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All quality control testing shall be conducted using  appropriate, scientifically valid test methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A manufacturer shall make and retain quality control records in  accordance with Sec. 106.100(e)(5)(i).
