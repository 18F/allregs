                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Contracting Officer shall not award a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale of special forest products to a declared high bidder unless that officer makes an affirmative determination that the person is responsible. In the absence of information clearly establishing that the declared high bidder is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the declared high bidder is not responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to make an affirmative determination of responsibility, the Contracting Officer must find that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The declared high bidder has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or the ability to obtain such resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The declared high bidder is able to complete the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument within the relevant term, taking into consideration the declared high bidder's other existing commercial and governmental obligations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The declared high bidder has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The declared high bidder has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies

suitable for harvesting the special forest product(s) and for meeting applicable resource protection requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The declared high bidder is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument under all applicable laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The declared high bidder has a satisfactory performance record on contracts, permits, and other agreements with the U.S. Government. Failure to apply sufficient diligence and perseverance to perform a contract, permit, or other instrument is strong evidence that a declared high bidder is not responsible. A declared high bidder that is, or has been deficient in performance shall be deemed not responsible, unless the declared high bidder demonstrates that the deficiency arose from circumstances beyond their reasonable control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Affiliated concerns, as defined in 36 CFR 223.49(a)(5), are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the declared high bidder that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the responsible Forest Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the responsibility of the declared high bidder.</p>
