Although the Reading Room shall try to make timely  responses to such requests, certain factors such as the length of a  request, the volume of other pending requests, and the impact of other  responsibilities of the staff assigned to such duties may cause some  delays. A fee may be charged for such documents under appropriate DOD  and Department of the Army directives and regulations. The manual that  accompanies the index of decisions shall notify the public that if an  applicant indicates that a review is scheduled for a specific date, an  effort will be made to provide requested decisional documents before  that date. The individual or organization will be advised if that cannot  be accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the  Reading Room (including requests for purchase of indexes) shall be  addressed to:  DA Military Review Board Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room  1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</p>
