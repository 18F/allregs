                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a State may receive revenues from provider-related donations without a reduction in FFP, only in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this section relating to provider-related donations for outstationed eligibility workers are effective on October 1, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Permissible donations. Subject to the limitations specified in Sec.  433.67, a State may receive, without a reduction in FFP, provider-related donations that meet at least one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The donations must be bona fide donations, as defined in Sec.  433.54; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The donations are made by a hospital, clinic, or similar entity (such as a Federally-qualified health center) for the direct costs of State or local agency personnel who are stationed at the facility to determine the eligibility (including eligibility redeterminations) of individuals for Medicaid or to provide outreach services to eligible (or potentially eligible) Medicaid individuals. Direct costs of outstationed eligibility workers refers to the costs of training, salaries and fringe benefits associated with each outstationed worker and similar allocated costs of State or local agency support staff, and a prorated cost of outreach activities applicable to the outstationed workers at these sites. The prorated costs of outreach activities will be calculated taking the percent of State outstationed eligibility workers at a facility to total outstationed eligibility workers in the State, and multiplying the percent by the total cost of outreach activities in the State. Costs for such items as State agency overhead and provider office space are not allowable for this purpose.
