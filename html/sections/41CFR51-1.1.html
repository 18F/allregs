The Committee for Purchase from People who  are Blind or Severely Disabled (hereinafter the Committee) was  established by the Javits-Wagner--O'Day Act, Public Law 92-28, 85 Stat.  77 (1971), as amended, 41 U.S.C. 46-48c (hereinafter the JWOD Act). The  Committee is responsible for implementation of a comprehensive program  designed to enforce this policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the policy of the Committee to encourage all Federal  entities and employees to provide the necessary support to ensure that  the JWOD Act is implemented in an effective manner. This support  includes purchase of products and services published on the Committee's  Procurement List through appropriate channels from nonprofit agencies  employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities  designated by the Committee; recommendations to the Committee of new  commodities and services suitable for addition to the Procurement List;  and cooperation with the Committee and the central nonprofit agencies in  the provision of such data as the Committee may decide is necessary to  determine suitability for addition to the Procurement List.
