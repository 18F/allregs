                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Quantity to be diverted. On or before November 30 of each crop year, the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall announce the quantity of raisins eligible for a raisin diversion program: Provided, That, for the 2003 diversion program, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year. On or before January 15 of each crop year, the Committee, with the approval the Secretary, may announce an increase in the tonnage eligible for a raisin diversion program: Provided, That, for the 2002 Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisin diversion program, the Committee may announce an increase in the quantity of tonnage eligible for the program later than January 15: And provided further, That, for the 2003 and subsequent raisin diversion programs, the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may announce an increase in the tonnage eligible for a raisin diversion program on or before May 1 of each crop year. The quantity eligible for diversion may be announced for any of the following varietal types of raisins: Natural (sun-dried) Seedless, Muscat (including other raisins with seeds), Sultana, Zante Currant, Monukka, and Other Seedless raisins. At the same time, the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall determine and announce to producers, handlers, and the cooperative bargaining association(s) the allowable harvest cost to be applicable to such diversion tonnage. The factors to be reviewed by the Committee in determining allowable harvest costs shall include but not be limited to: Costs for picking, turning, rolling, boxing, paper

trays, vineyard terracing, hauling to the handler, and crop insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quantity to be diverted.

For any crop year's diversion program, the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limit the entire program to production units on which producers agree to remove vines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limit a portion of the program to production units on which producers agree to remove vines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Limit the production cap to a percentage (less than or equal to 100 percent) of the yield per acre of the specific production unit for production units on which producers agree to divert production by methods other than vine removal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Limit participation in a vine removal program to producers who agree not to replant raisin-variety vines for a period not to exceed 5 years and who agree to compensate the Committee for appropriate damages if raisin-variety vines are replanted. Damages collected by the Committee pursuant to this subparagraph shall be deposited in the reserve pool fund of the reserve pool applicable to the particular diversion program and be distributed to the equity holders in that pool: Provided, That, if such reserve pool has been closed and equity distributed, damages collected shall be deposited in the next open reserve pool of the crop year closest to the applicable diversion pool. If a determination is made by the Committee that a producer violated the agreement not to replant and is subject to damages, the producer may appeal the Committee's decision in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Specify how tonnage available to producers who agree to divert production by means other than through vine removal will be allotted, either pro-rata to remaining applicants, or by lottery to remaining applicants for complete production units if a minimal amount of tonnage remains; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Limit a program that is applicable to partial production units by specifying the portion of the production units that can be diverted, or like provisions to maintain the integrity of the program.</p><p class="depth4">Additional provisions provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be announced at the time the tonnage available for that season's diversion program is announced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for diversion certificates. Any producer desiring to participate in a raisin diversion program shall file with the Committee, by certified mail, prior to December 20 of the crop year, an application on Form RAC-1000, ``Application for a Raisin Diversion Program'' together with a copy of any two of the following four documents: Plot Map from the County Hall of Records; irrigation tax bill; county property tax bill; or any other document containing an Assessors Parcel Number: Provided, That, for the 2003 diversion program, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year. Such application shall include at least the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the producer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The location and size of the production unit to be diverted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The raisin production by varietal type on such production unit during the prior crop year or the last crop year eligible for such diversion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The handler to whom such raisins were delivered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement identifying whether the applicant will remove the vines in the production unit under the program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement that all persons with an equity interest in the grapes in the production unit to be diverted, in the vines, or the land on which the grapes were produced consent to the filing of the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A statement that the producer agrees to comply with the regulations established for a raisin diversion program.</p><p class="depth3">The producer applicant shall sign the application certifying that the information contained therein is true and correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Handling of applications. After the Committee receives the producer applications, it shall review them to determine whether all the required information has been provided and appears reliable. Any incomplete application shall be returned to the producer applicant for correction together with a

statement of the error or omission in the application. The applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to correct such application. However, such correction must be received by the Committee on or before January 12: Provided, That, for the 2003 diversion program, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Priority of applications and allocation of tonnage. (1) Those producer applications indicating that the vines on the producing units will be removed shall receive first priority over other applications when reserve tonnage under the program is to be allocated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those producer applications indicating that the vines on the producing units will be removed shall receive first priority over other applications when reserve tonnage under the program is to be allocated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if the entire program, or a portion of the program, is limited to production units on which producers agree to remove vines, and the production volume in such vine removal applications exceeds the amount of diversion tonnage available for vine removal, a lottery will be held to allocate such vine removal tonnage among the respective applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remaining tonnage available under a diversion program, after that allocated to producer applications indicating that the vines of the producing units will be removed, shall be allocated by the Committee either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pro-rata to remaining applicants; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To remaining applicants by a lottery for complete production units, if a minimal amount of tonnage remains.

In conducting any lottery under this section, the Committee may group producer applications on a handler-by-handler basis, and separate lotteries will be held for each group. The diversion tonnage of raisins available for each such group in each lottery may not exceed the percentage of total handler acquisitions acquired by the group's handler during the previous crop year. If diversion tonnage exists after such group lotteries, such remaining diversion tonnage may be allocated by one lottery of all remaining producer applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval of applications. The Committee shall notify the applicant for diversion, in writing, as to whether or not the application has been approved. If the application is not approved, the notification shall state the reason(s) for disapproving the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure of information. The applicant, whose application has been approved, agrees that by participating in the raisin diversion program, the information in the application may be disclosed to the Committee, its representatives, or agents. The Committee, its representatives, or agents may not use this information for any personal use and shall comply with all applicable provisions pertaining to the unauthorized disclosure of such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Verification. Any applicant whose application has been approved, authorizes Committee representatives and agents to have access to the production unit in the diversion program during reasonable business hours during the crop year to confirm compliance with the program. Notice will be provided to the applicant of such visits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Compliance--(1) Methods of diversion. An approved applicant shall be required to remove the vines, spur-prune the vines, remove the bunches or take other means to preclude grapes from being produced and harvested on the production unit: Provided, That vine removal may be the only means of diversion in some seasons as determined and announced by the Committee. Bunches which occur on vines in an approved production unit shall be removed and destroyed by the applicant before maturity. If the Committee representatives or agents determine that there is an average of more than four bunches per vine remaining on an approved production unit, the producer shall be notified immediately by certified mail, in writing, and given 2 weeks to remove such bunches. Grafting vines of one varietal type to another varietal type does not constitute removal of vines under the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods of diversion. An approved applicant shall be required to remove the vines, spur-prune the vines, remove the bunches or take other means to preclude grapes from being produced and harvested on the production unit: Provided, That vine removal may be the only means of diversion in some seasons as determined and announced by the Committee. Bunches which occur on vines in an approved production unit shall be removed and destroyed by the applicant before maturity. If the Committee representatives or agents determine that there is an average of more than four bunches per vine remaining on an approved production unit, the producer shall be notified immediately by certified mail, in writing, and given 2 weeks to remove such bunches. Grafting vines of one varietal type to another varietal type does not constitute removal of vines under the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Period of diversion. An approved applicant must remove the grapes, or vines, indicated on the application within the production unit, or portion thereof, designated within the application not later than June 1 of the crop year in which a diversion program is implemented. Producers who remove the vines on a production unit after August 15 may qualify for a diversion

program for that crop year if a diversion program is announced and if diversion on that unit and vine removal after August 15 can be documented and verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to divert. Any raisin producer who does not take the necessary measures to remove the grapes on an approved production unit, or portion thereof, by June 1, or any raisin producer who has indicated the removal of vines or the intent to remove the vines and who does not remove such vines on an approved production unit by June 1, shall not be issued a diversion certificate, may be subject to liquidated damages and interest charges as provided in paragraph (q) of this section, may be subject to an injunctive action under the Act, and may be denied the opportunity to participate in the next diversion program, when implemented: Provided: That any producer who has more than one production unit and fails to divert on an approved production unit or portion thereof may be denied the opportunity to participate on all of that producer's production units, in the next diversion program. For spur-pruned vines, this date may be extended 2 weeks from the date of the inspection of a producer's vineyard if more than 4 bunches on spur-pruned vines are present at the time of inspection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issuance of certificates. When preliminary percentages are announced, the Committee shall issue diversion certificates to those approved applicants who have removed grapes in accordance with this section. Such certificates shall represent an amount of reserve tonnage raisins equal to the amount of raisins diverted from the production unit(s), or portion(s) thereof, specified in the producer application, or additional quantity granted by the Committee when vines are diverted through vine removal or any other means established by the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary. If, prior to issuance of a certificate, the Committee is notified by an approved applicant that such applicant's interest in the production unit(s), or portion(s) thereof, involved in the program has been transferred to another person, the Committee may substitute the transferee for the applicant provided the transferee agrees to comply with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Submission of diversion certificates from producer to handlers. Diversion certificates may be submitted by producers only to handlers. The handler shall pay the producer for the free tonnage applicable to the diversion certificate minus the established harvest cost for the entire tonnage shown on the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Redemption of certificates. Any handler holding certificates may redeem such certificates for reserve pool raisins from the Committee. To redeem a certificate, a handler must present the diversion certificate to the Committee and pay the Committee an amount equal to the established harvest costs plus an amount equal to the payment for receiving, storing, fumigating, handling, and inspecting raisins as specified in Sec. 989.401 for the entire tonnage shown on the certificate. Handlers who acquire diversion certificates from producers shall report acquisitions of such certificates and submit them for redemption in a manner and for the reporting periods provided in Sec. 989.173(b) for the acquisition of raisins acquired from producers. The Committee shall issue a reserve release entitling the handler to an amount of reserve pool raisins equal to the entire amount of tonnage shown on the certificate. Upon receipt of the diversion certificate, the Committee shall note on the certificate that it is cancelled. Diversion certificates will only be valid and honored if presented to the Committee for redemption on or before December 15 of the crop year for which they were issued: Provided, That, for the 2002 diversion program for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Lost, damaged, or destroyed certificates. The Committee should be notified of any lost, damaged, or destroyed certificates as quickly as possible by a handler or producer so that appropriate measures such as issuing new certificates may be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Appeals. If a determination is made by the Committee that a producer has not complied with these regulations and is not entitled to a diversion certificate, that a producer is subject to liquidated damages and interest or that a producer is denied the opportunity to participate in the next RDP, such producer may request a hearing before an appeals subcommittee established by the Committee. If a producer disagrees with the subcommittee's decision, the producer may request the Committee to review the subcommittee's decision. If the producer disagrees with the Committee's decision upon review, the producer may, through the Committee, request the Secretary's review of the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Voiding certificates. If, subsequent to a diversion certificate being issued to a producer but before it has been submitted to a handler, the Committee determines that the producer did not comply with these regulations, it shall void the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Production units. (1) For the purpose of the raisin diversion program, a production unit is a clearly defined geographic area with permanent boundaries (either natural or man-made). A producer must be able to document to the Committee the previous year's production data for that specific area by means of sales receipts or other deliveries or transfer documents which indicate the creditable fruit weight delivered to handlers from that specific area. If the information submitted by producers on the application concerning a unit's production is significantly greater than past production on the unit, production on neighboring units, or the industry norm, or the production is unable to be verified based on submitted documentation, the Committee may request additional documentation such as tray count, payroll records, prior years' production, and insurance records to substantiate the tonnage of raisins produced on all production units that such applicant controls or owns. Producers would not be precluded from submitting other information substantiating production if those producers desired. A new production unit will not be eligible for the raisin diversion program until at least 1 year's production has been grown and is documented. An existing production unit, transferred to a new or expanding producer, is eligible for the raisin diversion program as soon as the previous year's production can be properly documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of the raisin diversion program, a production unit is a clearly defined geographic area with permanent boundaries (either natural or man-made).

An existing production unit, transferred to a new or expanding producer, is eligible for the raisin diversion program as soon as the previous year's production can be properly documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of the raisin diversion program, a partial production unit must have two permanent, contiguous boundaries (either natural or man-made).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Handling of reserve pool tonnage released when diversion certificates are redeemed. Handlers shall comply with the applicable provisions of the order and administrative rules and regulations for the reserve pool tonnage released under the raisin diversion program in the same manner as raisins acquired from producers. Such provisions shall include, but not be limited to, reporting, satisfying reserve pool obligations, payment of assessments, storing reserve tonnage, and the remedies in the event of failure to deliver reserve tonnage raisins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Liquidated damages and interest charges. By applying to participate in a raisin diversion program, an applicant agrees that the failure of the approved applicant to timely remove the vines or grapes will cause serious and substantial damage to the program and the raisin industry and that, in consideration of the approval of the application, such applicant will pay liquidated damages and interest to the Committee, in the event of such failure to timely remove vines or grapes. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the amount of such liquidated damages, the following amount, which is a fair measure of damages and not a penalty, shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the liquidated damages shall be computed by multiplying the tonnage on the approved diversion application (Form RAC-1000) by the harvest cost determined and announced by the Committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each approved applicant shall, with respect to liquidated damages not paid by July 1, pay to the Committee interest on such unpaid liquidated damages at the rate of the prime rate of the bank in which the Committee has its reserve pool funds deposited, on the day the liquidated damages become delinquent, plus 2 percent, and further

such rate of interest shall be added to the unpaid amount, monthly, until the liquidated damages plus applicable interest are paid: Provided, That for the program specified in paragraph (u) of this section, the applicable date concerning liquidated damages not paid, shall be September 1 instead of July 1 as referenced in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liquidated damages and interest collected by the Committee pursuant to this subparagraph shall be deposited in the reserve pool fund of the reserve pool applicable to the particular diversion program and be distributed to the equity holders in that pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Notification. If any changes are made in the terms and conditions of the diversion program after a producer's application has been approved, the Committee will notify the producer of such changes and the producer will be given 10 calendar days to agree to the revised terms, or to withdraw from the program. Failure of the producer to notify the Committee in writing of its intention to withdraw from the program within 10 calendar days from the date of the Committee's notice will constitute agreement to the revised terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Additional opportunity for vine removal. The Committee may announce a date later than that provided in Sec. 989.156(b), by which producers, who agree to remove the vines on a production unit may file an application to participate in a raisin diversion program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the 2002 Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisin diversion program, additional opportunity for vine removal shall be provided in accordance with paragraph (u) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For raisin diversion programs applicable to the 2003 and subsequent crop years, the following provisions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The announced date shall be not later than May 1. The diversion certificates will be issued only for the production units from which vines are removed. The total tonnage available to such applicants shall not exceed the tonnage determined by deducting the tonnage approved for applications received on or before December 20 from the total tonnage announced as eligible by the Committee for diversion: Provided, That, for the 2003 diversion program, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year. Applications shall be considered and approved on a first-come, first-served, basis and shall not be given preference over the tonnage approved for applications received on or before December 20: Provided, That, for the 2003 diversion program, this date may be extended by the Committee to a later date within the 2002-03 crop year. The vines shall be removed from the production units for which such applications are approved not later than June 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Producers who agree to remove the vines pursuant to this paragraph shall notify the Committee in advance of the date when such vines will be removed in order to allow a representative of the Committee to observe and verify such vine removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 989.56(a), the production cap for the 2003 raisin diversion program for the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless varietal type is 2.0 tons of raisins per acre.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Additional opportunity for producers to participate in the 2002 raisin diversion program. An additional opportunity for vine removal of 2002 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins provided for 25,000 additional tons of raisins in accordance with the following provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The additional opportunity applies to production units on which producers agree to remove vines. The additional opportunity program applies to ``new participants'' (producers who are not approved participants in the initial 2002 diversion program), and to ``early season spur pruners'' (approved participants in the initial 2002 diversion program who curtailed production by spur pruning their vines). Grafting vines of one varietal type to another varietal type does not constitute removal under the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Priority will be given to ``new participants.'' If the production volume in such applications exceeds 25,000 tons, a lottery will be held to allocate such diversion tonnage among applicants, pursuant to applicable procedures specified in Sec. 989.156(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eligible producers who wish to participate in this program must file

an application with the Committee by July 8, 2002, with appropriate documentation as specified in Sec. 989.156(b). The Committee shall notify the applicant, in writing, as to whether or not the application has been approved. Vines must be removed or chain sawed at the base of the vine by July 31, 2002. Committee staff will verify that the vines have been removed or adequately chain sawed. Committee staff will re-inspect vines that have been chain sawed to ensure that the remainder of the vine is removed. Procedures specified Sec. Sec. 989.156(e), (f), (g), and (i) through (r) are applicable to the additional opportunity program for vine removal of 2002 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins.
