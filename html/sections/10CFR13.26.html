                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise provided by order, all filings must  be made as electronic submissions in a manner that enables the NRC to  receive, read, authenticate, distribute, and archive the submission, and  process and retrieve it a single page at a time. Detailed guidance on  making electronic submissions may be found in the E-Filing Guidance and  on the NRC Web site at http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.  If a filing contains sections of information or electronic formats that  may not be transmitted electronically for security or other reasons,  portions not containing those sections will be transmitted  electronically to the E-Filing system. In addition, optical   storage media (OSM) containing the entire filing must be physically  delivered or mailed. In such cases, the submitter does not need to apply  to the Commission for an exemption to deviate from the requirements in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic transmission exemption. The ALJ may relieve a  participant who is filing electronic documents of the transmission  requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. Such a participant will  file electronic documents by physically delivering or mailing an OSM  containing the documents. The electronic formatting requirement in  paragraph (a) of this section must be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic document exemption. The ALJ may relieve a participant  of both the electronic (computer file) formatting and transmission  requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such a participant  will file paper documents physically or by mail to the Secretary, U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention:  Rulemakings and Adjudications Staff. Filing by mail is complete upon  deposit in the mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requesting an exemption. A participant seeking an exemption  under paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section must submit the  exemption request with its first filing in the proceeding. In the  request, the requestor must show good cause as to why it cannot file  electronically. The filer may not change its formats and delivery  methods for filing until a ruling on the exemption request is issued.  Exemption requests submitted after the first filing in the proceeding  will be granted only if the requestor shows that the interests of  fairness so require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Every pleading and document filed in the proceeding shall  contain a caption setting forth the title of the action, the case number  assigned by the presiding officer, and a designation of the document  (e.g., motion to quash subpoena).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Filing is complete when the filer performs the last act that it  must perform to submit a document, such as hitting the send/submit/ transmit button for an electronic transmission or depositing the  document, in its entirety, in a mailbox.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signatures. The original of each document must be signed by the  participant or its authorized representative, or by an attorney having  authority with respect to it. The document must state the capacity of  the person signing; his or her address, phone number, and e-mail  address; and the date of signature. The signature of a person signing a  pleading or other similar document submitted by a participant is a  representation that the document has been subscribed in the capacity  specified with full authority, that he or she has read it and knows the  contents, that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and  belief the statements made in it are true, and that it is not interposed  for delay. The signature of a person signing an affidavit or similar  document, which should be submitted in accord with the form outlined in  28 U.S.C. 1746, is a representation that, under penalty of perjury, the  document is true and correct to the best of that individual's knowledge  and belief. If a document is not signed, or is signed with intent to  defeat the purpose of this section, it may be struck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An electronic document must be signed using a participant's or a  participant representative's digital ID certificate. Additional  signatures can be added to the electronic document, including to any  affidavits that accompany the document, by a typed-in designation that  indicates the signer understands and acknowledges that he or she is  assenting to the representations in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When signing an electronic document using a digital ID  certificate, the signature page for the electronic document should  contain a typed signature block that includes the phrase ``Signed  (electronically) by'' typed onto the signature line; the name and the  capacity of the person signing; the person's address, phone number, and  e-mail address; and the date of signature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If additional individuals need to sign an electronic document,  including any affidavits that accompany the document, these individuals  must sign by inserting a typed signature block in the electronic  document that includes the phrase ``Executed in Accord with 10 CFR  2.304(d)'' or its equivalent typed on the signature line as well as the   name and the capacity of the person signing; the person's address, phone  number, and e-mail address; and the date of signature to the extent any  of these items are different from the information provided for the  digital ID certificate signer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paper documents must be signed in ink.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service. A participant filing a document with the ALJ shall at  the time of filing, serve a copy of such document on every other  participant. Service upon any participant of any document other than  those required to be served as prescribed in Sec. 13.8 shall be made  electronically to the E-Filing system. When a participant is represented  by a representative, service shall be made upon such representative in  lieu of the actual participant. Upon an order from the ALJ permitting  alternative filing methods under paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this  section, service may be made by physical delivery or mail. As to each  participant that cannot serve electronically, the ALJ shall require  service by the most expeditious means permitted under this paragraph  that are available to the participant, unless the ALJ finds that this  requirement would impose undue burden or expense on the participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise provided in this paragraph, a participant will  serve documents on the other participants by the same method that those  participants filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of  this section will serve the participants in the proceeding that filed  electronically by physically delivering or mailing an OSM containing the  electronic document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> will  serve the other participants in the proceeding by physically delivering  or mailing a paper copy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A certificate of service stating the names and addresses of the  persons served as well as the method and date of service must accompany  any paper served upon participants to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proof of service, which states the name and address of the  person served as well as the method and date of service, may be made as  required by law, by rule, or by order of the Commission.
