                            <p class="depth0">The invalidity of any provision of these bylaws does not affect the  validity of the remaining provisions, and for this purpose these bylaws  are severable. The Board may amend or repeal these bylaws at any special  or regular meeting, provided that each member of the Board has received  a written notice containing a statement of the proposed amendment or  repeal at least 5 days before the meeting. The members of the Board may  waive the 5 days' notice or the operation of any other provision of  these bylaws by unanimous consent, if that action is not prohibited by  law. The Secretary shall submit the text of any amendment to these  bylaws for publication in the Federal Register as soon as practicable  after the amendment is adopted by the Board.</p>
