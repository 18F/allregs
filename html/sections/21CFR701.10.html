                            <p class="depth0">The term principal display panel as it applies to cosmetics in  package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is  most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under  customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display  panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label  information required to be placed thereon   by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring  designs, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal  display panels, information required to be placed on the principal  display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For  the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of  contents of all packages of substantially the same size, the term ``area  of the principal display panel'' means the area of the side or surface  that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side  properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the  product of the height times the width of that side;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40  percent of the product of the height of the container times the  circumference; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of any other shape of container, 40 percent of the  total surface of the container: Provided, however, That where such  container presents an obvious ``principal display panel'' such as the  top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the  entire top surface.  In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops,  bottoms, flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and  necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly  cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on  the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the  circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or  examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.</p>
