                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever it appears to the seizing agency that any seized  property is liable to perish or to waste, or to be greatly reduced in  value during its detention for forfeiture, or that the expense of  keeping the property is or will be disproportionate to its value, the  appropriate official of the seizing agency may order destruction, sale,  or other disposition of such property prior to forfeiture. In addition,  the owner may obtain release of the property by posting a substitute  monetary amount with the seizing agency to be held subject to forfeiture  proceedings in place of the seized property to be released. Upon  approval by the appropriate official of the seizing agency, the property  will be released to the owner after the payment of an amount equal to  the Government appraised value of the property if the property is not  evidence of a violation of law, is not contraband, and has no design or  other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in illegal  activities. This payment must be in the form of a money order, an  official bank check, or a cashier's check made payable to the United  States Marshals Service. A bond in the form of a cashier's check or  official bank check will be considered as paid once the check has been  accepted for payment by the financial institution that issued the check.  If a substitute amount is posted and the property is administratively  forfeited, the seizing agency will forfeit the substitute amount in lieu  of the property. The pre-forfeiture destruction, sale, or other  disposition of seized property pursuant to this section shall not  extinguish any person's rights to the value of the property under  applicable   law. The authority vested in the appropriate official under this  subsection may not be delegated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The seizing agency shall commence forfeiture proceedings,  regardless of the disposition of the property under Sec.  8.14(a). A  person with an interest in the property that was destroyed or otherwise  disposed of under Sec.  8.14(a) may file a claim to contest the  forfeiture of the property or a petition for remission or mitigation of  the forfeiture. No government agent or employee shall be liable for the  destruction or other disposition of property made pursuant to Sec.   8.14(a). The destruction or other disposition of the property pursuant  to this section does not impair in rem jurisdiction.</p>
