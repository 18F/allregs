                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the proposed action may or will result in significant impacts  to the environment, an EIS is prepared to provide more comprehensive  analyses and conclusions about the impacts. Significant impacts of  socioeconomic consequence alone do not merit an EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Significance of impacts is determined by examining both the  context and intensity of the proposed action (40 CFR 1508.27). The  analysis should establish, by resource category, the threshold at which  significance is reached. For example, an action that would violate  existing pollution standards; cause water, air, noise, soil, or  underground pollution; impair visibility for substantial periods; or  cause irreparable harm to animal or plant life could be determined  significant. Significant beneficial effects also occur and must be  addressed, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The proponent should use appropriate methods to identify and  ascertain the ``significance'' of impacts. The use of simple analytical  tools, which are subject to independent peer review, fully documented,  and available to the public, is encouraged. \4\ In particular, where  impacts are unknown or are suspected to be of public interest, public  involvement should be initiated early in the EA (scoping) process. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ EIFS is one such Army system for evaluating regional economic  impacts under NEPA. This system is mandated, as Army policy, for use in  NEPA analyses. Other similar tools may be mandated for use in the Army,  and will be documented in guidance published pursuant to this part. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
