                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each application for a standard design certification will be assigned a docket number. However, to allow a determination as to whether an application is complete and acceptable for docketing, it will be initially treated as a tendered application. A copy of the tendered application will be available for public inspection at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, and/or at the NRC Public Document Room. Generally, the determination on acceptability for docketing will be made within a period of 30 days. The Commission may decide to determine acceptability on the basis of the technical adequacy of the application as well as its completeness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Commission determines that a tendered application is complete and acceptable for docketing, a docket number will be assigned to the application or part thereof, and the applicant will be notified of the determination.
