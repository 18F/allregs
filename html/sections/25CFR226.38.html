                                Sec. 226.38  What commencement money must the lessee pay to the surface owner?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before commencing actual exploration and/or development, the lessee must pay or tender to the surface owner commencement money in the amount of $25 per shot hole for explosive source (for the acquisition of Single Fold (100 per cent Seismic)), or $400 per linear mile for surface source data acquisition. For the purpose of conducting a 3D seismic survey, the lessee must pay commencement money in the amount of $10 per acre occupied during the time the survey is conducted. The lessee must also pay commencement money in the amount of $2500 for each well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After payment of commencement money the lessee will be entitled to immediate possession of the drilling site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commencement money will not be required for the redrilling of a well which was originally drilled under the current lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A drilling site must be held to the minimum area essential for operations and not exceed one and one-half acres in area unless authorized by the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commencement money is a credit toward the settlement of the total damages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acceptance of commencement money by the surface owner does not affect its right to compensation for damages as described in Sec. 226.40, occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which it was paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Since actual damage to the surface from operations cannot necessarily be ascertained prior to the completion of a well as a serviceable well or dry hole, a damage settlement covering the drilling operation need not be made until after completion of drilling operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the surface is restricted land, commencement money must be paid to the Superintendent for the landowner. All other surface owners must be paid or tendered such commencement money directly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where such surface owners are neither residents of Osage County, nor have a representative located therein, such payment must be made or tendered to the last known address of the surface owner at least 5 calendar days before commencing drilling operation on any well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the lessee is unable to reach the owner of the surface of the land for the purpose of tendering the commencement money or if the owner of the surface of the land refuses to accept the same, the lessee must deposit such amount with the Superintendent by check payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Superintendent must thereupon advise the owner of the surface of the land by mail at his/her last known address that the commencement money is being held for payment to him upon his/her written request.</p>
