However, the Federal share of the cost of the contract cannot exceed 50 percent unless a variance has been granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recommended variances exceeding the 50 percent level must be in the public interest and based on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The main benefits to be derived from measures are related to improving offsite water quality, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The matching share requirements would place a burden on the landowner or operator which would probably prevent him or her from participating in the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> BMP's to be cost shared must have a positive effect on water quality by reducing the amount of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants that enter a stream or lake.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cost sharing is not to be made available for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measures installed primarily for bringing additional land into crop production, including but not limited to land clearing and brush removal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measures installed primarily for increasing production on existing cropland, including but not limited to bedding, field ditches, open drains, and tile drains;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measures having flood protection as the primary purpose, including but not limited to open channels, clearing and snagging, and obstruction removal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Structural measures authorized for installation under Pub.
