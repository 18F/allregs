                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What they are. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The inpatient deductible and coinsurance  amounts are portions of the cost of covered hospital or CAH or SNF  services that Medicare does not pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hospital or CAH or SNF may charge these amounts to the  beneficiary or someone on his or her behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in the inpatient deductible and coinsurance amounts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  The law requires the Secretary to adjust the inpatient hospital  deductible each year to reflect changes in the average cost of hospital  care. In adjusting the deductible, the Secretary must use a formula  specified in section 1813(b)(2) of the Act. Under that formula, the  inpatient hospital deductible is increased each year by about the same  percentage as the increase in the average Medicare daily hospital costs.  The result of the deductible increase is that the beneficiary continues  to pay about the same proportion of the hospital bill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Since the coinsurance amounts are, by statute, specific  fractions of the deductible, they change when the deductible changes.
