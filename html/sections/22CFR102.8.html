                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To airline and Civil Aeronautics Administration representatives. If a scheduled United States air carrier is involved the airline representatives concerned will probably be the first to be informed of the accident, in which event he will be expected to report the accident to the Foreign Service post, to the nearest Civil Aeronautics Administration office, and to his home office in the United States. If this is not the case, the Foreign Service post should report promptly to the nearest office of the airline concerned and to the nearest office of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, any accident occurring to a scheduled civil air carrier of United States registry within its consular district. To be properly prepared, each post should obtain and have on file for ready reference, the address and telephone number of representatives of any United States airline engaged in scheduled operations within or over the post district.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To Department and supervisory Foreign Service offices. A Foreign Service post should report promptly to the Department accidents to any United States civil aircraft occurring in the post district. The report should summarize all available information and, in the case of a scheduled United States air carrier, should state whether the airline has taken over the responsibility of notifying the nearest Civil Aeronautics Administration field office. This report should be submitted by the most expeditious means possible (priority telephone or telegraph message) at Government expense. If the accident involves a private plane or non-scheduled air carrier, these circumstances should be reported, also whether the nearest office of the Civil Aeronautics Administration has been informed. In the latter case, the Department will ascertain from the Civil Aeronautics Board whether it desires to investigate the case, and inform the Foreign Service post accordingly. Consular posts should submit a similar report to their supervisory missions or to their supervisory consular offices in territories where there are no United States missions. Supplementary reports should be supplied the Department and the supervisory Foreign Service office whenever considered appropriate. A final report, after the urgency has diminished, and when the post's role is negligible should cover the post's activities in connection with the accident (see Sec. 102.16(b)).</p>
