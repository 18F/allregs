                                Sec. 1.994-1  Inter-company pricing rules for DISC's.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Scope. In the case of a transaction described in  paragraph (b) of this section, section 994 permits a person related to a  DISC to determine the allowable transfer price charged the DISC (or  commission paid the DISC) by its choice of three methods described in  paragraph (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section: The ``4 percent'' gross  receipts method, the ``50-50'' combined taxable income method, and the  section 482 method. Under the first two methods, the DISC is entitled to  10 percent of its export promotion expenses as additional taxable  income. When the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method  is applied to a transaction, the Commissioner may not make  distributions, apportionments, or allocations as provided by section 482  and the regulations thereunder. For rules as to certain ``incomplete  transactions'' and for computing combined taxable income, see paragraph  (c)(5) and (6) of this section. Grouping of transactions for purposes of  applying the method chosen is provided by paragraph (c)(7) of this  section. The rules in paragraph (c) of this section are directly  applicable only in the case of sales or exchanges of export property to  a DISC for resale, and are applicable by analogy to leases, commissions,  and services as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. For rules  limiting the application of the gross receipts method and combined  taxable income method so that the supplier related to the DISC will not  incur a loss on transactions, see paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section.  Paragraph (e)(2) of this section provides for the applicability of  section 482 to resales by the DISC to related persons. Paragraph (e)(3)  of this section provides for the time by which a reasonable estimate of  the transfer price (including commissions and other payments) should be  paid. The subsequent determination and further adjustments to transfer  prices are set forth in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Export  promotion expenses are defined in paragraph (f) of this section.  Paragraph (g) of this section has several examples illustrating the  provisions of this section. Section 1.994-2 prescribes the marginal  costing rules authorized by section 994(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> does not depend on the extent to which the  DISC performs substantial economic functions (except with respect to  export promotion expenses). See paragraph (l) of Sec. 1.993-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Related party and related supplier. For the purposes of this  section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term ``related party'' means a person which is owned or  controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the DISC  within the meaning of section 482 and Sec. 1.482-1(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``related supplier'' means a related party which  singly engages in a transaction directly with the DISC which is subject  to the rules of section 994 and this section. However, a DISC may have  different related suppliers with respect to different transactions. If,  for example, X owns all the stock of Y, a corporation, and of Z, a DISC,  and sells a product to Y which is resold to Z, only Y is the related  supplier of Z, and, thus, only the resale from Y to Z is subject to  section 994 and this section. If, however, X sells directly to Z and Y  also sells directly to Z, then, as to the transactions involving direct  sales to Z, each of X and Y is a related supplier of Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transactions to which section 994 applies. Section 994(a)(3) may  be applied, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, to any  transaction between a related supplier and a DISC. Section 994(a)(1) or  (2) may be applied, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, to a  transaction between a related supplier and a DISC only in the following  cases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the related supplier sells export property to the DISC for  resale or where the DISC is commission agent for the related supplier on  sales by the related supplier of export property to third parties  whether or not related parties. For purposes of this section, references  to sales include exchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the related supplier leases export property to the DISC  for sublease for a comparable period with comparable terms of payment or  where the DISC is commission agent for the related supplier on leases by  the related supplier of export property to third parties whether or not  related parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where services are furnished by a related supplier which are  related and subsidiary to any sale or lease by the DISC, acting as  principal or commission agent, of export property under subparagraph (1)  or (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where engineering or architectural services for construction  projects located (or proposed for location) outside of the United States  are furnished by a related supplier where the DISC is acting as  principal or commission agent with respect to the furnishing of such  services to a third party whether or not a related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> of this paragraph,  the rules of section 994(a)(1) or (2) do not apply. Thus, for example,  the rules of section 994(a)(1) or (2) would not apply if a DISC  purchased export property from its related supplier and leased such  property to a third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfer price for sales of export property--(1) In general.  Under this paragraph, rules are prescribed for computing the allowable  price for a transfer from a related supplier to a DISC in the case of a  sale of export property described in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ``4-percent'' gross receipts method. Under the gross  receipts method of pricing, the transfer price for a sale by the related  supplier to the DISC is the price as a result of which the taxable  income derived by the DISC from the sale will not exceed the sum of (i)  4 percent of the qualified export receipts of the DISC derived from the  sale of the export property (as defined in section 993 (c)) and (ii) 10  percent of the export promotion expenses (as defined in paragraph (f) of  this section) of the DISC attributable to such qualified export  receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The ``50-50'' combined taxable income method. Under the combined  taxable income method of pricing, the transfer price for a sale by the  related supplier to the DISC is the price as a result of which the  taxable income derived by the DISC from the sale will not exceed the sum  of (i) 50 percent of   the combined taxable income (as defined in subparagraph (6) of this  paragraph) of the DISC and its related supplier attributable to the  qualified export receipts from such sale and (ii) 10 percent of the  export promotion expenses (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section)  of the DISC attributable to such qualified export receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 482 method. If the rules of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of  this paragraph are inapplicable to a sale or a taxpayer does not choose  to use them, the transfer price for a sale by the related supplier to  the DISC is to be determined on the basis of the sale price actually  charged but subject to the rules provided by section 482 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Incomplete transactions. (i) For purposes of the gross receipts  and combined taxable income methods, where property (encompassed within  a transaction or group chosen under subparagraph (7) of this paragraph)  is transferred by a related supplier to a DISC during a taxable year of  either the DISC or related supplier, but some or all of such property is  not sold by the DISC during such year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The transfer price of such property sold by the DISC during such  year shall be computed separately from the transfer price of the  property not sold by the DISC during such year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With respect to such property not sold by the DISC during such  year, the transfer price paid by the DISC for such year shall be the  related supplier's cost of goods sold (see subparagraph (6)(ii) of this  paragraph) with respect to the property, except that, with respect to  such taxable years ending on or before August 15, 1975, the transfer  price paid by the DISC shall be at least (but need not exceed) the  related supplier's cost of goods sold with respect to the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For the subsequent taxable year during which such property is  resold by the DISC, an additional amount shall be paid by the DISC (to  be treated as income for such year by the related supplier) equal to the  excess of the amount which would have been the transfer price under this  section had the transfer to the DISC by the related supplier and the  resale by the DISC taken place during the taxable year of the DISC  during which it resold the property over the amount already paid under  (b) of this subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The time and manner of payment of transfer prices required by  (b) and (c) of this subdivision shall be determined under paragraphs  (e)(3), (4), and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Combined taxable income. For purposes of this section, the  combined taxable income of a DISC and its related supplier from a sale  of export property is the excess of the gross receipts (as defined in  section 993(f)) of the DISC from such sale over the total costs of the  DISC and related supplier which relate to such gross receipts. Gross  receipts from a sale do not include interest with respect to the sale.  Combined taxable income under this paragraph shall be determined after  taking into account under paragraph (e)(2) of this section all  adjustments required by section 482 with respect to transactions to  which such section is applicable. In determining the gross receipts of  the DISC and the total costs of the DISC and related supplier which  relate to such gross receipts, the following rules shall be applied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to subdivisions (ii) through (v) of this subparagraph,  the taxpayer's method of accounting used in computing taxable income  will be accepted for purposes of determining amounts and the taxable  year for which items of income and expense (including depreciation) are  taken into account. See Sec. 1.991-1(b)(2) with respect   to the method of accounting which may be used by a DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost of goods sold shall be determined in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1.61-3. See sections 471 and 472 and the regulations  thereunder with respect to inventories. With respect to property to  which an election under section 631 applies (relating to cutting of  timber considered as a sale or exchange), cost of goods sold shall be  determined by applying Sec. 1.631-1(d)(3) and (e) (relating to fair  market value as of the beginning of the taxable year of the standing  timber cut during the year considered as its cost).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Costs (other than cost of goods sold) which shall be treated  as relating to gross receipts from sales of export property are (a) the  expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related, and therefore  allocated and apportioned, thereto, and (b) a ratable part of any other  expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely related  to a class of gross income, determined in a manner consistent with the  rules set forth in Sec. 1.861-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The taxpayer's choice in accordance with subparagraph (7) of  this paragraph as to the grouping of transactions shall be controlling,  and costs deductible in a taxable year shall be allocated and  apportioned to the items or classes of gross income of such taxable year  resulting from such grouping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If an account receivable arising with respect to a sale of  export property is transferred by the related supplier to a DISC which  is a member of the same controlled group within the meaning of  Sec. 1.993-1(k) for an amount reflecting a discount from the selling  price taken into account in computing (without regard to this  subdivision) combined taxable income of the DISC and its related  supplier, then the combined taxable income from such sale shall be  reduced by the amount of the discount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Grouping transactions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally, the determinations under  this section are to be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.  However, at the annual choice of the taxpayer some or all of these  determinations may be made on the basis of groups consisting of products  or product lines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A determination by a taxpayer as to a product or a product line  will be accepted by a district director if such determination conforms  to any one of the following standards: (a) A recognized industry or  trade usage, or (b) the 2-digit major groups (or any inferior  classifications or combinations thereof, within a major group) of the  Standard Industrial Classification as prepared by the Statistical Policy  Division of the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the  President.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A choice by the taxpayer to group transactions for a taxable  year on a product or product line basis shall apply to all transactions  with respect to that product or product line consummated during the  taxable year. However, the choice of a product or product line grouping  applies only to transactions covered by the grouping and, as to  transactions not encompassed by the grouping, the determinations are  made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For example, the taxpayer  may choose a product grouping with respect to one product and use the  transaction-by-transaction method for another product within the same  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For rules as to grouping certain related and subsidiary  services, see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules under section 994(a)(1) and (2) for transactions other  than sales. The following rules are prescribed for purposes of applying  the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method to  transactions other than sales:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Leases. In the case of a lease of export property by a related  supplier to a DISC for sublease by the DISC to produce gross receipts,  for any taxable year the amount of rent the DISC must pay to the related  supplier shall be determined under the DISC's lease with its related  supplier but must be computed in a manner consistent with the rules in  paragraph (c) of this section for computing the transfer price in the  case of sales and resales of export property under the gross receipts  method or combined taxable income method. For purposes of applying this  subparagraph, transactions may not be so grouped on a product or product  line basis under the rules of paragraph (c)(7)   of this section as to combine in any one group of transactions both  lease transactions and sale transactions involving the same product or  product line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commissions. If any transaction to which section 994 applies is  handled on a commission basis for a related supplier by a DISC and such  commissions give rise to qualified export receipts under section  993(a)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the income that may be earned by the DISC in any  year is the amount, computed in a manner consistent with paragraph (c)  of this section, which the DISC would have been permitted to earn under  the gross receipts method, the combined taxable income method, or  section 482 method if the related supplier had sold (or leased) the  property or service to the DISC and the DISC in turn sold (or subleased)  to a third party, whether or not a related party, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum commission the DISC may charge the related supplier  is the sum of the amount of income determined under subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph plus the DISC's total costs for the transaction as  determined under paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Receipts from services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Related and subsidiary services  attributable to the year of the export transaction. The gross receipts  for related and subsidiary services described in paragraph (b)(3) of  this section shall be treated as part of the receipts from the export  transaction to which such services are related and subsidiary, but only  if, under the arrangement between the DISC and its related supplier and  the accounting method otherwise employed by the DISC, the income from  such services is includible for the same taxable year as income from  such export transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other services. In the case of related and subsidiary services  to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply and other  services described in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section performed  by a related supplier (relating respectively to engineering and  architectural services and certain managerial services), the amount of  taxable income which the DISC may derive for any taxable year shall be  determined under the arrangement between the DISC and its related  supplier and shall be computed in a manner consistent with the rules in  paragraph (c) of this section for computing the transfer price in the  case of sales for resale of export property under the gross receipts  method or combined taxable income method. Related and subsidiary  services to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply  may be grouped, under the rules for grouping of transactions in  paragraph (c)(7) of this section, with the products or product lines to  which they are related and subsidiary, so long as the grouping of  services chosen is consistent with the grouping of products or product  lines chosen for the taxable year in which either the product or product  lines were sold or in which payment for such services is received or  accrued. The rules for grouping of transactions in paragraph (c)(7) of  this section shall not apply with respect to the determination of  taxable income which the DISC may derive from other services described  in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section performed by a related  supplier or commissions on such services, and such determination shall  be made only on a transaction-by-transaction basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Methods of applying paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Limitation on DISC income (``no loss'' rule)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in this subparagraph, neither the gross receipts  method nor the combined taxable income method may be applied to cause in  any taxable year a loss to the related supplier, but either method may  be applied to the extent it does not cause a loss. A loss to a related  supplier would result if the taxable income of the DISC would exceed the  combined taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC. If,  however, there is no combined taxable income of the DISC and the related  supplier (because, for example, a combined loss is incurred), a transfer  price (or commission) will not be deemed to cause a loss to the related  supplier if it allows the DISC to recover an amount not in excess of its  costs (if any).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for applying ``4 percent'' gross receipts method  to sales. A   transfer price or commission, determined under the ``4 percent'' gross  receipts method (determined without regard to subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph), for a sale of export property referred to in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, will not be considered to cause a loss for the  related supplier if for the DISC's taxable year, the ratio that (a) the  taxable income of the DISC derived from such sale by using such price or  commission bears to (b) the DISC's gross receipts from such sale is not  greater than the ratio that (c) all of the taxable income of the related  supplier and the DISC from all sales of the same product or product line  (domestic and foreign) to third parties whether or not related parties  bears to (d) the total gross receipts of the related supplier and the  DISC from such sales. For purposes of the preceding sentence, sales  between the DISC and its related suppliers shall not be taken into  account under (c) or (d) of this subdivision. For example, assume that  for a taxable year of a DISC the total costs of the related supplier and  the DISC with respect to all sales ($150 for domestic and $44 for  foreign) of a product line are $194 and the total gross receipts of the  related supplier and the DISC with respect to such sales are $200 so  that the total taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC with  respect to such sales is $6. The parties would thus be entitled to  compute a transfer price determined under the gross receipts method on  any given sale of product A of such product line by the related supplier  to the DISC which would allocate to the DISC taxable income equal to not  more than 3 percent (i.e., $6/$200) of its gross receipts derived from  its resale of such product. If the DISC were to resell an item of  product A for $10, the transfer price paid by the DISC to the related  supplier determined under the gross receipts method could be as low as  $9.70.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Grouping transactions. For purposes of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph, the basis for grouping transactions chosen by the taxpayer  under paragraph (c)(7) of this section for the taxable year shall be  applied. For purposes of making the computations of subdivision (ii) (c)  and (d) of this subparagraph, however, the taxpayer may choose any basis  for grouping transactions permissible under paragraph (c)(7) of this  section, even though it may not be the same basis as that already chosen  under paragraph (c)(7) of this section for computing transfer prices or  commissions to a DISC. If, for example, the taxpayer has chosen to group  transactions on a product basis for computing transfer prices or  commissions to a DISC for a taxable year, the taxpayer may still group  transactions on a product line basis for purposes of computing taxable  income and total gross receipts under subdivision (ii) (c) and (d) of  this subparagraph. For a further example, if the taxpayer computes  taxable income for one group of transactions under the gross receipts  method and computes taxable income for a second group of transactions  under the combined taxable income method, the taxpayer may aggregate  these transactions for purposes of computing taxable income and total  gross receipts under subdivision (ii) (c) and (d) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relationship to section 482. In applying the rules under section  994, it may be necessary to first take into account the price of a  transfer (or other transaction) between the DISC (or related supplier)  and a related party which is subject to the arm's length standard of  section 482. Thus, for example, where a related supplier sells export  property to a DISC which the related supplier purchased from related  parties, the costs taken into account in computing the combined taxable  income of the DISC and the related supplier are determined after any  necessary adjustment under section 482 of the price paid by the related  supplier to the related parties. In applying section 482 to a transfer  by a DISC, however, the DISC and its related supplier are treated as if  they were a single entity carrying on all the functions performed by the  DISC and the related supplier with respect to the transaction and the  DISC shall be allowed to receive under the section 482 standard the  amount the related supplier would have received had there been no DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Initial payment of transfer price or commission. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount  of a transfer price (or reasonable estimate thereof) actually charged by  a related supplier   to a DISC, or a sales commission (or reasonable estimate thereof)  actually charged by a DISC to a related supplier, in a transaction to  which section 994 applies must be paid no later than 60 days following  the close of the taxable year of the DISC during which the transaction  occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, or an accounting entry offsetting the account  receivable against an existing debt owed by the person in whose favor  the account receivable was established to the person with whom it  engaged in the transaction. The form of the payment to a DISC need not  be a qualified export asset under Sec. 1.993-2. However, for the  requirement that the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets of  the DISC at the close of its taxable year must equal or exceed 95  percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets of the DISC at  the close of its taxable year, see section 992(a)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the district director can demonstrate, based upon the data  available as of the 60th day after the close of such taxable year, that  the amount actually paid did not represent a reasonable estimate of the  transfer price or commission (as the case may be) to be determined under  section 994 and this section, an indebtedness will be deemed to arise,  from the person required to make the payment in favor of the person to  whom the payment is required to be made, in an amount equal to the  difference between the amount of the transfer price or commission  determined under section 994 and this section and the amount (if any)  actually paid and received. Such indebtedness will be deemed to arise as  of the date the transaction occurred which gave rise to the  indebtedness, except that, if such transaction occurred in a taxable  year of the DISC ending on or before August 15, 1975, at the taxpayer's  option, the indebtedness will be deemed to arise as of the date by which  payment was required under subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(3).  Such indebtedness owed to a DISC shall be treated as an asset but shall  not be treated as a trade receivable or other qualified export asset  (see Sec. 1.993-2(d)(3)) as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC  in which the indebtedness is deemed to arise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(a)</em> Except with respect to incomplete transactions to which  paragraph (c)(5)(i)(b) of this section applies, if the amount actually  paid results in the DISC realizing at least 50 percent of the DISC's  taxable income from the transaction as reported in its tax return for  the taxable year the transaction is completed, then the amount actually  paid shall be deemed to be a reasonable estimate of such transfer price  or commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this section applies and which were initiated during a  taxable year ending after August 15, 1975, the amount actually paid  shall be deemed to be a reasonable estimate of such transfer price if  any one of the following three tests is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier in  respect of the property does not exceed the related supplier's cost of  goods sold (see paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section) with respect to  the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the transaction is completed by the date on which the DISC's  return is required to be filed for the year in which the transaction was  initiated, the amount actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier  in respect of the property results in the DISC realizing at least 50  percent of the DISC's taxable income from the transaction when  completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The percentage that (i) an amount equal to (a) the amount  actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier in respect of the  property minus (b) the related supplier's cost of goods sold with  respect to the property, bears to (ii) the related supplier's cost of  goods sold in respect of the property, is not greater than 50 percent of  the percentage that (iii) the combined taxable income for completed  transactions of the same group as the property during the DISC's taxable  year in which the incomplete transaction was initiated, bears to (iv)  the cost of goods sold of the related supplier and DISC with respect to  such transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(5)</em> and (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An indebtedness arising under subdivision (iii) of this  subparagraph shall bear interest at an arm's length rate, computed in  the manner provided by Sec. 1.482-2(a)(2) from the 61st day after the  close of the DISC's taxable year in which the transaction occurred which  gave rise to the indebtedness to the date of payment. The interest so  computed shall be accrued and included in the taxable income of the  person to whom the indebtedness is owed for each taxable year during  which the indebtedness is unpaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subsequent determination of transfer price or commission. The  DISC and its related supplier would ordinarily determine under section  994 and this section the transfer price payable by the DISC (or the  commission payable to the DISC) for a transaction before the DISC files  its return for the taxable year of the transaction. After the DISC has  filed its return, a redetermination of the transfer price (or  commission) may only be made if permitted by the Code and the  regulations thereunder. Such a redetermination would include a  redetermination by reason of an adjustment under section 482 and the  regulations thereunder or section 861 and Sec. 1.861-8 which affects the  amounts which entered into the determination of the transfer price or  commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedure for adjustments to transfer price or commission-- (i)(a) If the transfer price (or commission) for a transaction  determined under section 994 is different from the price (or commission)  actually charged, the person who received too small a transfer price (or  commission) or paid too large a transfer price (or commission) shall  establish (or be deemed to have established), at the date of the  determination or redetermination under subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph of the transfer price (or commission) under section 994, an  account receivable due the DISC from the person with whom it engaged in  the transaction equal to the difference in amount between the transfer  price (or commission) so determined and the transfer price (or  commission) previously paid and received. If the account receivable is  paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or deemed  established), then as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in  which the transaction occurred which gave rise to the indebtedness, the  account receivable shall be treated as an asset and, under Sec. 1.993- 2(d)(3) as a trade receivable, and thus as a qualified export asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If, for example, during 1972, a DISC which uses the calendar  year as its taxable year sold a product which it purchased that year  from its related supplier and paid a price of $10,000 which price is a  reasonable estimate under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph but is  later determined under section 994 to be $8,000 immediately before the  DISC filed its return for 1972, the DISC must be paid $2,000 (i.e.,  $10,000-$8,000) by its related supplier or establish an account  receivable from its related supplier of $2,000. The account receivable  may be paid without tax consequences, provided that such account  receivable is paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or  deemed established). Such account receivable paid within such 90 days  will be considered to relate to the taxable year in which the  transaction occurred which gave rise thereto rather than the taxable  year during which it is established or paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment must be in a form specified in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an account receivable of a DISC described in subdivision  (i) of this paragraph (e)(5) is not paid within 90 days of the date it  is established (or deemed established), then, as of the end of the  taxable year of the DISC in which the transaction occurred which gives  rise to the indebtedness, the account receivable shall be treated as an  asset except that, if the account receivable is established (or deemed  established) in a taxable year of the DISC ending on or before August  15, 1975, at the taxpayer's option, the account receivable shall be  treated as an asset as of the end of such taxable year. However, under  Sec. 1.993-2(d)(3), an account receivable referred to in the preceding   sentence shall not be treated as a trade receivable or other qualified  export asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An account receivable established in accordance with  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall bear interest at an arm's  length rate, computed in the manner provided by Sec. 1.482-2(a)(2) from  the day after the date the account receivable is deemed established to  the date of payment. The interest so computed shall be accrued and  included in the taxpayer's taxable income for each taxable year during  which the account receivable is outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>  shall apply to all open taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If, for example, during 1982, a DISC commission from a related  supplier with respect to a transaction completed in 1980 was  redetermined to be $1,000 less than the commission actually charged by,  and paid to, the DISC, the amount of any distribution previously made by  the DISC from its 1980 previously taxed income to the related supplies  as a shareholder may, to the extent of $1,000, be treated not as a  distribution but as a repayment of the commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The procedure for adjustments to transfer price provided by  this subparagraph does not apply to incomplete transactions described in  paragraph (c)(5)(i)(b) of this section. Such procedure will, however, be  applied to any such transaction with respect to the taxable year in  which the transaction is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During 1975, a DISC which uses the calendar year as  its taxable year purchased a product from its related supplier and made  an initial payment of $8,500. If $8,500 were determined to be the  transfer price under section 994, the DISC's taxable income from the  transaction would be $1,000. Immediately before the DISC filed its  return for 1975, under section 994 it is determined that the transfer  price is $8,000 and the DISC's taxable income is $1,500. Thus, the  requirement of a reasonable estimate under subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph was met because the amount ($8,500) actually paid resulted in  the DISC realizing taxable income of $1,000 which is not less than 50  percent of the DISC's taxable income ($1,500) from the transaction as  determined under section 994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, an account  receivable due the DISC for $500, i.e., $8,500-$8,000, is established on  September 15, 1976, the date the DISC files its return for 1975, and is  paid on December 1, 1976. The account receivable for $500 will be  considered to relate to the taxable year (1975) in which the transaction  occurred which gave rise thereto and will be a qualified export asset  under Sec. 1.993-2(d)(3) for the last day of such year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the  account receivable for $500 is paid on January 1, 1977. The account  receivable for $500 will still be considered to relate to the taxable  year (1975) in which the transaction occurred which gave rise thereto.  However, such account receivable will be treated as an asset which is  not   a qualified export asset under Sec. 1.993-2(d)(3) for the last day of  such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Export promotion expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose of expense. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order  for an expense or cost of a type described in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph to be an export promotion expense, the expense or cost must be  incurred or treated as incurred by the DISC (under subparagraph (7) of  this paragraph) to advance the sale, lease, or other distribution of  export property for use, consumption, or distribution outside the United  States. Costs of services in performing installation (but not assembly)  on the site and for meeting warranty commitments if such services are  related and subsidiary (within the meaning of Sec. 1.993-1(d)) to any  qualified sale, lease, or other distribution of export property by the  DISC (or with respect to which the DISC received a commission) will be  considered to advance the sale, lease, or other distribution of export  property. General and administrative expenses attributable to billing  customers, other clerical functions of the DISC, or generally operating  the DISC, will also be considered to advance the sale, lease, or other  distribution of export property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where an expense or cost incurred or treated as incurred by the  DISC qualifies only in part as an export promotion expense, such expense  or cost must be allocated between the qualified portion and such other  portion on a reasonable basis. See Sec. 1.994-2(b)(2) for the option of  the related supplier not to claim expenses as export promotion expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Types of expenses. The only expenses or costs which may be  export promotion expenses are those expenses or costs meeting the test  of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which constitute--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ordinary and necessary expenses of the DISC paid or incurred  during the DISC's taxable year in carrying on any trade or business,  allowable as deductions under section 162, such as expenses for market  studies, advertising, salaries and wages (including contributions or  compensations deductible under section 404) of sales, clerical, and  other personnel, rentals on property, sales commissions, warehousing,  and other selling expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonable allowance under section 167 for exhaustion, wear  and tear, or obsolescence of the property of the DISC,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Costs of freight (subject to the limitations of subparagraph  (4) of this paragraph),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Costs of packaging for export (as defined in subparagraph (5)  of this paragraph), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Costs of designing and labeling packages exclusively for export  markets (under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ineligible expenses. Items ineligible to be export promotion  expenses include, for example, interest expenses, bad debt expenses,  freight insurance, State and local income and franchise taxes, the cost  of manufacture or assembly operations, and items of cost of goods sold  (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph in the case of certain  freight, packaging, and designing and labeling expenses). Income or  similar taxes eligible for a foreign tax credit under sections 901 and  903 are also not eligible to be export promotion expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Freight expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Export promotion expenses  include one-half of the freight expense (not including insurance) for  shipping export property aboard a U.S.-flag carrier in those cases where  law or regulation of the United States or of any State or political  subdivision thereof or of any agency or instrumentality of any of these  does not require that the export property be shipped aboard a U.S.-flag  carrier. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``freight expense''  includes charges paid for c.o.d. service, miscellaneous ground charges,  such as charges incurred for services normally performed by U.S.-flag  carriers, charges for services of loading aboard U.S.-flag carriers  normally performed by such carriers, freight forwarders, or independent  contractors engaged in loading property, and charges attributable to a  freight consolidation function normally performed by freight forwarders.  In order for one-half of freight expenses paid to the owner (or the  agent of the owner) of a U.S.-flag carrier to be claimed as an export  promotion expense, the DISC must obtain   a written statement (such as, for example, a bill of lading) from the  owner (or the agent) disclosing that the export property was shipped  aboard the owner's U.S.-flag carrier or another U.S.-flag carrier, and  the DISC must have no reasonable basis for disbelieving such statement  of the owner (or the agent). For the requirement of a written statement  from a freight forwarder, see subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S.-flag carrier defined. For purposes of this paragraph, the  term ``U.S.-flag carrier'' is an airplane owned and operated by a U.S.  person or persons (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) or a ship  documented under the laws of the United States. Shipment initiated by  delivery to the U.S. Postal Service shall be considered shipment aboard  a U.S.-flag carrier, but not if shipped to a place to which mail  shipments from the United States are ordinarily accomplished by land  transportation, such as to Canada or Mexico, unless airmail is  specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Shipment pursuant to law or regulation. Shipment pursuant to  law or regulation includes instances where a U.S.-flag carrier must be  used in order to obtain permission from the Government to make the  export. If the law or regulation requires a fixed portion of the export  property to be shipped aboard a U.S.-flag carrier, the freight expense  on that portion of such export property that was so shipped in order to  satisfy such requirement cannot qualify as an export promotion expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Freight forwarders. A payment to a freight forwarder shall be  considered freight expense within the meaning of this paragraph to the  extent the forwarder utilizes a U.S.-flag carrier. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term ``freight forwarder'' includes air freight  consolidators and carriers owned and operated by U.S. persons utilizing  U.S.- flag carriers such as non-vessel-owning common carriers. In order  for one-half of freight expenses paid to a freight forwarder to be  claimed as export promotion expenses, the DISC must obtain a written  statement (such as, for example, a bill of lading) from the freight  forwarder disclosing that the export property was shipped aboard a U.S.- flag carrier, and the DISC must have no reasonable basis for  disbelieving such statement of the freight forwarder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Freight within the United States. A DISC may not claim as export  promotion expense any amount that is attributable to carriage of export  property between points within the United States. If, however, export  property is carried from the United States to a foreign country on a  through shipment pursuant to a single bill of lading or similar document  aboard one or more U.S.-flag carriers, the freight expense of such  carriage shall not be apportioned between the domestic and foreign  portions of such carriage, even though a carrier may stop en route  within the United States or the export property may be shifted from one  carrier to another, and one-half of such freight expense may be claimed  as an export promotion expense. Freight expense does not include the  cost of transporting the export property to the depot of the U.S.-flag  carrier or freight forwarder for shipment abroad. The expense of  shipment of export property initiated by delivery to the U.S. Postal  Service for ultimate delivery outside the United States shall be  considered as attributable entirely to carriage of such property outside  the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Packaging for export. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Export promotion expenses include the  direct and indirect cost of packaging export property (including the  cost of the package) for export whether or not the packaging is the same  as domestic packaging. Such packaging costs do not include costs of  manufacturing (as defined in the regulations under section 993) and  assembly. Thus, if a DISC buys and packages export property for resale,  its costs of packaging the export property are export promotion  expenses. If, however, the process of such packaging by the DISC is  physically integrated with the process of manufacturing the export  property by the related supplier, the costs of such packaging are not  export promotion expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of containers leased from a shipping company to which  the DISC also pays freight for the property packaged is not a cost of  packaging. However, in such circumstances, one-   half of the rental charge may be allowable as a freight expense if  permitted under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Designing and labeling packages. Export promotion expenses  include the direct and indirect costs of designing and labeling  packages, including bottles, cans, jars, boxes, cartons, or containers,  to the extent incurred for export markets. Thus, for example, to the  extent incurred for supplying export markets, the cost of designing  labels in a foreign language and the cost of printing such labels are  export promotion expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> DISC must incur export promotion expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In  order for an expense to be an export promotion expense it must be  incurred or treated as incurred under this subparagraph by the DISC. For  example, an expense is incurred by a DISC if the expense results from  (a) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay compensation to its  employees, (b) depreciation of property owned by the DISC and used by  its employees, (c) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay for office  supplies used by its employees, (d) the DISC incurring an obligation to  pay space costs for use by its employees, or (e) the DISC incurring an  obligation to pay other costs supporting efforts by its employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments to independent contractors. A payment to an  independent contractor, directly or indirectly, is treated as incurred  by the DISC if the cost of performing the function performed by the  independent contractor would be considered an export promotion expense  described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph if performed by  the DISC, and if, in a case where the services of the independent  contractor were engaged by a party related to the DISC, such related  party and such DISC agreed in writing before the contract was entered  into that a specified portion or all of the contract was for the benefit  of the DISC and that all of the expenses of the contract (eligible to be  considered as export promotion expenses) with respect to such portion  would be borne by the DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Expenses incurred by related parties. Reimbursements or other  payments by a DISC to a related party are export promotion expenses only  if the expenses of the related party for which reimbursement is made are  for space in a building actually used by employees of the DISC or for  export property owned by the DISC. Except as otherwise provided in the  preceding sentence, expenses incurred by a foreign international sales  corporation (FISC) or a real property holding company (as defined in  section 993(e)(1) and (2), respectively) shall not be treated as export  promotion expenses of its DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Selling commissions paid by a DISC. A commission paid by a DISC  to a person other than a related person, with respect to a transaction  which gives rise to qualified export receipts of the DISC, is an export  promotion expense of the DISC. A commission paid by a DISC to a related  person is not an export promotion expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sales of promotional material. If a DISC sells promotional  material to a buyer of export property from the DISC at a price which is  greater than the costs of the DISC for such material, such costs are not  export promotion expenses. If, however, the DISC sells promotional  material at a price which is less than its costs for such material, the  excess of such costs over such price is an export promotion expense. For  rules relating to the status of promotional material as qualified export  assets and export property, see Secs. 1.993-2 and 1.993-3, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> An expense may be incurred by the DISC under subdivisions (i)  through (v) of this subparagraph even if the accounting for and payment  of such expense is handled by a related party and the DISC reimburses  the related party for such expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Incomplete transactions. Expenses eligible to be treated as  export promotion expenses which are attributable to the sale, lease, or  other distribution of export property and which are incurred prior to  the taxable year of sale, lease, or other distribution by the DISC are  not treated as export promotion expenses until the taxable year of sale,  lease, or other distribution or until the taxable year in which it is  first determined that no transaction is reasonably expected to result  from the expense incurred (whether or not a transaction subsequently  results).   Thus, for example, if a DISC incurs a packaging cost which is otherwise  eligible to be treated as an export promotion expense, the DISC may not  include such charge as an export promotion expense until the year in  which the export property with respect to which the packaging cost was  incurred is actually sold by the DISC. If no transaction is reasonably  expected to result from the packaging cost, such cost should be  allocated as an export promotion expense to the group of transactions to  which such cost is most closely related.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. J and K are calendar year taxpayers. J, a domestic  manufacturing company, owns all the stock of K, a DISC for the taxable  year. During 1972, J manufactures only 100 units of a product (which is  eligible to be export property as defined in section 993(c)). J enters  into a written agreement with K whereby K is granted a sales franchise  with respect to exporting such property and K will receive commissions  with respect to such exports equal to the maximum amount permitted to be  received under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994.  Thereafter, the 100 units are sold for $1,000. J's cost of goods sold  attributable to the 100 units is $650. J's direct selling expenses so  attributable are $100. Although J has other deductible expenses, for  purposes of this example assume that J has no other deductible expenses.  K pays $230 to independent contractors which qualify as export promotion  expenses under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section. K does not perform  functions substantial enough to entitle it to an allocation of income  which meets the arm's length standard of section 482. The income which K  may earn under section 994 under the franchise is $20, computed as  follows:  (1) Combined taxable income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> K's sales price.................................  .......   $1,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">J's cost of goods sold............................     $650</p><p class="depth0">J's direct selling expenses.......................      100</p><p class="depth0">K's export promotion expenses.....................      230</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions..............................  .......      980</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combined taxable income.........................  .......       20</p><p class="depth0">======== (2) K's profit under combined taxable income method (before</p><p class="depth0">application of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 50 percent of combined taxable income....................       10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of K's export promotion expenses (10% of       23</p><p class="depth0">$230).......................................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> K's profit...............................................       33</p><p class="depth0">========== (3) K's profit under gross receipts method (before application</p><p class="depth0">of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 4 percent of K's sales price (4% of $1,000)..............       40</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of K's export promotion expenses (10% of       23</p><p class="depth0">$230).......................................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> K's profit...............................................       63</p><p class="depth0">========</p><p class="depth0">Since combined taxable income ($20) is lower than both K's profit  under the combined taxable income method ($33) and under the gross  receipts method ($63), the maximum income K may earn is $20.  Accordingly, the commissions K may receive from J are $250, i.e., K's  expenses ($230) plus K's profit ($20).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. M and N are calendar year taxpayers. M, a domestic  manufacturing company, owns all the stock of N, a DISC for the taxable  year. During 1972, M produces and sells a particular product line of  export property to N for $75, a price which can be justified as  satisfying the standard of arm's length price of section 482. N performs  substantial functions with respect to the transaction and resells the  export property for $100. M's cost of goods sold attributable to the  export property is $60. M's direct selling expenses so attributable  (relating to advertising of the product line in foreign markets) are  $12. Although M has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this  example, assume that M has no other deductible expenses. N's expenses  attributable to resale of the export property are $22 of which $20 are  export promotion expenses. The maximum profit which N may earn with  respect to the product line is $6, computed as follows:  (1) Combined taxable income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> N's sales price.................................  .......     $100</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">M's cost of goods sold............................      $60</p><p class="depth0">M's direct selling expenses.......................       12</p><p class="depth0">N's expenses......................................       22</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions................................  .......       94</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combined taxable income.........................  .......        6</p><p class="depth0">======== (2) N's profit under combined taxable income method (before</p><p class="depth0">application of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 50 percent of combined taxable income....................        3</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of N's export promotion expenses (10% of        2</p><p class="depth0">$20)........................................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> N's profit...............................................        5</p><p class="depth0">========== (3) N's profit under gross receipts method (before application</p><p class="depth0">of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 4 percent of N's sales price (4% of $100)................        4</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of N's export promotion expenses (10% of        2</p><p class="depth0">$20)........................................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> N's profit...............................................        6</p><p class="depth0">========== (4) N's profit under section 482 method:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> N's sales price..........................................      100</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">N's cost of goods sold (price paid by N to M).....       75</p><p class="depth0">N's expenses......................................       22</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions................................  .......       97</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> N's profit......................................  .......        3</p><p class="depth0">========</p><p class="depth0">Since the gross receipts method results in greater profit to N ($6)  than does the combined taxable income method ($5) or section 482 method  ($3), and does not exceed combined taxable income ($6), N may earn a  maximum profit of $6.

Q and R are calendar year taxpayers. Q, a domestic  manufacturing company, owns all the stock of R, a DISC for the taxable  year. During 1972, Q produces and sells a product line of export  property to R for $170, a price which can be justified as satisfying the  standards of arm's length price of section 482, and R resells the export  property for $200. Q's cost of goods sold attributable to the export  property is $115 so that the combined gross income from the sale of the  export property is $85 (i.e., $200 minus $115). Q's expenses incurred in  connection with the property sold are $35. Q's deductible overhead and  other supportive expenses allocable to all gross income are $6.  Apportionment of these supportive expenses on the basis of gross income  does not result in a material distortion of income and is a reasonable  method of apportionment. Q's gross income from sources other than the  transaction is $170 making total gross income of Q and R (excluding the  transfer price paid by R) $255 (i.e., $85 plus $170). R's expenses  attributable to resale of the export property are $20, all of which are  export promotion expenses.

S and T are calendar year taxpayers. S, a domestic  manufacturing company, owns all the stock of T, a DISC for the taxable  year. During 1972, S produces and sells 100 units of a particular  product to T under a written agreement which provides that the transfer  price between S and T shall be that price which allocates to T the  maximum permitted to be received under the intercompany pricing rules of  section 994. Thereafter, the 100 units are sold by T for $950. S's cost  of goods sold attributable to the 100 units is $650. S's other  deductible expenses so attributable are $300. Although S has other  deductible expenses, for purposes of this example, assume that S has no  deductible expenses not definitely allocable to any item of gross  income. T's expenses attributable to the resale of the 100 units are  $50. S chooses not to apply the section 482 method. T may not earn any  income under   the gross receipts or combined taxable income method with respect to  resale of the 100 units because combined taxable income is a negative  figure, computed as follows:  (1) Combined taxable income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> T's sales price...................................  ......    $950</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">S's cost of goods sold..............................    $650</p><p class="depth0">S's expenses........................................     300</p><p class="depth0">T's expenses........................................      50</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions..................................  ......   1,000</p><p class="depth0">-------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combined taxable income (loss)....................  ......

Accordingly, the transfer price from S to T may be readjusted as long as  the transfer price is not readjusted below $900, computed as follows:  (2) Transfer price from S to T:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> T's sales price...........................................    $950</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less: T's expenses........................................      50</p><p class="depth0">-------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfer price............................................     900</p><p class="depth0">=======</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example 4 except that S  chooses to apply the section 482 method and that under arm's length  dealings T would have derived $10 of income.

X and Y are calendar year taxpayers. X, a domestic  manufacturing company, owns all the stock of Y, a DISC for the taxable  year. During March 1972, X manufactures a particular product of export  property which it leases on April 1, 1972, to Y for a term of 1 year at  a monthly rental of $1,000, a rent which satisfies the standard of arm's  length rental under section 482. Y subleases the product on April 1,  1972, for a term of 1 year at a monthly rental of $1,200. X's cost for  the product leased is $40,000. X's other deductible expenses  attributable to the product are $900, all of which are incurred in 1972.  Although X has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this example,  assume that X has no other deductible expenses. Y's expenses  attributable to sublease of the export property are $450, all of which  are incurred in 1972 and are export promotion expenses. X depreciates  the property on a straight line basis without the use of an averaging  convention, assuming a useful life of 8 years and no salvage value. The  profit which Y may earn with respect to the transaction is $2,895 for  1972 and $1,175 for 1973, computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">computation for 1972 (1) Combined taxable income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Y's sublease rental receipts for year           ........   $10,800</p><p class="depth0">($1,200x9 months)................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">X's depreciation ($40,000x1/8x9/12).............    $3,750</p><p class="depth0">X's other expenses..............................       900</p><p class="depth0">Y's expenses....................................       450</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions..............................  ........     5,100</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combined taxable income.......................  ........     5,700</p><p class="depth0">========= (2) Y's profit under combined taxable income method (before</p><p class="depth0">application of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 50 percent of combined taxable income...................     2,850</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of Y's export promotion expenses (10%          45</p><p class="depth0">of $450)...................................................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Y's profit..............................................     2,895</p><p class="depth0">=========== (3) Y's profit under gross receipts method (before application</p><p class="depth0">of loss limitation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 4 percent of Y's sublease rental receipts for year (4%         432</p><p class="depth0">of $10,800)................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plus: 10 percent of Y's export promotion expenses (10%          45</p><p class="depth0">of $450)...................................................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Y's profit..............................................       477</p><p class="depth0">=========== (4) Y's profit under section 482 method:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Y's sublease rental receipts for year...................   $10,800</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Less deductions:</p><p class="depth0">Y's lease rental payments for year..............    $9,000</p><p class="depth0">Y's expenses....................................       450</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions..................................  ........     9,450</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Y's profit....................................  ........     1,350</p><p class="depth0">Since the combined taxable income method results in greater profit  to Y ($2,895) than does the gross receipts method ($477) or section 482  method ($1,350), Y may earn a profit of $2,895 for 1972.
