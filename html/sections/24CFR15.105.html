                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Multitracking. (1) HUD places each request in one of two tracks. HUD places requests in its simple or complex track based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors HUD will consider in assigning a request in the simple or complex track will include whether the request involves the processing of voluminous documents and/or whether the request involves responsive documents from three or more organizational units. Within each track, HUD processes requests in the order in which they are received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For requests that have been sent to the wrong office, HUD will assign the request within each track using the earlier of either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the request was referred to the appropriate office; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The end of the 10 working day period in which the request should have been referred to the appropriate office under Sec. 15.104(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Expedited processing. HUD may take your request or appeal out of normal order if HUD determines that you have a compelling need for the records or in other cases as determined by the agency. If HUD grants your request for expedited processing, HUD will give your request priority and will process it as soon as practicable. HUD will consider a compelling need to exist if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Your failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or a threatened loss of substantial due process rights; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You are primarily engaged in disseminating information and there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</p>
