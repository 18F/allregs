Based on analysis of housing  assistance needs of families residing or expected to reside in the  project, HUD shall determine the number of units to be assisted up to  100 percent of the units in the project. All units currently assisted  under section 23 or section 8 shall be converted and included under the  Contract pursuant to this subpart, unless the parties to the Lease or  Contract object to such conversion. Units assisted under section 101 of  the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 or under section 236(f)(2)  of the National Housing Act shall not be included under the Contract  pursuant to this subpart unless the Owner proposes and HUD approves such  conversion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum annual Contract commitment. The maximum annual housing  assistance payments that may be committed under the Contract shall be  that amount which, when paid annually over the term of the Contract, is  determined by HUD to be sufficient to provide for all housing assistance  payments and fees under the Contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Project Account. In order to assure that housing assistance  payments will be increased on a timely basis to cover increases in  Contract Rents or decreases in Family Incomes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Project Account shall be established and maintained, in an  amount as determined by the Secretary consistent with his  responsibilities under section 8(c)(6) of the Act, out of amounts by  which the maximum annual Contract commitment per year exceeds amounts  paid under the Contract for any year. This account shall be established  and maintained by HUD for each project as a specifically identified and  segregated account, and payment shall be made therefrom only for the  purposes of (i) housing assistance payments, and (ii) other costs  specifically authorized or approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required housing assistance  payments for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual Contract  commitment, and would cause the amount in the Project Account to be less  than an amount equal to 40 percent of such maximum annual Contract  commitment, HUD shall, within a reasonable period of time, take such  additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the Act as may be  necessary to carry out this assurance, including (as provided in that  section of the Act) ``the allocation of a portion of new authorizations  for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts.''</p>
