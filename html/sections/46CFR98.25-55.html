                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Piping shall be of seamless steel meeting the requirements of  Sec.  56.60-1 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter. The  piping shall be of not less than Schedule 40 thickness. In case of  piping on the discharge side of the liquid pumps or vapor compressors,  the design shall be for a pressure of not less than the pump or  compressor relief valve setting; or if the piping is not fitted with  relief valves, the design pressure shall not be less than the total  discharge head of the pump or compressor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where necessary, provision shall be made for expansion and  contraction of piping by means of seamless steel pipe expansion bends.  Special consideration will be given for packless type expansion joints.  Slip type expansion joints are prohibited. Piping shall be provided with  adequate support to take   the weight of the piping off the valves and fittings.
