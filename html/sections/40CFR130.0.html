                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart establishes policies and program requirements for  water quality planning, management and implementation under sections  106, 205(j), non-construction management 205(g), 208, 303 and 305 of the  Clean Water Act. The Water Quality Management (WQM) process described in  the Act and in this regulation provides the authority for a consistent  national approach for maintaining, improving and protecting water  quality while allowing States to implement the most effective individual  programs. The process is implemented jointly by EPA, the States,  interstate agencies, and areawide, local and regional planning  organizations. This regulation explains the requirements of the Act,  describes the relationships between the several components of the WQM  process and outlines the roles of the major participants in the process.  The components of the WQM process are discussed below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This report and other assessments of water quality are used in  the State's WQM plans to identify priority water quality problems. These  plans also contain the results of the State's analyses and management  decisions which are necessary to control specific sources of pollution.  The plans recommend control measures and designated management agencies  (DMAs) to attain the goals established in the State's water quality  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> These control measures are implemented by issuing permits,  building publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs), instituting best  management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution and other means.  After control measures are in place, the State evaluates the extent of  the resulting improvements in water quality, conducts additional data  gathering and planning to determine needed modifications in control  measures and again institutes control measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This process is a dynamic one, in which requirements and  emphases vary over time. At present, States have completed WQM plans  which are generally comprehensive in geographic and programmatic scope.  Technology based controls are being implemented for most point sources  of pollution. However, WQS have not been attained in many water bodies  and are threatened in others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Present continuing planning requirements serve to identify these  critical water bodies, develop plans for achieving higher levels of  abatement and specify additional control measures. Consequently, this  regulation reflects a programmatic emphasis on concentrating planning  and abatement activities on priority water quality issues and geographic  areas. EPA will focus its grant funds on activities designed to address  these priorities. Annual work programs negotiated between EPA and State  and interstate agencies will reflect this emphasis.</p>
