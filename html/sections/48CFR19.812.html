All contracts and modifications, if any, shall  be distributed to both the SBA and the firm in accordance with the  timeframes set forth in 4.201.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To the extent consistent with the contracting activity's  capability and resources, 8(a) contractors furnishing requirements shall  be afforded production and technical assistance, including, when  appropriate, identification of causes of deficiencies in their products  and suggested corrective action to make such products acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An 8(a) contract, whether in the base or an option year, must be  terminated for convenience if the 8(a) concern to which it was awarded  transfers ownership or control of the firm or if the contract is  transferred or novated for any reason to another firm, unless the  Administrator of the SBA waives the requirement for contract termination  (13 CFR 124.515). The Administrator may waive the termination  requirement only if certain conditions exist. Moreover, a waiver of the  requirement for termination is permitted only if the 8(a) firm's request  for waiver is made to the SBA prior to the actual relinquishment of  ownership or control, except in the case of death or incapacity where  the waiver must be submitted within 60 days after such an occurrence.  The clauses in the contract entitled ``Special 8(a) Contract  Conditions'' and ``Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions'' require the SBA  and the 8(a) subcontractor to notify the contracting officer when  ownership of the firm is being transferred. When the contracting officer  receives information that an 8(a) contractor is planning to transfer  ownership or control to another firm, the contracting officer must take  action immediately to preserve the option of waiving the termination  requirement. The contracting officer should determine the timing of the  proposed transfer and its effect on contract performance and mission  support. If the contracting officer determines that the SBA does not  intend to waive the termination requirement, and termination of the  contract would severely impair attainment of the agency's program  objectives or mission, the contracting officer should immediately notify  the SBA in writing that the agency is requesting a waiver. Within 15  business days thereafter, or such longer period as agreed to by the  agency and the SBA, the agency head must either confirm or withdraw the  request for waiver. Unless a waiver is approved by the SBA, the  contracting officer must terminate the contract for convenience upon  receipt of a written request by the SBA. This requirement for a  convenience termination does not affect the Government's right to  terminate for default if the cause for termination of an 8(a) contract  is other than the transfer of ownership or control.
