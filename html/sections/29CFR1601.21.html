                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After completing its investigation, where the Commission has not  settled or dismissed a charge or made a no cause finding as to every  allegation addressed in the determination under Sec. 1601.19, the  Commission shall issue a determination that reasonable cause exists to  believe that an unlawful employment practice has occurred or is  occurring under title VII, the ADA, or GINA. A determination finding  reasonable cause is based on, and limited to, evidence obtained by the  Commission and does not reflect any judgment on the merits of  allegations not addressed in the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission shall provide prompt notification of its  determination under paragraph (a) of this section to the person claiming  to be aggrieved, the person making the charge on behalf of such person,  if any, and the respondent, or in the case of a Commissioner charge, the  person named in the charge or identified by the Commission in the third  party certificate, if any, and the respondent. The Commission may,  however, on its own initiative reconsider its decision or the  determination of any of its designated officers who   have authority to issue Letters of Determination, Except that the  Commission will not reconsider determinations of reasonable cause  previously issued against a government, governmental entity or political  subdivision after a failure of conciliation as set forth in Sec.  1601.25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (2), the notice of intent to reconsider will vacate the  dismissal or letter of determination, but will not revoke the notice of  right to sue. After reconsideration the Commission will issue a  determination anew. In those circumstances where the notice of right to  sue has been revoked, the Commission will, in accordance with Sec.  1601.28, issue a notice of right to sue anew which will provide the  charging party with 90 days within which to bring suit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission shall provide prompt notification of its intent  to reconsider, which is effective upon issuance, and its final decision  after reconsideration to the person claiming to be aggrieved, the person  making the charge on behalf of such person, if any, and the respondent,  or in the case of a Commissioner charge, the person named in the charge  or identified by the Commissioner in the third-party certificate, if  any, and the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a member of the Commission has filed a Commissioner  charge, he or she shall abstain from making a determination in that  case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission hereby delegates to District Directors, or upon  delegation, Field Directors, Area Directors or Local Directors; and the  Director of the Office of Field Programs, or upon delegation, the  Director of Field Management Programs, the authority, except in those  cases involving issues currently designated by the Commission for  priority review, upon completion of an investigation, to make a  determination finding reasonable cause, issue a cause letter of  determination and serve a copy of the determination upon the parties.  Each determination issued under this section is final when the letter of  determination is issued. However, the Director of the Office of Field  Programs, or upon delegation, the Director of Field Management Programs;  each District Director; each Field Director; each Area Director and each  Local Director, for the determinations issued by his or her office, may  on his or her own initiative reconsider such determinations, except that  such directors may not reconsider determinations of reasonable cause  previously issued against a government, governmental agency or political  subdivision after a failure of conciliation as set forth in Sec.  1601.25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (2), the notice of intent to  reconsider will vacate the dismissal or letter of determination, but  will not revoke the notice of right to sue. After reconsideration the  issuing Director will issue a determination anew. In those circumstances  where the notice of right to sue has been revoked, the issuing Director  will, in accordance with Sec. 1601.28, issue a notice of right to sue  anew which will provide the charging party with 90 days within which to  bring suit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the issuing Director does reconsider, he or she shall  provide prompt notification of his or her intent to reconsider, which is  effective upon issuance, and final decision after reconsideration to the  person claiming to be aggrieved, the person making the charge on behalf  of such person, if any, and the respondent, or in the charge or  identified by the Commissioner in the third party certificate, if any,  and the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In making a determination as to whether reasonable cause exists,  substantial weight shall be accorded final findings and orders made by  designated FEP agencies to which the Commission defers charges pursuant  to Sec. 1601.13. For the purposes of this section, the following  definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Final findings and orders'' shall mean:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The findings of fact and order incident thereto issued by a FEP  agency on the merits of a charge; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consent order or consent decree entered into by the FEP  agency on the merits of a charge.  Provided, however, That no findings and order of a FEP agency shall be  considered final for purposes of this section unless the FEP agency  shall have served a copy of such findings and order upon the Commission  and upon the person claiming to be aggrieved and shall have informed  such person of his or her rights of appeal or to request  reconsideration, or rehearing or similar rights; and the time for such  appeal, reconsideration, or rehearing request shall have expired or the  issues of such appeal, reconsideration or rehearing shall have been  determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Substantial weight'' shall mean that such full and careful  consideration shall be accorded to final findings and orders, as defined  above, as is appropriate in light of the facts supporting them when they  meet all of the prerequisites set forth below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proceedings were fair and regular; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The practices prohibited by the State or local law are  comparable in scope to the practices prohibited by Federal law; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The final findings and order serve the interest of the  effective enforcement of title VII, the ADA, or GINA: Provided, That  giving substantial weight to final findings and orders of a FEP agency  does not include according weight, for purposes of applying Federal law,  to such Agency's conclusions of law.
