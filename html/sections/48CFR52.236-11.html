Before taking  possession of or using any work, the   Contracting Officer shall furnish the Contractor a list of items of work  remaining to be performed or corrected on those portions of the work  that the Government intends to take possession of or use. However,  failure of the Contracting Officer to list any item of work shall not  relieve the Contractor of responsibility for complying with the terms of  the contract. The Government's possession or use shall not be deemed an  acceptance of any work under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While the Government has such possession or use, the Contractor  shall be relieved of the responsibility for the loss of or damage to the  work resulting from the Government's possession or use, notwithstanding  the terms of the clause in this contract entitled Permits and  Responsibilities. If prior possession or use by the Government delays  the progress of the work or causes additional expense to the Contractor,  an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price or the time  of completion, and the contract shall be modified in writing  accordingly.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 34761, July 3, 1995]</p>
