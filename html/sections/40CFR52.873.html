                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Kansas portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was designated as nonattainment for ozone in 40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the Administrator approves continuation of the 7.8 RVP limit as federally enforceable in the Kansas City metropolitan area, even after the area is redesignated to attainment, because of its nonattainment designation effective January 6, 1992. Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP volatility is deemed necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard as demonstrated by the emissions inventory projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in Kansas' ozone maintenance plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator approves Rule K.A.R. 28-19-31 as identified at Sec. 52.870(c)(29), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans

issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as individual SIP revisions.
