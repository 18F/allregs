                                Sec. 53.4965-1  Overview.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Entity-level excise tax. Section 4965 imposes two excise taxes with respect to certain tax shelter transactions to which tax-exempt entities are parties. Section 4965(a)(1) imposes an entity-level excise tax on certain tax-exempt entities that are parties to ``prohibited tax shelter transactions,'' as defined in section 4965(e). See Sec. 53.4965-2 for the discussion of covered tax-exempt entities. See Sec. 53.4965-3 for the definition of prohibited tax shelter transactions. See Sec. 53.4965-4 for the definition of tax-exempt party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction. The entity-level excise tax under section 4965(a)(1) is imposed on a specified percentage of the entity's net income or proceeds that are attributable to the transaction for the relevant tax year (or a period within that tax year). The rate of tax depends on whether the entity knew or had reason to know that the transaction was a prohibited tax shelter transaction at the time the entity became a party to the transaction. See Sec. 53.4965-7(a) for the discussion of the entity-level excise tax under section 4965(a)(1). See Sec. 53.4965-6 for the discussion of ``knowing or having reason to know.'' See Sec. 53.4965-8 for the definition of net income and proceeds and the standard for allocating net income and proceeds

that are attributable to a prohibited tax shelter transaction to various periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manager-level excise tax. Section 4965(a)(2) imposes a manager-level excise tax on ``entity managers,'' as defined in section 4965(d), of tax-exempt entities who approve the entity as a party (or otherwise cause the entity to be a party) to a prohibited tax shelter transaction and know or have reason to know, at the time the tax-exempt entity enters into the transaction, that the transaction is a prohibited tax shelter transaction. See Sec. 53.4965-5 for the definition of entity manager and the meaning of ``approving or otherwise causing,'' and Sec. 53.4965-6 for the discussion of ``knowing or having reason to know.'' See Sec. 53.4965-7(b) for the discussion of the manager-level excise tax under section 4965(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability dates. See Sec. 53.4965-9 for the discussion of the relevant effective and applicability dates.
