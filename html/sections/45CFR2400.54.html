                            <p class="depth0">Stipends shall be used only to pay the costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board associated with graduate study under a fellowship. The costs allowed for a Fellow's room and board will be the amount the Fellow's university reports to the Foundation as the cost of room and board for a graduate student if that student were to share a room at the student's university. If no shared graduate housing exists, then costs for regular shared student housing will be used. If no campus housing exists, the equivalent room and board costs at neighboring universities will be used. Stipends for room, board, and books will be pro-rated for Fellows enrolled in study less than full time. The Foundation will not reimburse Fellows for any portion of their master's degree study, that Fellows may have completed prior to the commencement of their fellowships. Nor will the Foundation reimburse Fellows for any credits acquired above the minimum number of credits required for the degree. If a Fellow has already taken and paid for courses that can be credited toward the Fellow's graduate degree under a fellowship, those must be credited to the degree; the remaining required courses will be paid for by the Foundation.</p>
