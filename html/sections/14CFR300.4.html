                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies after the initiation of a hearing or  enforcement case by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf  of an   office that is a party, another DOT employee who is in fact reviewing  the position taken, or who has participated in developing the position  taken in that case, or, in cases involving accusatory or disciplinary  issues (including all enforcement cases) such employees' supervisors  within that office, shall have no substantive communication with any DOT  decisionmaker, administrative law judge in the case, or other DOT  employee advising them, with respect to that or any factually related  hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order.  In addition, each bureau or office supervisor of a DOT employee who is  participating in a hearing case on behalf of that office when it is a  party shall have no substantive communication with any administrative  law judge in the case, or DOT employee advising the judge, in that or  any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a  published DOT rule or order. For each hearing case, bureau or office  heads shall maintain a publicly available record of those employees who  are participating or are in fact reviewing the position taken, or who  have participated in developing the position taken in that case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In hearing cases involving fares or rates, or applications for a  certificate or permit under 49 U.S.C. 41102 and 41302, or applications  by a holder for a change in a certificate or permit, a supervisor who  would not be permitted to advise the DOT decisionmaker under paragraph  (a) may advise the DOT decisionmaker in the following manner: The  supervisor's advice must either be made orally in an open DOT meeting or  by a memorandum placed in the docket or other public file of such  matter. Oral advice must be summarized in writing by the supervisor and  placed in the docket or file of the matter. A copy of such written  memorandum or summary of oral advice must be served on each party to the  proceeding within 3 business days after such advice is given to the  concerned DOT decisionmaker. Each of the parties may comment in writing  on such advice within 5 business days after service or the summary. In  no event, however, may a supervisor advise the DOT decisionmaker if he  or she acted as the office's counsel or witness in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In enforcement cases, the Office of the Assistant General  Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, under the supervision  of the Deputy General Counsel, will conduct all enforcement proceedings  and related investigative functions, while the General Counsel will  advise the DOT decisionmaker in the course of the decisional process.  The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and  Proceedings will report to the Deputy General Counsel. To ensure the  independence of these functions, this Office and the Deputy General  Counsel, for the purpose of this section, shall be considered an  ``office'' as that term is used in paragraph (a), separate from the  General Counsel and the rest of the Office of the General Counsel.
