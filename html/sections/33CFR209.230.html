                            <p class="depth0">The Department of the Army in accordance with Section 4 of the Flood Control Act of December 22, 1944, as amended by section 4 of the Flood Control Act of July 24, 1946 (60 Stat. 641) prepares and administers plans to obtain the maximum sustained public benefit from the use of reservoir areas under its control for recreation and other related purposes, when such use is consistent with the operation and maintenance of the reservoir project for the specific purposes of the reservoir project as authorized by law and when such use is determined not to be contrary to the public interest. The plans are prepared and administered by the District Engineers, subject to review and approval of the Division Engineers and the Chief of Engineers, in close cooperation with other Federal agencies and local interests. The views and desires of these agencies and local interests are obtained normally by conferences with the District Engineers. In many cases, public hearings are held by the District Engineers at appropriate times in the vicinity of the reservoir area at which time anyone can express his views relative to these plans for consideration of the Department of the Army. Rules and regulations are prescribed by the Secretary of the Army to govern the public use of the reservoir areas in accordance with the law as a part of the master plan for recreational and related uses of the reservoir area. These rules and regulations are published in 36 CFR parts 311 to 326. Licenses and leases are granted under the law containing conditions and provisions to govern the use of specific portions of the reservoir area. Full information concerning such matters may be obtained from the District Engineer in charge of the reservoir.</p>
