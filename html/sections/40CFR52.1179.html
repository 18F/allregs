                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval--On March 18, 1999, the Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit CO  nonattainment area (consisting of portions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb  Counties) to attainment for CO. As part of the redesignation request,  the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean  Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance  plan include a base year (1996 attainment year) emission inventory for  CO, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected  emission inventories to the year 2010, a plan to verify continued  attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent  maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act.  If the area records a violation of the CO NAAQS (which must be confirmed  by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate  contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The  menu of contingency measures includes enforceable emission limitations  for stationary sources, transportation control measures, or a vehicle  inspection and maintenance program. The redesignation request and  maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections  107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval--On December 19, 2003, Michigan submitted a request to  revise its plan for the Southeast Michigan CO maintenance area  (consisting of portions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties). The  submittal contains updated emission inventories for 1996 and 2010, and  an update to the 2010 motor vehicle emissions budget (MVEB). The 2010  MVEB is 3,842.9 tons of CO per day.
