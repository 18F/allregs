This gear shall be visually inspected by  the vessel's captain or his designee at frequent intervals,   and in any event not less than once in each operating month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the inspection required in paragraph (b) of this  section, a biennial, (every second year), thorough examination and proof  load test, at a minimum of the SWL rating, shall be performed and  witnessed by competent personnel. The proof load applied to the winches,  booms, derricks, cranes and all associated gear shall be lifted with the  ship's normal tackle with the boom or derrick at the lowest practicable  angle. When the load has been lifted, it shall be swung as far as  possible in both directions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After satisfactory completion of the tests and examinations  required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all results and  notations together with the date and location of each shall be  maintained and available to Coast Guard representatives upon request.</p>
