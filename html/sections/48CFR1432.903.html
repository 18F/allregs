When considering a  modification to these FAR standard(s), the CO should alert the finance  and program officials involved in the payment process to ensure that  such shorter contract payment terms to be specified in the solicitation  and resulting contract will be met. A CO determination justifying a  shorter payment period must be documented in writing, and incorporated  into the solicitation/contract file.</p>
