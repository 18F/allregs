                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Meaning of terms. For purposes of this section, except where the  context clearly indicates otherwise, the following terms have the  meanings indicated:</p><p class="depth0">Aggregate lifetime dollar limit means a dollar limitation on the  total amount of specified benefits that may be paid under a group health  plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a  plan) for any coverage unit.</p><p class="depth0">Annual dollar limit means a dollar limitation on the total amount of  specified benefits that may be paid in a 12-month period under a group  health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with  such a plan) for any coverage unit.</p><p class="depth0">Coverage unit means coverage unit as described in paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative financial requirements are financial requirements that  determine whether or to what extent benefits are provided based on  accumulated amounts and include deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.  (However, cumulative financial requirements do not include aggregate  lifetime or annual dollar limits because these two terms are excluded  from the meaning of financial requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative quantitative treatment limitations are treatment  limitations that determine whether or to what extent benefits are  provided based on accumulated amounts, such as annual or lifetime day or  visit limits.</p><p class="depth0">Financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance,  or out-of-pocket maximums. Financial requirements do not include  aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits.</p><p class="depth0">Medical/surgical benefits means benefits with respect to items or  services for medical conditions or surgical procedures, as defined under  the terms of the plan or health insurance coverage and in accordance  with applicable Federal and State law, but does not include mental  health or substance use   disorder benefits. Any condition defined by the plan or coverage as  being or as not being a medical/surgical condition must be defined to be  consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current  medical practice (for example, the most current version of the  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or State guidelines).</p><p class="depth0">Mental health benefits means benefits with respect to items or  services for mental health conditions, as defined under the terms of the  plan or health insurance coverage and in accordance with applicable  Federal and State law. Any condition defined by the plan or coverage as  being or as not being a mental health condition must be defined to be  consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current  medical practice (for example, the most current version of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the most  current version of the ICD, or State guidelines).</p><p class="depth0">Substance use disorder benefits means benefits with respect to items  or services for substance use disorders, as defined under the terms of  the plan or health insurance coverage and in accordance with applicable  Federal and State law. Any disorder defined by the plan as being or as  not being a substance use disorder must be defined to be consistent with  generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice  (for example, the most current version of the DSM, the most current  version of the ICD, or State guidelines).</p><p class="depth0">Treatment limitations include limits on benefits based on the  frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, days in a  waiting period, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of  treatment. Treatment limitations include both quantitative treatment  limitations, which are expressed numerically (such as 50 outpatient  visits per year), and nonquantitative treatment limitations, which  otherwise limit the scope or duration of benefits for treatment under a  plan or coverage. (See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for an  illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.) A permanent  exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder,  however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> does not address the provisions of PHS Act  section 2711, which prohibit imposing lifetime and annual limits on the  dollar value of essential health benefits. For more information, see  Sec. 147.126 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General parity requirement. A group health plan (or  health insurance coverage offered by an issuer in connection with a  group health plan) that provides both medical/surgical benefits and  mental health or substance use disorder benefits must comply with  paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. The rule in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does  not apply if a plan (or health insurance coverage) satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (f) or (g) of this section (relating to  exemptions for small employers and for increased cost).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan with no limit or limits on less than one-third of all  medical/surgical benefits. If a plan (or health insurance coverage) does  not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on any medical/ surgical benefits or includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar  limit that applies to less than one-third of all medical/surgical  benefits, it may not impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar  limit, respectively, on mental health or substance use disorder  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan with a limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical  benefits. If a plan (or health insurance coverage) includes an aggregate  lifetime or annual dollar limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/ surgical benefits, it must either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Apply the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit both to the  medical/surgical benefits to which the limit would otherwise apply and  to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a manner that  does not distinguish between the medical/surgical benefits and mental  health or substance use disorder benefits; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on  mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the  aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on medical/ surgical benefits. (For cumulative limits other than aggregate lifetime  or annual dollar limits, see paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section  prohibiting separately accumulating cumulative financial requirements or  cumulative quantitative treatment limitations.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determining one-third and two-thirds of all medical/surgical  benefits. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the determination of  whether the portion of medical/surgical benefits subject to an aggregate  lifetime or annual dollar limit represents one-third or two-thirds of  all medical/surgical benefits is based on the dollar amount of all plan  payments for medical/surgical benefits expected to be paid under the  plan for the plan year (or for the portion of the plan year after a  change in plan benefits that affects the applicability of the aggregate  lifetime or annual dollar limits). Any reasonable method may be used to  determine whether the dollar amount expected to be paid under the plan  will constitute one-third or two-thirds of the dollar amount of all plan  payments for medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plan not described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this  section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A group health plan (or health insurance  coverage) that is not described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this  section with respect to aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits on  medical/surgical benefits, must either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Impose no aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, as  appropriate, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>. In addition, for purposes of determining  weighted averages, any benefits that are not within a category that is  subject to a separately-designated dollar limit under the plan are taken  into account as a single separate category by using an estimate of the  upper limit on the dollar amount that a plan may reasonably be expected  to incur with respect to such benefits, taking into account any other  applicable restrictions under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Weighting. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), the weighting  applicable to any category of medical/surgical benefits is determined in  the manner set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for determining  one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Parity requirements with respect to financial requirements and  treatment limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Clarification of terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Classification of  benefits. When reference is made in this paragraph (c) to a  classification of benefits, the term ``classification'' means a  classification as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section for an  illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Level of a type of financial requirement or treatment  limitation. When reference is made in this paragraph (c) to a level of a  type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, level refers to  the magnitude of the type of financial requirement or treatment  limitation. For example, different levels of coinsurance include 20  percent and 30   percent; different levels of a copayment include $15 and $20; different  levels of a deductible include $250 and $500; and different levels of an  episode limit include 21 inpatient days per episode and 30 inpatient  days per episode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coverage unit. When reference is made in this paragraph (c) to  a coverage unit, coverage unit refers to the way in which a plan (or  health insurance coverage) groups individuals for purposes of  determining benefits, or premiums or contributions. For example,  different coverage units include self-only, family, and employee-plus- spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General parity requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A group health  plan (or health insurance coverage offered by an issuer in connection  with a group health plan) that provides both medical/surgical benefits  and mental health or substance use disorder benefits may not apply any  financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or  substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more  restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment  limitation of that type applied to substantially all medical/surgical  benefits in the same classification. Whether a financial requirement or  treatment limitation is a predominant financial requirement or treatment  limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits  in a classification is determined separately for each type of financial  requirement or treatment limitation. The application of the rules of  this paragraph (c)(2) to financial requirements and quantitative  treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;  the application of the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) to nonquantitative  treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)</em> of this section). The following  classifications of benefits are the only classifications used in  applying the rules of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inpatient, in-network. Benefits furnished on an inpatient basis  and within a network of providers established or recognized under a plan  or health insurance coverage. See special rules for plans with multiple  network tiers in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inpatient, out-of-network. Benefits furnished on an inpatient  basis and outside any network of providers established or recognized  under a plan or health insurance coverage. This classification includes  inpatient benefits under a plan (or health insurance coverage) that has  no network of providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Outpatient, out-of-network. Benefits furnished on an outpatient  basis and outside any network of providers established or recognized  under a plan or health insurance coverage. This classification includes  outpatient benefits under a plan (or health insurance coverage) that has  no network of providers. See special rules for office visits in  paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emergency care. Benefits for emergency care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Prescription drugs. Benefits for prescription drugs. See special  rules for   multi-tiered prescription drug benefits in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application to out-of-network providers. See paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, under which a plan (or health insurance  coverage) that provides mental health or substance use disorder benefits  in any classification of benefits must provide mental health or  substance use disorder benefits in every classification in which  medical/surgical benefits are provided, including out-of-network  classifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are illustrated  by the following examples. In each example, the group health plan is  subject to the requirements of this section and provides both medical/ surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan offers inpatient and  outpatient benefits and does not contract with a network of providers.  The plan imposes a $500 deductible on all benefits. For inpatient  medical/surgical benefits, the plan imposes a coinsurance requirement.  For outpatient medical/surgical benefits, the plan imposes copayments.  The plan imposes no other financial requirements or treatment  limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, because the plan has no network  of providers, all benefits provided are out-of-network. Because  inpatient, out-of-network medical/surgical benefits are subject to  separate financial requirements from outpatient, out-of-network medical/ surgical benefits, the rules of this paragraph (c) apply separately with  respect to any financial requirements and treatment limitations,  including the deductible, in each classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan imposes a $500 deductible on all  benefits. The plan has no network of providers. The plan generally  imposes a 20 percent coinsurance requirement with respect to all  benefits, without distinguishing among inpatient, outpatient, emergency  care, or prescription drug benefits. The plan imposes no other financial  requirements or treatment limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, because the plan does not impose  separate financial requirements (or treatment limitations) based on  classification, the rules of this paragraph (c) apply with respect to  the deductible and the coinsurance across all benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 2, except the plan  exempts emergency care benefits from the 20 percent coinsurance  requirement. The plan imposes no other financial requirements or  treatment limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, because the plan imposes  separate financial requirements based on classifications, the rules of  this paragraph (c) apply with respect to the deductible and the  coinsurance separately for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Benefits in the emergency care classification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All other benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 2, except the plan also  imposes a preauthorization requirement for all inpatient treatment in  order for benefits to be paid. No such requirement applies to outpatient  treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, because the plan has no network  of providers, all benefits provided are out-of-network. Because the plan  imposes a separate treatment limitation based on classifications, the  rules of this paragraph (c) apply with respect to the deductible and  coinsurance separately for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Inpatient, out-of-network benefits; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All other benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining ``substantially all'' and ``predominant''--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Substantially all. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a type of  financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation is considered  to apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a  classification of benefits if it applies to at least two-thirds of all  medical/surgical benefits in that classification. (For this purpose,  benefits expressed as subject to a zero level of a type of financial  requirement are treated as benefits not subject to that type of  financial requirement, and benefits expressed as subject to a  quantitative treatment limitation that is unlimited are treated as  benefits not subject to that type of quantitative treatment limitation.)  If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation  does not apply to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits  in a classification, then that type cannot be applied to mental health  or substance use disorder benefits in that classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Predominant--(1) If a type of financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation applies to at least two-thirds of all  medical/surgical benefits in a classification as determined under  paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the level of the financial  requirement or quantitative treatment   limitation that is considered the predominant level of that type in a  classification of benefits is the level that applies to more than one- half of medical/surgical benefits in that classification subject to the  financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If, with respect to a type of financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation that applies to at least two-thirds of  all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, there is no single  level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in  the classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative  treatment limitation, the plan (or health insurance issuer) may combine  levels until the combination of levels applies to more than one-half of  medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation in the classification. The least  restrictive level within the combination is considered the predominant  level of that type in the classification. (For this purpose, a plan may  combine the most restrictive levels first, with each less restrictive  level added to the combination until the combination applies to more  than one-half of the benefits subject to the financial requirement or  treatment limitation.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Portion based on plan payments. For purposes of this paragraph  (c), the determination of the portion of medical/surgical benefits in a  classification of benefits subject to a financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a  financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation) is based on  the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits in  the classification expected to be paid under the plan for the plan year  (or for the portion of the plan year after a change in plan benefits  that affects the applicability of the financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Clarifications for certain threshold requirements. For any  deductible, the dollar amount of plan payments includes all plan  payments with respect to claims that would be subject to the deductible  if it had not been satisfied. For any out-of-pocket maximum, the dollar  amount of plan payments includes all plan payments associated with out- of-pocket payments that are taken into account towards the out-of-pocket  maximum as well as all plan payments associated with out-of-pocket  payments that would have been made towards the out-of-pocket maximum if  it had not been satisfied. Similar rules apply for any other thresholds  at which the rate of plan payment changes. (See also PHS Act section  2707(b) and Affordable Care Act section 1302(c), which establish  limitations on annual deductibles for non-grandfathered health plans in  the small group market and annual limitations on out-of-pocket maximums  for all non-grandfathered health plans.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Determining the dollar amount of plan payments. Subject to  paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, any reasonable method may be  used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under a plan for  medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or  quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a  financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application to different coverage units. If a plan (or health  insurance coverage) applies different levels of a financial requirement  or quantitative treatment limitation to different coverage units in a  classification of medical/surgical benefits, the predominant level that  applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the  classification is determined separately for each coverage unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Multi-tiered prescription drug benefits. If  a plan (or health insurance coverage) applies different levels of  financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits  based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the rules in  paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (relating to requirements for  nonquantitative treatment limitations) and without regard to whether a  drug is generally prescribed with respect to medical/surgical benefits  or with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the  plan (or health insurance coverage) satisfies the parity requirements of  this paragraph (c) with respect to prescription drug benefits.  Reasonable factors include cost, efficacy, generic versus   brand name, and mail order versus pharmacy pick-up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiple network tiers. If a plan (or health insurance coverage)  provides benefits through multiple tiers of in-network providers (such  as an in-network tier of preferred providers with more generous cost- sharing to participants than a separate in-network tier of participating  providers), the plan may divide its benefits furnished on an in-network  basis into sub-classifications that reflect network tiers, if the  tiering is based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the  rules in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (such as quality,  performance, and market standards) and without regard to whether a  provider provides services with respect to medical/surgical benefits or  mental health or substance use disorder benefits. After the sub- classifications are established, the plan or issuer may not impose any  financial requirement or treatment limitation on mental health or  substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more  restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment  limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits  in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph  (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Office visits (such as physician visits), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient  surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges,  or other medical items).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraphs (c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii), and  (c)(3)(iii) of this section are illustrated by the following examples.  In each example, the group health plan is subject to the requirements of  this section and provides both medical/surgical benefits and mental  health and substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For inpatient, out-of-network medical/surgical  benefits, a group health plan imposes five levels of coinsurance. Using  a reasonable method, the plan projects its payments for the upcoming  year as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Coinsurance rate................  0%        10%            15%           20%           30%            Total. Projected payments..............  $200x     $100x          $450x         $100x         $150x          $1,000x. Percent of total plan costs.....  20%       10%            45%           10%           15% Percent subject to coinsurance    N/A       12.5%          56.25%        12.5%         18.75%</p><p class="depth0">level.                                     (100x/800x)    (450x/800x)   (100x/800x)   (150x/800x) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The plan projects plan costs of $800x to be subject to coinsurance  ($100x + $450x + $100x + $150x = $800x). Thus, 80 percent ($800x/ $1,000x) of the benefits are projected to be subject to coinsurance, and  56.25 percent of the benefits subject to coinsurance are projected to be  subject to the 15 percent coinsurance level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the two-thirds threshold of the  substantially all standard is met for coinsurance because 80 percent of  all inpatient, out-of-network medical/surgical benefits are subject to  coinsurance. Moreover, the 15 percent coinsurance is the predominant  level because it is applicable to more than one-half of inpatient, out- of-network medical/surgical benefits subject to the coinsurance  requirement. The plan may not impose any level of coinsurance with  respect to inpatient, out-of-network   mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is more  restrictive than the 15 percent level of coinsurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For outpatient, in-network medical/surgical  benefits, a plan imposes five different copayment levels. Using a  reasonable method, the plan projects payments for the upcoming year as  follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copayment amount................  $0        $10            $15           $20           $50            Total. Projected payments..............  $200x     $200x          $200x         $300x         $100x          $1,000x. Percent of total plan costs.....  20%       20%            20%           30%           10% Percent subject to copayments...  N/A       25%            25%           37.5%         12.5%</p><p class="depth0"><em>(200x/800x)</em>    (200x/800x)   (300x/800x)   (100x/800x) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The plan projects plan costs of $800x to be subject to copayments ($200x  + $200x + $300x + $100x = $800x). Thus, 80 percent ($800x/$1,000x) of  the benefits are projected to be subject to a copayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the two-thirds threshold of the  substantially all standard is met for copayments because 80 percent of  all outpatient, in-network medical/surgical benefits are subject to a  copayment. Moreover, there is no single level that applies to more than  one-half of medical/surgical benefits in the classification subject to a  copayment (for the $10 copayment, 25%; for the $15 copayment, 25%; for  the $20 copayment, 37.5%; and for the $50 copayment, 12.5%). The plan  can combine any levels of copayment, including the highest levels, to  determine the predominant level that can be applied to mental health or  substance use disorder benefits. If the plan combines the highest levels  of copayment, the combined projected payments for the two highest  copayment levels, the $50 copayment and the $20 copayment, are not more  than one-half of the outpatient, in-network medical/surgical benefits  subject to a copayment because they are exactly one-half ($300x + $100x  = $400x; $400x/$800x = 50%). The combined projected payments for the  three highest copayment levels--the $50 copayment, the $20 copayment,  and the $15 copayment--are more than one-half of the outpatient, in- network medical/surgical benefits subject to the copayments ($100x +  $300x + $200x = $600x; $600x/$800x = 75%). Thus, the plan may not impose  any copayment on outpatient, in-network mental health or substance use  disorder benefits that is more restrictive than the least restrictive  copayment in the combination, the $15 copayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan imposes a $250 deductible on all  medical/surgical benefits for self-only coverage and a $500 deductible  on all medical/surgical benefits for family coverage. The plan has no  network of providers. For all medical/surgical benefits, the plan  imposes a coinsurance requirement. The plan imposes no other financial  requirements or treatment limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, because the plan has no network  of providers, all benefits are provided out-of-network. Because self- only and family coverage are subject to different deductibles, whether  the deductible applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits is  determined separately for self-only medical/surgical benefits and family  medical/surgical benefits. Because the coinsurance is applied without  regard to coverage units, the predominant coinsurance that applies to  substantially all medical/surgical benefits is determined without regard  to coverage units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section (relating to requirements for  nonquantitative treatment limitations).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Tier 1           Tier 2           Tier 3           Tier 4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Non-preferred</p><p class="depth0">brand name</p><p class="depth0">Preferred brand    drugs (which</p><p class="depth0">Tier description                 Generic drugs      name drugs    may have Tier 1  Specialty drugs</p><p class="depth0">or Tier 2</p><p class="depth0">alternatives) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Percent paid by plan........................             90%              80%              60%              50% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the financial requirements that  apply to prescription drug benefits are applied without regard to  whether a drug is generally prescribed with respect to medical/surgical  benefits or with respect to mental health or substance use   disorder benefits; the process for certifying drugs in different tiers  complies with paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and the bases for  establishing different levels or types of financial requirements are  reasonable. The financial requirements applied to prescription drug  benefits do not violate the parity requirements of this paragraph  (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, such as accreditation, quality and  performance measures (including customer feedback), and relative  reimbursement rates. Furthermore, provider tier placement is determined  without regard to whether a provider specializes in the treatment of  mental health conditions or substance use disorders, or medical/surgical  conditions. The plan divides the in-network classifications into two  sub-classifications (in-network/preferred and in-network/participating).  The plan does not impose any financial requirement or treatment  limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in either  of these sub-classifications that is more restrictive than the  predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation that applies  to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in each sub- classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the division of in-network  benefits into sub-classifications that reflect the preferred and  participating provider tiers does not violate the parity requirements of  this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. With respect to outpatient, in-network  benefits, a plan imposes a $25 copayment for office visits and a 20  percent coinsurance requirement for outpatient surgery. The plan divides  the outpatient, in-network classification into two sub-classifications  (in-network office visits and all other outpatient, in-network items and  services). The plan or issuer does not impose any financial requirement  or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use  disorder benefits in either of these sub-classifications that is more  restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative  treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical  benefits in each sub-classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, the division of outpatient, in- network benefits into sub-classifications for office visits and all  other outpatient, in-network items and services does not violate the  parity requirements of this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 6, but for purposes of  determining parity, the plan divides the outpatient, in-network  classification into outpatient, in-network generalists and outpatient,  in-network specialists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 7, the division of outpatient, in- network benefits into any sub-classifications other than office visits  and all other outpatient items and services violates the requirements of  paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No separate cumulative financial requirements or cumulative  quantitative treatment limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A group health plan (or health  insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) may  not apply any cumulative financial requirement or cumulative  quantitative treatment limitation for mental health or substance use  disorder benefits in a classification that accumulates separately from  any established for medical/surgical benefits in the same  classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(v) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan imposes a combined annual  $500 deductible on all medical/surgical, mental health, and substance  use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion.

A plan imposes an annual $250 deductible on  all medical/surgical benefits and a separate annual $250 deductible on  all mental health and substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the separate annual deductible  on mental health and substance use disorder benefits violates the  requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan imposes an annual $300 deductible on  all medical/surgical benefits and a separate annual $100 deductible on  all mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the separate annual deductible  on mental health and substance use disorder benefits violates the  requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan generally imposes a combined annual  $500 deductible on all benefits (both medical/surgical benefits and  mental health and substance use disorder benefits) except prescription  drugs. Certain benefits, such as preventive care, are provided without  regard to the deductible. The imposition of other types of financial  requirements or treatment limitations varies with each classification.  Using reasonable methods, the plan projects its payments for medical/ surgical benefits in each classification for the upcoming year as  follows:     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Benefits                         Percent</p><p class="depth0">Classification                             subject to    Total benefits    subject to</p><p class="depth0">deductible                      deductible ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Inpatient, in-network...........................................         $1,800x         $2,000x              90 Inpatient, out-of-network.......................................          1,000x          1,000x             100 Outpatient, in-network..........................................          1,400x          2,000x              70 Outpatient, out-of-network......................................          1,880x          2,000x              94 Emergency care..................................................            300x            500x              60 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the two-thirds threshold of the  substantially all standard is met with respect to each classification  except emergency care because in each of those other classifications at  least two-thirds of medical/surgical benefits are subject to the $500  deductible. Moreover, the $500 deductible is the predominant level in  each of those other classifications because it is the only level.  However, emergency care mental health and substance use disorder  benefits cannot be subject to the $500 deductible because it does not  apply to substantially all emergency care medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nonquantitative treatment limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A group  health plan (or health insurance coverage) may not impose a  nonquantitative treatment limitation with respect to mental health or  substance use disorder benefits in any classification unless, under the  terms of the plan (or health insurance coverage) as written and in  operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other  factors used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to  mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification  are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the  processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in  applying the limitation with respect to medical/surgical benefits in the  classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.  Nonquantitative treatment limitations include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Medical management standards limiting or excluding benefits  based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness, or based on  whether the treatment is experimental or investigative;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Formulary design for prescription drugs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For plans with multiple network tiers (such as preferred  providers and participating providers), network tier design;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Standards for provider admission to participate in a network,  including reimbursement rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Plan methods for determining usual, customary, and reasonable  charges;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Refusal to pay for higher-cost therapies until it can be shown  that a lower-cost therapy is not effective (also known as fail-first  policies or step therapy protocols);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Exclusions based on failure to complete a course of treatment;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Restrictions based on geographic location, facility type,  provider specialty, and other criteria that limit the scope or duration  of benefits for services provided under the plan or coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(4) are illustrated  by the following examples. In each example, the group health plan is  subject to the requirements of this section and provides both medical/ surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan requires prior authorization from the  plan's utilization reviewer that a treatment is medically necessary for  all inpatient medical/surgical benefits and for all inpatient mental  health and substance use disorder benefits. In practice, inpatient  benefits for medical/surgical conditions are routinely approved for  seven days, after which a treatment plan must be submitted by the  patient's attending provider and approved by the plan. On the other  hand, for inpatient mental health and substance use disorder benefits,  routine approval is given only for one day, after which a treatment plan  must be submitted by the patient's attending provider and approved by  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4) because it is applying a stricter nonquantitative  treatment limitation in practice to mental health and substance use  disorder benefits than is applied to medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan applies concurrent review to inpatient  care where there are high levels of variation in length of stay (as  measured by a coefficient of variation exceeding 0.8). In practice, the  application of this standard affects 60 percent of mental health  conditions and substance use disorders, but only 30 percent of medical/ surgical conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan complies with the rules  of this paragraph (c)(4) because the evidentiary standard used by the  plan is applied no more stringently for mental health and substance use  disorder benefits than for medical/surgical benefits, even though it  results in an overall difference in the application of concurrent review  for mental health conditions or substance use disorders than for  medical/surgical conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan requires prior approval that a course  of treatment is medically necessary for outpatient, in-network medical/ surgical, mental health, and substance use disorder benefits and uses  comparable criteria in determining whether a course of treatment is  medically necessary. For mental health and substance use disorder  treatments that do not have prior approval, no benefits will be paid;  for medical/surgical treatments that do not have prior approval, there  will only be a 25 percent reduction in the benefits the plan would  otherwise pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4). Although the same nonquantitative treatment  limitation--medical necessity--is applied both to mental health and  substance use disorder benefits and to medical/surgical benefits for  outpatient, in-network services, it is not applied in a comparable way.  The penalty for failure to obtain prior approval for mental health and  substance use disorder benefits is not comparable to the penalty for  failure to obtain prior approval for medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan generally covers medically appropriate  treatments. For both medical/surgical benefits and mental health and  substance use disorder benefits, evidentiary standards used in  determining whether a treatment is medically appropriate (such as the  number of visits or days of coverage) are based on recommendations made  by panels of experts with appropriate training and experience in the  fields of medicine involved. The evidentiary standards are applied in a  manner that is based on clinically appropriate standards of care for a  condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the plan complies with the rules  of this paragraph (c)(4) because the processes for developing the  evidentiary standards used to determine medical appropriateness and the  application of these standards to mental health and substance use  disorder benefits are comparable to and are applied no more stringently  than for medical/surgical benefits. This is the result even if the  application of the evidentiary standards does not result in similar  numbers of visits, days of coverage, or other benefits utilized for  mental health conditions or substance use disorders as it does for any  particular medical/surgical condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan generally covers medically appropriate  treatments. In determining whether prescription drugs are medically  appropriate, the plan automatically excludes coverage for antidepressant  drugs that are given a black box warning label by the Food and Drug  Administration (indicating the drug carries a significant risk of  serious adverse effects). For other drugs with a black box warning  (including those prescribed for other mental health conditions and  substance use disorders, as well as for medical/surgical conditions),  the plan will provide coverage if the prescribing physician obtains  authorization from the plan that the drug is medically appropriate for  the individual, based on clinically appropriate standards of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4). Although the standard for applying a  nonquantitative treatment limitation is the same for both mental health  and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits-- whether a drug has a black box warning--it is not applied in a  comparable manner. The plan's unconditional exclusion of antidepressant  drugs given a black box warning is not comparable to the conditional  exclusion for other drugs with a black box warning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer maintains both a major medical  plan and an employee assistance program (EAP). The EAP provides, among  other benefits, a limited number of mental health or substance use  disorder counseling sessions. Participants are eligible for mental  health or substance use disorder benefits under the major medical plan  only after exhausting the counseling sessions provided by the EAP. No  similar exhaustion requirement applies with respect to medical/surgical  benefits provided under the major medical plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, limiting eligibility for mental  health and substance use disorder benefits only after EAP benefits are  exhausted is a nonquantitative treatment limitation subject to the  parity requirements of this paragraph (c). Because no comparable  requirement applies to medical/surgical benefits, the requirement may  not be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Training and State licensing requirements  often vary among types of providers. A plan applies a general standard  that any provider must meet the   highest licensing requirement related to supervised clinical experience  under applicable State law in order to participate in the plan's  provider network. Therefore, the plan requires master's-level mental  health therapists to have post-degree, supervised clinical experience  but does not impose this requirement on master's-level general medical  providers because the scope of their licensure under applicable State  law does require clinical experience. In addition, the plan does not  require post-degree, supervised clinical experience for psychiatrists or  Ph.D. level psychologists since their licensing already requires  supervised training.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 7, the plan complies with the rules  of this paragraph (c)(4). The requirement that master's-level mental  health therapists must have supervised clinical experience to join the  network is permissible, as long as the plan consistently applies the  same standard to all providers even though it may have a disparate  impact on certain mental health providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan considers a wide array of factors in  designing medical management techniques for both mental health and  substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits, such as  cost of treatment; high cost growth; variability in cost and quality;  elasticity of demand; provider discretion in determining diagnosis, or  type or length of treatment; clinical efficacy of any proposed treatment  or service; licensing and accreditation of providers; and claim types  with a high percentage of fraud. Based on application of these factors  in a comparable fashion, prior authorization is required for some (but  not all) mental health and substance use disorder benefits, as well as  for some medical/surgical benefits, but not for others. For example, the  plan requires prior authorization for: Outpatient surgery; speech,  occupational, physical, cognitive and behavioral therapy extending for  more than six months; durable medical equipment; diagnostic imaging;  skilled nursing visits; home infusion therapy; coordinated home care;  pain management; high-risk prenatal care; delivery by cesarean section;  mastectomy; prostate cancer treatment; narcotics prescribed for more  than seven days; and all inpatient services beyond 30 days. The evidence  considered in developing its medical management techniques includes  consideration of a wide array of recognized medical literature and  professional standards and protocols (including comparative  effectiveness studies and clinical trials). This evidence and how it was  used to develop these medical management techniques is also well  documented by the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 8, the plan complies with the rules  of this paragraph (c)(4). Under the terms of the plan as written and in  operation, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other  factors considered by the plan in implementing its prior authorization  requirement with respect to mental health and substance use disorder  benefits are comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, those  applied with respect to medical/surgical benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan generally covers medically appropriate  treatments. The plan automatically excludes coverage for inpatient  substance use disorder treatment in any setting outside of a hospital  (such as a freestanding or residential treatment center). For inpatient  treatment outside of a hospital for other conditions (including  freestanding or residential treatment centers prescribed for mental  health conditions, as well as for medical/surgical conditions), the plan  will provide coverage if the prescribing physician obtains authorization  from the plan that the inpatient treatment is medically appropriate for  the individual, based on clinically appropriate standards of care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 9, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4). Although the same nonquantitative treatment  limitation--medical appropriateness--is applied to both mental health  and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits, the  plan's unconditional exclusion of substance use disorder treatment in  any setting outside of a hospital is not comparable to the conditional  exclusion of inpatient treatment outside of a hospital for other  conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan generally provides coverage for  medically appropriate medical/surgical benefits as well as mental health  and substance use disorder benefits. The plan excludes coverage for  inpatient, out-of-network treatment of chemical dependency when obtained  outside of the State where the policy is written. There is no similar  exclusion for medical/surgical benefits within the same classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 10, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4). The plan is imposing a nonquantitative treatment  limitation that restricts benefits based on geographic location. Because  there is no comparable exclusion that applies to medical/surgical  benefits, this exclusion may not be applied to mental health or  substance use disorder benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan requires prior authorization for all  outpatient mental health and substance use disorder services after the  ninth visit and will only approve up to five additional visits per  authorization. With respect to outpatient medical/surgical benefits, the  plan allows an initial visit without prior authorization. After the  initial visit, the plan pre-approves benefits based on the individual  treatment plan recommended by the attending provider based on that  individual's specific medical condition. There is no explicit,  predetermined cap on the   amount of additional visits approved per authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 11, the plan violates the rules of  this paragraph (c)(4). Although the same nonquantitative treatment  limitation--prior authorization to determine medical appropriateness--is  applied to both mental health and substance use disorder benefits and  medical/surgical benefits for outpatient services, it is not applied in  a comparable way. While the plan is more generous with respect to the  number of visits initially provided without pre-authorization for mental  health benefits, treating all mental health conditions and substance use  disorders in the same manner, while providing for individualized  treatment of medical conditions, is not a comparable application of this  nonquantitative treatment limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exemptions. The rules of this paragraph (c) do not apply if a  group health plan (or health insurance coverage) satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (f) or (g) of this section (relating to  exemptions for small employers and for increased cost).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Availability of plan information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for medical  necessity determinations. The criteria for medical necessity  determinations made under a group health plan with respect to mental  health or substance use disorder benefits (or health insurance coverage  offered in connection with the plan with respect to such benefits) must  be made available by the plan administrator (or the health insurance  issuer offering such coverage) to any current or potential participant,  beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provisions of other law. Compliance with the disclosure  requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section is not  determinative of compliance with any other provision of applicable  Federal or State law. In particular, in addition to those disclosure  requirements, provisions of other applicable law require disclosure of  information relevant to medical/surgical, mental health, and substance  use disorder benefits. For example, Sec. 147.136 of this subchapter  sets forth rules regarding claims and appeals, including the right of  claimants (or their authorized representative) upon appeal of an adverse  benefit determination (or a final internal adverse benefit  determination) to be provided upon request and free of charge,  reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other  information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits. This includes  documents with information on medical necessity criteria for both  medical/surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder  benefits, as well as the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards,  and other factors used to apply a nonquantitative treatment limitation  with respect to medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance  use disorder benefits under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Group health plans. The requirements of this  section apply to a group health plan offering medical/surgical benefits  and mental health or substance use disorder benefits. If, under an  arrangement or arrangements to provide medical care benefits by an  employer or employee organization (including for this purpose a joint  board of trustees of a multiemployer trust affiliated with one or more  multiemployer plans), any participant (or beneficiary) can  simultaneously receive coverage for medical/surgical benefits and  coverage for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, then the  requirements of this section (including the exemption provisions in  paragraph (g) of this section) apply separately with respect to each  combination of medical/surgical benefits and of mental health or  substance use disorder benefits that any participant (or beneficiary)  can simultaneously receive from that employer's   or employee organization's arrangement or arrangements to provide  medical care benefits, and all such combinations are considered for  purposes of this section to be a single group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Health insurance issuers. The requirements of this section apply  to a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage for  mental health or substance use disorder benefits in connection with a  group health plan subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Scope. This section does not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Require a group health plan (or health insurance issuer offering  coverage in connection with a group health plan) to provide any mental  health benefits or substance use disorder benefits, and the provision of  benefits by a plan (or health insurance coverage) for one or more mental  health conditions or substance use disorders does not require the plan  or health insurance coverage under this section to provide benefits for  any other mental health condition or substance use disorder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require a group health plan (or health insurance issuer  offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) that provides  coverage for mental health or substance use disorder benefits only to  the extent required under PHS Act section 2713 to provide additional  mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification  in accordance with this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Affect the terms and conditions relating to the amount,  duration, or scope of mental health or substance use disorder benefits  under the plan (or health insurance coverage) except as specifically  provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination with EHB requirements. Nothing in paragraph (f) or  (g) of this section changes the requirements of Sec. Sec. 147.150 and  156.115 of this subchapter, providing that a health insurance issuer  offering non-grandfathered health insurance coverage in the individual  or small group market providing mental health and substance use disorder  services, including behavioral health treatment services, as part of  essential health benefits required under Sec. Sec. 156.110(a)(5) and  156.115(a) of this subchapter, must comply with the provisions of this  section to satisfy the requirement to provide essential health benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Small employer exemption--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The requirements of  this section do not apply to a group health plan (or health insurance  issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) for a  plan year of a small employer (as defined in section 2791 of the PHS  Act).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules in determining employer size. For purposes of paragraph  (f)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All persons treated as a single employer under subsections (b),  (c), (m), and (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code are  treated as one employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an employer was not in existence throughout the preceding  calendar year, whether it is a small employer is determined based on the  average number of employees the employer reasonably expects to employ on  business days during the current calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any reference to an employer for purposes of the small  employer exemption includes a reference to a predecessor of the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Increased cost exemption--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the application of  this section to a group health plan (or health insurance coverage  offered in connection with such plans) results in an increase for the  plan year involved of the actual total cost of coverage with respect to  medical/surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder  benefits as determined and certified under paragraph (g)(3) of this  section by an amount that exceeds the applicable percentage described in  paragraph (g)(2) of this section of the actual total plan costs, the  provisions of this section shall not apply to such plan (or coverage)  during the following plan year, and such exemption shall apply to the  plan (or coverage) for one plan year. An employer or issuer may elect to  continue to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits in  compliance with this section with respect to the plan or coverage  involved regardless of any increase in total costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable percentage. With respect to a plan or coverage, the  applicable percentage described in this paragraph (g) is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 2 percent in the case of the first plan year in which this  section is applied to the plan or coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 1 percent in the case of each subsequent plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determinations by actuaries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determinations as to increases  in actual costs under a plan or coverage that are attributable to  implementation of the requirements of this section shall be made and  certified by a qualified and licensed actuary who is a member in good  standing of the American Academy of Actuaries.
