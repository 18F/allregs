                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial or modified authorizations for BRS stations may not be  granted to a cable operator if a portion of the BRS station's protected  services area is within the portion of the franchise area actually  served by the cable operator's cable system and the cable operator will  be using the BRS station as a multichannel video programming distributor  (as defined in Sec. 76.64(d) of this   chapter). No cable operator may acquire such authorization either  directly, or indirectly through an affiliate owned, operated, or  controlled by or under common control with a cable operator if the cable  operator will use the BRS station as a multichannel video programming  distributor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission  time or capacity to a cable operator either directly, or indirectly  through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common  control with a cable operator, if a portion of the BRS station's  protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area  actually served by the cable operator's cable system the cable operator  will use the BRS station as a multichannel video programming  distributor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications for new stations, station modifications,  assignments or transfers of control by cable operators of BRS stations  shall include a showing that no portion of the GSA of the BRS station is  within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable  operator's cable system, or of any entity indirectly affiliated, owned,  operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable  operator. Alternatively, the cable operator may certify that it will not  use the BRS station to distribute multichannel video programming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other  interests in BRS licensees or cable television systems will be  attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct  ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or  more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS licensee or  cable television system will be cognizable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance  companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in  trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if  they hold 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS  licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers or  directors of the BRS licensee or cable television system are  representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank  concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if  the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock  will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if  under common management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Attribution of ownership interests in a BRS licensee or cable  television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or  more intervening corporations will be determined by successive  multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the  vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution  benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership  percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be  included for purposes of this multiplication. For purposes of paragraph  (d)(9) of this section, attribution of ownership interests in a BRS  licensee or cable television system that are held indirectly by any  party through one or more intervening organizations will be determined  by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link  in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant  attribution benchmark to the resulting product, and the ownership  percentage for any link in the chain that exceeds 50% shall be included  for purposes of this multiplication. For example, except for purposes of  paragraph (d)(9) of this section, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns  60% of company Y, which owns 25% of ``Licensee,'' then X's interest in  ``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same as Y's interest because X's interest  in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x  0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee''  would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable. For  purposes of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, X's interest in  ``Licensee'' would be 15% (0.6 x 0.25) and A's interest in ``Licensee''  would be 1.5% (0.1 x 0.6 x 0.25). Neither interest would be attributed  under paragraph (d)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any  person   who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has  the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right  to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the  trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to  the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as  appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests held in trust.  An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the grantor  or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless all  voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the  relevant BRS licensee or cable television system are subject to said  trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of non- voting stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity.  Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of debt and  instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options or other  non-voting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests shall  not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a  limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly  or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable  television activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so  certifies. An interest in a Limited Liability Company (``LLC'') or  Registered Limited Liability Partnership (``RLLP'') shall be attributed  to the interest holder unless that interest holder is not materially  involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the  BRS or cable television activities of the partnership and the licensee  or system so certifies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a licensee or system that is a limited partnership to make  the certification set forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it  must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited  partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from  attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material  involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of  the BRS or cable television activities of the partnership. For a  licensee or system that is an LLC or RLLP to make the certification set  forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it must verify that the  organizational document, with respect to the particular interest holder  exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt interest holder has  no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or  operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the LLC or RLLP.  Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or  partnership agreement, or other organizational document in the case of  an LLC or RLLP, however, no such certification shall be made if the  individual or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of  any material involvement of the limited partners, or other interest  holders in the case of an LLC or RLLP, in the management or operation of  the BRS or cable television businesses of the partnership or LLC or  RLLP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an LLC or RLLP, the licensee or system seeking  installation shall certify, in addition, that the relevant state statute  authorizing LLCs permits an LLC member to insulate itself as required by  our criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Officers and directors of a BRS licensee or cable television  system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with  which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses  in addition to its primary business of BRS or cable television service,  it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or  director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its  primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a  BRS licensee or cable television system, with an attributable interest  in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable  interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the  officer or director involved are wholly unrelated to the BRS licensee or  cable television system subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting  this fact is submitted to the Commission. The officers and directors of  a sister corporation of a BRS licensee or cable television system shall  not be attributed with ownership of these entities by virtue of such  status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining  whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An  individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive  investors'' is equal to or exceeds 20 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the interests other than those held by or through  ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (d)(8)(i) of  this section plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph  (d)(8)(ii) of this section equal to or exceeds 20 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section,  the holder of an equity or debt interest or interests in a BRS licensee  or cable television system subject to the BRS/cable cross-ownership rule  (``interest holder'') shall have that interest attributed if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or  nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the  aggregate, exceed 33 percent of the total asset value (all equity plus  all debt) of that BRS licensee or cable television system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The interest holder also holds an interest in a BRS licensee or  cable television system that is attributable under this section (other  than this paragraph) and which operates in any portion of the franchise  area served by that cable operator's cable system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The term ``area served by a cable system'' means any area  actually passed by the cable operator's cable system and which can be  connected for a standard connection fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> As used in this section ``cable operator'' shall have the same  definition as in Sec. 76.5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commission will entertain requests to waive the restrictions  in paragraph (a) of this section where necessary to ensure that all  significant portions of the franchise area are able to obtain  multichannel video service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section  will not apply to one BRS channel used to provide locally-produced  programming to cable headends. Locally-produced programming is  programming produced in or near the cable operator's franchise area and  not broadcast on a television station available within that franchise  area. A cable operator will be permitted one BRS channel for this  purpose, and no more than one BRS channel may be used by a cable  television company or its affiliate or lessor pursuant to this  paragraph. The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming  pursuant to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Wireless  Telecommunications Bureau a cover letter explicitly identifying itself  or its lessees as a local cable operator and stating that the lease was  executed to facilitate the provision of local programming. The first  application or the first lease notification in an area filed with the  Commission will be entitled to the exemption. The limitations on one BRS  channel per party and per area include any cable/BRS operations or  cable/EBS operations. The cable operator must demonstrate in its BRS  application that the proposed local programming will be provided within  one year from the date its application is granted. Local programming  service pursuant to a lease must be provided within one year of the date  of the lease or one year of grant of the licensee's application for the  leased channel, whichever is later. If a BRS license for these purposes  is granted and the programming is subsequently discontinued, the license  will be automatically forfeited the day after local programming service  is discontinued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Applications filed by cable television companies, or affiliates,  for BRS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the  prohibitions of this section. Applications filed on February 8, 1990, or  thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS  entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to  February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this  section. Leases between cable television companies, or affiliates, and  BRS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicants executed on  February 8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates, for BRS  channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be   subject to the prohibitions of this section. Except as provided in  paragraph (g)(2)of this section, applications filed on February 8, 1990,  or thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS  entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to  February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this  section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, leases  between cable operators, or affiliates, and BRS/EBS station licensees,  conditional licensees, or applicants executed on or before February 8,  1990, or thereafter are invalid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates for BRS  channels after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not  be subject to the prohibition of this section, if, pursuant to the then  existing overbuild or rural exceptions, the applications were allowed  under the then existing cable/BRS cross-ownership prohibitions. Lease  arrangements between cable operators and BRS entities for which a lease  or firm agreement was signed after February 8, 1990, and prior to  October 5, 1992, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this  section, if, pursuant to the then existing rural and overbuild  exceptions, the lease arrangements were allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The limitations on cable television ownership in this section do  not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable  operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section  623(l) of the Communications Act.
