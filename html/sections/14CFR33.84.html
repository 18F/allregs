                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If approval of a maximum engine overtorque is sought for an engine incorporating a free power turbine, compliance with this section must be demonstrated by testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test may be run as part of the endurance test requirement of Sec. 33.87. Alternatively, tests may be performed

on a complete engine or equivalent testing on individual groups of components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon conclusion of tests conducted to show compliance with this section, each engine part or individual groups of components must meet the requirements of Sec. 33.93(a)(1) and (a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test conditions must be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A total of 15 minutes run at the maximum engine overtorque to be approved. This may be done in separate runs, each being of at least 2\1/2\ minutes duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A power turbine rotational speed equal to the highest speed at which the maximum overtorque can occur in service. The test speed may not be more than the limit speed of take-off or OEI ratings longer than 2 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For engines incorporating a reduction gearbox, a gearbox oil temperature equal to the maximum temperature when the maximum engine overtorque could occur in service; and for all other engines, an oil temperature within the normal operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A turbine entry gas temperature equal to the maximum steady state temperature approved for use during periods longer than 20 seconds when operating at conditions not associated with 30-second or 2 minutes OEI ratings. The requirement to run the test at the maximum approved steady state temperature may be waived by the FAA if the applicant can demonstrate that other testing provides substantiation of the temperature effects when considered in combination with the other parameters identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
