A DX rating must not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol P4 must be used (that is DO-P4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly.

This part must not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception as specified in Sec.  789.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less

than $75,000 or one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see 48 CFR 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems) whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.</p>
