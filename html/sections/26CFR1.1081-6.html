                                Sec. 1.1081-6  Transfers within system group.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The nonrecognition of gain or loss provided for in section  1081(d)(1) is applicable to an exchange of property for other property  (including money and other nonexempt property) between corporations  which are all members of the same system group. The term system group is  defined in section 1083 (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1081 (d)(1) also provides for nonrecognition of gain to  a corporation which is a member of a system group if property (including  money or other nonexempt property) is distributed to such corporation as  a shareholder in a corporation which is a member of the same system  group, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities  in the distributing corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As stated in Sec. 1.1081-2, nonrecognition of gain or loss will  not be accorded to a transaction not clearly provided for in part VI  (section 1081 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code, even  though such transaction occurs simultaneously or in connection with an  exchange, sale, or distribution to which nonrecognition is specifically  accorded. Therefore, nonrecognition will not be accorded to any gain or  loss realized from the discharge, or the removal of the burden, of the  pecuniary obligations of a member of a system group, even though such  obligations are acquired upon a transfer or distribution specifically  described in section 1081 (d)(1); but the fact that the acquisition of  such obligations was upon a transfer or distribution specifically  described in section 1081 (d)(1) will, because of the basis provisions  of section 1082 (d), affect the cost to the member of such discharge or  its equivalent. Thus, section 1081 (d)(1) does not provide for the  nonrecognition of any   gain or loss realized from the discharge of the indebtedness of a member  of a system group as the result of the acquisition in exchange, sale, or  distribution of its own bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness  which were acquired by another member of the same system group for a  consideration less or more than the issuing price thereof (with proper  adjustments for amortization of premiums or discounts).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example: Suppose that the A Corporation and the B Corporation are  both members of the same system group; that the A Corporation holds at a  cost of $900 a bond issued by the B Corporation at par, $1,000; and that  the A Corporation and the B Corporation enter into an exchange subject  to the provisions of section 1081 (d)(1) in which the $1,000 bond of the  B Corporation is transferred from the A Corporation to the B  Corporation. The $900 basis reflecting the cost to the A Corporation  which would have been the basis available to the B Corporation if the  property transferred to it had been something other than its own  securities (see Sec. 1.1082-6) will, in this type of transaction,  reflect the cost to the B Corporation of effecting a retirement of its  own $1,000 bond. The $100 gain of the B Corporation reflected in the  retirement will therefore be recognized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No exchange or distribution may be made without the recognition  of gain or loss as provided for in section 1081 (d)(1), unless all the  corporations which are parties to such exchange or distribution are  acting in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange  Commission. If an exchange or distribution is within the provisions of  section 1081 (d)(1) and also may be considered to be within some other  provisions of section 1081, it shall be considered that only the  provisions of section 1081 (d)(1) apply and that the nonrecognition of  gain or loss upon such exchange or distribution is by virtue of that  section.</p>
