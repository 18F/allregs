                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either or both of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minor changes in previously approved research during the period (of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.

Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of

the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 11.108(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have been approved under the procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.
