                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Personal information should never be placed on shared drives for  access by groups of individuals unless each person has an official need  to know the information to perform their job. Add appropriate access  controls to ensure access by only authorized individuals. Recall rosters  are FOUO because they contain personal information and should be shared  with small groups at the lowest levels for official purposes to reduce  the number of people with access to such personal information.  Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those  individuals with unlisted phone numbers, who do not want their number  included on the office recall roster. In those instances, disclosure to  the Commander or immediate supervisor, or deputy, should normally be  sufficient.</p>
