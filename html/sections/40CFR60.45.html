If the owner or operator  demonstrates during the performance test that emissions of  NOX are less than 70 percent of the applicable standards in  Sec. 60.44, a CEMS for measuring NOX emissions is not  required. If the initial performance test results show that  NOX emissions are greater than 70 percent of the applicable  standard, the owner or operator shall install a CEMS for NOX  within one year after the date of the initial performance tests under  Sec. 60.8 and comply with all other applicable monitoring requirements  under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an owner or operator is not required to and elects not to  install any CEMS for either SO2 or NOX, a CEMS for  measuring either O2 or CO2 is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For affected facilities using a PM CEMS, a bag leak detection  system to   monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) according to the  most current requirements in Sec. 60.48Da of this part, or an ESP  predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in  accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in  section Sec. 60.48Da of this part a COMS is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em>  through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> through (D) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and  operated according to the provisions in Sec. 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb  of this part.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data  points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume  corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be  obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day  rolling average basis.
