                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each distributing agency shall establish a review  system in order to assess the effectiveness of its food distribution  program in meeting the requirements of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibilities of distributing agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As part of its  review system, each distributing agency must establish procedures to  ensure compliance with the requirements of this part, and with other  Federal regulations, as applicable. Such procedures must include, for  example, requirements relating to eligibility of recipient agencies and  recipients, ordering, storage, and inventory of donated foods, reporting  and recordkeeping, and civil rights, as they apply to specific programs.  They must also include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An on-site review of all charitable institutions, or the food  service management companies under contract with them, at a minimum,  whenever the distributing agency identifies actual or probable  deficiencies in the use of donated foods by such institutions, or by  their contractors, through audits, investigations, complaints, or any  other information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An on-site review at least once every 2 years of all processors  except those that are multi-State processors as defined in Sec. 250.3,  with no fewer than 50 percent being reviewed each year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An annual on-site review of each storage facility utilized by  the distributing agency. On-site reviews conducted by FNS may be  considered as contributing to the fulfillment of the minimum coverage  required by this paragraph; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each distributing agency shall design and implement a system to  verify sales of end products to all recipient agencies under that  distributing agency's authority in instances when a processor transfers  end products to a distributor and the distributor sells the end product  to the recipient agencies at a discount and the distributor receives a  refund from the processor. At a minimum, such a system must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At a minimum, provide for a semi-annual review of a  statistically valid sample of sales for the previous six-month period  for all processors which contract with the distributing agency or  contracting agencies under the authority of the distributing agency,  including multi-State processors. The sample size must ensure a 95  percent confidence level;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Support the projection of a claim against the processor when,  in the review of the sample, it is determined that the value of donated  foods has not been passed on to recipient agencies or when end products  have been improperly distributed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide for the assessment of claims against the processor in  accordance with FNS Instruction 410-1, Non-Audit Claims, Food  Distribution Program, in instances when deficiences have been  identified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide for the adjustment of performance reports and  processing inventory reports to refect any invalid sales;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provide for the development and submission by processors to the  distributing agency of a corrective action plan designed to correct  problems identified during the sales verification; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In instances in which the distributing agency has delegated the  responsibility of sales verification to processors, the distributing  agency must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish guidelines which ensure that the criteria contained in  paragraphs (b)(2)(i)-(v) are met;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ensure that processors report their findings to the distributing  agency on a semi-annaul basis in accordance with Sec. 250.30(m);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Review the processor's findings and select a random sub-sample  of at least 10 percent of all sales verified by the processor and  reverify the sale by contacting the recipient agency by telephone or  through written correspondence; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Submit a copy of the processor's review report and findings and  the results of the reverification efforts to the appropriate FNSRO. In  instances of poor processor performance, the distributing agency shall  require the processor to discontinue the abused value pass-through- system, initiate an audit or review to determine the extent to which  sales are to be disallowed, establish a claim, and/or terminate the  contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The distributing agency shall submit a report of review findings  to each   entity reviewed. The report shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each deficiency found;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The factors contributing to each deficiency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Recommendations for needed corrective action, including  timetables for completion and/or claims action to be pursued, if any;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provisions for evaluating effectiveness of corrective actions.  A copy of each processor review report shall be provided to the  appropriate FNSRO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Distributing agencies shall monitor progress toward completion  and the effectiveness of corrective actions taken in eliminating program  deficiences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition to the review requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, each distributing agency shall make a continuing  evaluation of all recipient agencies, and processors by monitoring  performance reports, food requests, participation data, and data  regarding refunds and discounts to recipient agencies and distributors  for the receipt of end products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Distributing agencies shall, where applicable, require that  subdistributing agencies monitor and review their operations in  accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrective action plans. Corrective action plans shall be  submitted whenever a distributing agency is found by the FNSRO to be  substantially out of compliance with a performance standard or any other  provision of this part. The corrective action plan shall identify the  corrective actions and the timeframes needed to correct the deficiencies  found by the FNSRO. The plan shall be written, signed by the proper  official in the State, and submitted to the FNSRO within 60 days after  the distributing agency receives notification from the FNSRO of a  deficiency. Extensions beyond 60 days may be made, for cause, with  written justification to and approved by the FNSRO.
