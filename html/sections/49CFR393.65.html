                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of the rules in this section. The rules in this  section apply to systems for containing and supplying fuel for the  operation of motor vehicles or for the operation of auxiliary equipment  installed on, or used in connection with, motor vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Location. Each fuel system must be located on the motor vehicle  so that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No part of the system extends beyond the widest part of the  vehicle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No part of a fuel tank is forward of the front axle of a power  unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel spilled vertically from a fuel tank while it is being  filled will not contact any part of the exhaust or electrical systems of  the vehicle, except the fuel level indicator assembly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fill pipe openings are located outside the vehicle's passenger  compartment and its cargo compartment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A fuel line does not extend between a towed vehicle and the  vehicle that is towing it while the combination of vehicles is in  motion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No part of the fuel system of a bus manufactured on or after  January 1, 1973, is located within or above the passenger compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuel tank installation. Each fuel tank must be securely attached  to the motor vehicle in a workmanlike manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gravity or syphon feed prohibited. A fuel system must not supply  fuel by gravity or syphon feed directly to the carburetor or injector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Selection control valve location. If a fuel system includes a  selection control valve which is operable by the driver to regulate the  flow of fuel from two or more fuel tanks, the valve must be installed so  that either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The driver may operate it while watching the roadway and without  leaving his/her driving position; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The driver must stop the vehicle and leave his/her seat in order  to operate the valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fuel lines. A fuel line which is not completely enclosed in a  protective housing must not extend more than 2 inches below the fuel  tank or its sump. Diesel fuel crossover, return, and withdrawal lines  which extend below the bottom of the tank or sump must be protected  against damage from impact. Every fuel line must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Long enough and flexible enough to accommodate normal movements  of the parts to which it is attached without incurring damage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secured against chafing, kinking, or other causes of mechanical  damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Excess flow valve. When pressure devices are used to force fuel  from a fuel tank, a device which prevents the flow of fuel from the fuel  tank if the fuel feed line is broken must be installed in the fuel  system.
