                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tolerances established in this part are based upon residues of  drugs in edible products of food-producing animals treated with such  drugs. Consideration of an appropriate tolerance for a drug shall result  in a conclusion either that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Finite residues will be present in the edible products--in which  case a finite tolerance is required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not possible to determine whether finite residues will be  incurred but there is reasonable expectation that they may be present-- in which case a tolerance for negligible residue is required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, after  tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of such  drug, has been shown to induce cancer in man or animal; however, such  drug will not adversely affect the animals for which it is intended, and  no residue of such drug will be found by prescribed methods of analysis  in any edible portion of such animals after slaughter or in any food  yielded by or derived from the living animal--in which case the accepted  method of analysis shall be published or cited, if previously published  and available elsewhere, in this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It may or may not be possible to determine whether finite  residues will be incurred but there is no reasonable expectation that  they may be present--in which case the establishment of a tolerance is  not required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The drug is such that it may be metabolized and/or assimilated  in such form that any possible residue would be indistinguishable from  normal tissue constituents--in which case the establishment of a  tolerance is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No tolerance established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this  section will be set at any level higher than that reflected by the  permitted use of the drug.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any tolerance required pursuant to this section will, in  addition to the toxicological considerations, be conditioned on the  availability of a practicable analytical method to determine the  quantity of residue. Such method must be sensitive to and reliable at  the established tolerance level or, in certain instances, may be  sensitive at a higher level where such level is also deemed satisfactory  and safe in light of the toxicity of the drug residue and of the  unlikelihood of such residue's exceeding the tolerance.</p>
