                                Sec. 1955.122  Method of sale (chattel).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Acquired chattels will be sold as expeditiously as possible using  the method(s) considered most appropriate. If the chattel is not sold  within 180 days after acquisition, assistance will be requested as  outlined in Sec. 1955.143 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sale to beginning farmers or ranchers. Beginning farmers or  ranchers obtaining special OL loan assistance under Sec. 1941.15 of  subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter will receive priority in the  purchase of farm equipment held in government inventory during the  commitment period. The County Supervisor will notify such applicants/ borrowers of any farm equipment held in government inventory within the  service area of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 County Office. These applicants/borrowers will be given 10 working  days to respond that they are interested in purchasing any or all items  of equipment at the appraised fair market value established by FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 Form Letter 1955-C-1 will be used to  notify applicants/borrowers of the availability of farm equipment in  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 inventory. The  equipment must be essential to the success of the operation described in  the loan application in order for the applicant to have an opportunity  to purchase such equipment. The County Supervisor will determine what  equipment is essential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regular sale. Chattels will be sold by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 employees at market value to program  applicants. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  440-21, ``Appraisal of Chattel Property,'' will be used when appraising  chattels for regular sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Auctions. Section 1955.148 of this subpart provides detailed  guidance on auctions applicable to the sale of chattels, as supplemented  by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Established public auction. An established public auction is an  auction that is widely advertised and held on a regularly scheduled  basis at the same facility. This method of sale is particularly suited  for the sale of commodities, farm machinery and livestock. No additional  public notice of sale is required other than that commonly used by the  facility. This is the preferred method of disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other auctions. Other auctions, whether conducted by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees or fee auctioneers,  are suitable for on-premises sales, for sale of dissimilar chattels, and  for the sale of chattels in conjunction with the auction of real  property. A minimum of 5 days public notice will be given prior to the  date of auction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sealed bid sales. Section 1955.147 of this subpart provides  detailed guidance on sealed bid sales applicable to the sale of  chattels. When it is believed that financing will have to be provided   through a credit sale, this method has advantages over auction sales. It  requires, however, additional steps in the event any established minimum  price is not obtained. Preference will be given to a cash offer which is  at least ----* percent of the highest offer requiring credit.</p><p class="depth2">[* Refer to exhibit B of FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 Instruction 440.1 (available in any FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 office) for the current percentage.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Negotiated sale. Perishable acquired items and crops (except  timber) and chattels for which no acceptable bid was received from  auction or sealed bid methods may be sold by direct negotiation for the  best price obtainable. No public notice is required to negotiate with  interested parties including prior bidders. Justification for the use of  this method of sale will be documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification. In many States the original owner of the chattel  property must personally be notified of the sale date and method of sale  within a certain time prior to the sale. The State Director then will  issue a State supplement clearly stating what notices are to be sent, if  any. County Supervisor will review State supplements to determine what  notices must be sent to the previous owner of the chattel property prior  to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 taking action  to sell the property.  No public notice is required to negotiate with interested parties  including prior bidders. Justification for the use of this method of  sale will be documented. A copy of the sale instrument (Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1955-47, ``Bill of Sale `A'-- Sale of Government Property'') will be kept in the County or District  Office inventory file. Sale proceeds will be remitted according to FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1951-B  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  office). A State Supplement, when needed, will be prepared with the  assistance of OGC to provide additional guidance on negotiated sales and  to insure compliance with State laws.
