                            <p class="depth0">Although a formal petition is necessary to obtain an advisory  opinion from the Board, other avenues are available to persons seeking  informal and, in most cases, speedy opinions on jurisdictional issues.  In discussion of jurisdictional questions informally with Regional  Office personnel, information and advice concerning the Board's  jurisdictional standards may be obtained. Such practices are not  intended to be discouraged by the rules providing for formal advisory  opinions by the Board, although the opinions expressed by such personnel  are not to be regarded as binding upon the Board or the General Counsel.</p>
