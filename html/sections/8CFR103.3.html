For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 103.4 and 103.5 of this part, affected party (in addition to the Service) means the person or entity with legal standing in a proceeding.

In that instance, the official who has jurisdiction over such a proceeding in that geographic location shall review it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Favorable action instead of forwarding appeal to AAU. The reviewing official shall decide whether or not favorable action is warranted. Within 45 days of receipt of the appeal, the reviewing official may treat the appeal as a motion to reopen or reconsider and take favorable action. However, that official is not precluded from reopening a proceeding or reconsidering a decision on his or her own motion under Sec. 103.5(a)(5)(i) of this part in order to make a new decision favorable to the affected party after 45 days of receipt of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Forwarding appeal to AAU.

In such a case, any filing fee the Service has accepted will not be refunded regardless of the action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When favorable action warranted. If the reviewing official decides favorable action is warranted with respect to an otherwise properly filed appeal, that official shall ask the attorney or representative to submit Form G-28 to the official's office within 15 days of the request.

An appeal which is not filed within the time allowed must be rejected as improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee the Service has accepted will not be refunded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Untimely appeal treated as motion. If an untimely appeal meets the requirements of a motion to reopen as described in Sec. 103.5(a)(2) of this part or a motion to reconsider as described in Sec. 103.5(a)(3) of this part, the appeal must be treated as a motion, and a decision must be made on the merits of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Brief. The affected party may submit a brief with Form I-290B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Additional time to submit a brief.
