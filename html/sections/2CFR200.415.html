I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect (F&A;) cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect (F&A;) cost rate proposal must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect (F&A;) cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the non-Federal entity, must be certified by the non-Federal entity using the Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan or Certificate of Indirect Costs as set forth in Appendices III through VII, and Appendix IX. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the non-Federal entity by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer of the non-Federal entity that submits the proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the non-Federal entity has elected the option under Sec. 200.414 Indirect (F&A;) costs, paragraph (f), the Federal Government may either disallow all indirect (F&A;) costs or unilaterally establish such a plan or rate when the non-Federal entity fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing such a plan or rate in accordance with the requirements. Such a plan or rate may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When a cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate is unilaterally established by the Federal Government because the non-Federal entity failed to submit a certified proposal, the plan or rate established will be set to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certifications by non-profit organizations as appropriate that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization as defined in Sec. 200.414 Indirect (F&A;) costs, paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> See also Sec. 200.450 Lobbying for another required certification.
