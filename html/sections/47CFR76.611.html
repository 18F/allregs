                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No cable television system shall commence or provide service in  the frequency bands 108-137 and 225-400 MHz unless such systems is in  compliance with one of the following cable television basic signal  leakage performance criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and  at least once each calendar year, with no more than 12 months between  successive tests thereafter, based on a sampling of at least 75% of the  cable strand, and including any portion of the cable system which are  known to have or can reasonably be expected to have less leakage  integrity than the average of the system, the cable operator  demonstrates compliance with a cumulative signal leakage index by  showing either that (i) 10 log I3000 is equal to or less than  -7 or (ii) 10 log I00 is equal to or less than 64, using one  of the following formula:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  where:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  ri is the distance (in meters) between the leakage source and</p><p class="depth3">the center of the cable television system; [thetas] is the fraction of the system cable length actually examined</p><p class="depth3">for leakage sources and is equal to the strand kilometers</p><p class="depth3">(strand miles) of plant tested divided by the total strand</p><p class="depth3">kilometers (strand miles) in the plant; Ri is the slant height distance (in meters) from leakage</p><p class="depth3">source i to a point 3000 meters above the center of the cable</p><p class="depth3">television system; Ei is the electric field strength in microvolts per meter</p><p class="depth3"><em>([micro]V/m)</em> measured pursuant to Sec.  76.609(h) 3 meters</p><p class="depth3">from the leak i; and n is the number of leaks found of field strength equal to or greater</p><p class="depth3">than 50 [micro]V/m pursuant to Section 76.609(h).   The sum is carried over all leaks i detected in the cable examined; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and  at least   once each calendar year, with no more than 12 months between successive  tests thereafter, the cable operator demonstrates by measurement in the  airspace that at no point does the field strength generated by the cable  system exceed 10 microvolts per meter ([micro]V/m) RMS at an altitude of  450 meters above the average terrain of the cable system. The  measurement system (including the receiving antenna) shall be calibrated  against a known field of 10 [micro]V/m RMS produced by a well  characterized antenna consisting of orthogonal reasonant dipoles, both  parallel to and one quarter wavelength above the ground plane of a  diameter of two meters or more at ground level. The dipoles shall have  centers collocated and be excited 90 degrees apart. The half-power  bandwidth of the detector shall be 25 kHz. If an aeronautical receiver  is used for this purpose it shall meet the standards of the Radio  Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RCTA) for aeronautical  communications receivers. The aircraft antenna shall be horizontally  polarized. Calibration shall be made in the community unit or, if more  than one, in any of the community units of the physical system within a  reasonable time period to performing the measurements. If data is  recorded digitally the 90th percentile level of points recorded over the  cable system shall not exceed 10 [micro]V/m RMS; if analog recordings is  used the peak values of the curves, when smoothed according to good  engineering practices, shall not exceed 10 [micro]V/m RMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section the unmodulated  test signal used on the cable plant shall: (1) Be within the VHF  aeronautical band 108-137 MHz or any other frequency in which the  results can be correlated to the VHF aeronautical band and (2) have an  average power level equal to the average power level of the strongest  cable television carrier on the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section, if a modulated test  signal is used, the test signal and detector technique must, when  considered together, yield the same result as though an unmodulated test  signal were used in conjunction with a detection technique which would  yield the RMS value of said unmodulated carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a sampling of at least 75% of the cable strand (and including  any portions of the cable system which are known to have or can  reasonably be expected to have less leakage integrity than the average  of the system) as described in paragraph (a)(1) cannot be obtained by  the cable operator or is otherwise not reasonably feasible, the cable  operator shall perform the airspace measurements described in paragraph  (a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior to providing service to any subscriber on a new section of  cable plant, the operator shall show compliance with either: (1) The  basic signal leakage criteria in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or  (a)(2) of this section for the entire plant in operation or (2) a  showing shall be made indicating that no individual leak in the new  section of the plant exceeds 20 [micro]V/m at 3 meters in accordance  with Sec.  76.609 fo the Rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a cable operator  shall be permitted to operate on any frequency which is offset pursuant  to Sec.  76.612 in the frequency band 108-137 MHz for the purpose of  demonstrating compliance with the cable television basic signal leakage  performance criteria.
