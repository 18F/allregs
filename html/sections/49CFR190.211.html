                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section applies to hearings conducted under this  part relating to civil penalty assessments, compliance orders, orders  directing amendment, safety orders, and corrective action orders. The  Presiding Official will convene hearings conducted under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearing request and statement of issues. A request for a hearing  must be accompanied by a statement of the issues that the respondent  intends to raise at the hearing. The issues may relate to the  allegations in the notice, the proposed corrective action, or the  proposed civil penalty amount. A respondent's failure to specify an  issue may result in waiver of the respondent's right to raise that issue  at the hearing. The respondent's request must also indicate whether or  not the respondent will be represented by counsel at the hearing. The  respondent may withdraw a request for a hearing in writing and provide a  written response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Telephonic and in-person hearings. A telephone hearing will be  held if the amount of the proposed civil penalty or the cost of the  proposed corrective action is less than $25,000, unless the respondent  or OPS submits a written request for an in-person hearing. In-person  hearings will normally be held at the office of the appropriate OPS  Region. Hearings may be held by video teleconference if the necessary  equipment is available to all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pre-hearing submissions. If OPS or the respondent intends to  introduce material, including records, documents, and other exhibits not  already in the case file, the material must be submitted to the  Presiding Official and the other party at least 10 days prior to the  date of the hearing, unless the Presiding Official sets a different  deadline or waives the deadline for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conduct of the hearing. The hearing is conducted informally  without strict adherence to rules of evidence. The Presiding Official  regulates the course of the hearing and gives each party an opportunity  to offer facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other  evidence that is relevant and material to the issues under  consideration. The parties may call witnesses on their own behalf and  examine the evidence and witnesses presented by the other party. After  the evidence in the case has been presented, the Presiding Official will  permit reasonable discussion of the issues under consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Written transcripts. If a respondent elects to transcribe a  hearing, the respondent must make arrangements with a court reporter at  cost to the respondent and submit a complete copy of the transcript for  the case file. The respondent must notify the Presiding Official in  advance if it intends to transcribe a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Post-hearing submission. The respondent and OPS may request an  opportunity to submit further written material after the hearing for  inclusion in the record. The Presiding Official will allow a reasonable  time for the submission of the material and will specify the submission  date. If the material is not submitted within the time prescribed, the  case will proceed to final action without the material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Preparation of decision. After consideration of the case file,  the Presiding Official prepares a recommended decision in the case,  which is then forwarded to the Associate Administrator for issuance of a  final order.
