                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Use of a flare. When a flare is used to comply with Sec. 63.487(a)(1) or Sec. 63.487(b)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with Sec. 63.504(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions to performance tests. An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test when a control device specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section is used to comply with Sec. 63.487(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A control device for which a performance test was conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA and the test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section and either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Batch front-end process vent testing and procedures for compliance with Sec. 63.487(a)(2). Except as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, an owner or operator using a control device to comply with Sec. 63.487(a)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in order to determine the control efficiency of the control device. An owner or operator shall determine the percent reduction for the batch cycle using the control efficiency of the control device as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either total organic HAP or TOC. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``batch emission episode'' shall have the meaning ``period of the batch emission episode selected for control,'' which may be the entire batch emission episode or may only be a portion of the batch emission episode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a test shall be performed for the entire period of each batch emission episode in the batch cycle that the owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 90 percent emission reduction for the batch cycle specified in Sec. 63.487(a)(2). Only one test is required for each batch emission episode selected by the owner or operator for control. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B) through (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Alternatively, an owner or operator may choose to test only those periods of the batch emission episode during which the emission rate for the entire episode can be determined or during which the emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate

that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used, provided the results are still relevant to the current batch front-end process vent conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube, except that references to particulate matter in Method 1A do not apply for the purposes of this subpart. No traverse is necessary when Method 2A or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is used to determine gas stream volumetric flow rate. Inlet sampling sites shall be located as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section. Outlet sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of the final control device prior to release to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the exit from the batch unit operation before any control device. Section 63.488(a)(2) describes those recovery devices considered part of the unit operation. Inlet sampling sites would be after these specified recovery devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all batch front-end process vents and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Gas stream volumetric flow rate and/or average batch vent flow rate shall be determined as specified in Sec. 63.488(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration of organic HAP or TOC, as appropriate. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(D)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an integrated sample is taken over the entire batch emission episode to determine the average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 18 and 19.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JN00.014

The batch mass input limitation shall be determined using the same basis, as described in Sec. 63.488(a)(1), used to make the group determination (i.e., expected mix of products or highest-HAP recipe). The establishment of the batch mass input limitation is not dependent upon any past production or activity level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the expected mix of products serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based on any foreseeable combination of products that the owner or operator expects to manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the single highest-HAP recipe serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based solely on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe, considering all

products produced or processed in the batch unit operation.
