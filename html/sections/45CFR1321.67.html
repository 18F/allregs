State agencies, in developing State eligibility criteria for in-home services under section 343 of the Act, may not include a means test as an eligibility criterion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A service provider that receives funds under this part may not deny any older person a service because the older person will not or cannot contribute to the cost of the service.</p>
