L. 106-107).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The OMB guidance in its initial form--before completion of revisions described in paragraph (b) of this section--is published in chapter II of this subtitle. When revisions to a part of the guidance are finalized, that part is published in chapter I and removed from chapter II.</p>
