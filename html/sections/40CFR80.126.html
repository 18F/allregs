                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this subpart F:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Averaging compliance records shall include the calculations used to determine compliance with relevant standards on average, for each averaging period and for each quantity of gasoline for which standards must be achieved separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit Trading Records. Credit trading records shall include worksheets and EPA reports showing actual and complying totals for benzene; credit calculation worksheets; contracts; letter agreements; and invoices and other documentation evidencing the transfer of credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation records shall include laboratory analysis reports that identify whether gasoline meets the requirements for a given designation; operational and accounting reports of product storage; and product transfer documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Oxygenate blender records shall include laboratory analysis reports; refiner, importer and oxygenate blender contracts; quality assurance program records; product transfer documents; oxygenate purchasing, inventory, and usage records; and daily tank inventory gauging reports, meter tickets, and product transfer documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Product transfer documents means copies of documents represented by the refiner/importer/oxygenate blender as having been provided to the transferee, and that reflect the transfer of ownership or physical custody of gasoline or blendstock (e.g., invoices, receipts, bills of lading, manifests, and/or pipeline tickets).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tender means the transfer of ownership or physical custody of a volume of gasoline or other petroleum product all of which has the same identification (reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, and other non-finished-gasoline petroleum products), and characteristics (time and place of use restrictions for reformulated gasoline and RBOB).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Volume records shall include summaries of gasoline produced or imported that account for the volume of each type of gasoline produced or imported. The volumes shall be based on tank gauges or meter reports and temperature adjusted to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Attestor means the CPA or CIA performing the agreed-upon procedures engagement under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Foot (or crossfoot) means to add a series of numbers, generally in columns (or rows), to a total amount. When applying the attestation procedures in this subpart F, the attestor may foot to subtotals on a sample basis in those instances where subtotals (e.g., page totals) exist. In such instances, the total should be footed from the subtotals and the subtotals should be footed on a test basis using no less than 25% of the subtotals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Laboratory Analysis means the original test result for each analysis that was used to determine a product's properties. For laboratories using test methods that must be correlated to the standard test method, the correlation factors and results shall be included as part of the laboratory analysis. For refineries or importers that produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB and use the 100% independent lab testing, the laboratory analysis shall consist of the results reported to the refinery or importer by the independent lab. Where assumed properties used (e.g., for butane) the assumed properties may serve as the test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Non-finished-gasoline petroleum products means liquid petroleum products that have boiling ranges greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but less than 450 degrees Fahrenheit, as per ASTM D 86 or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Reporting period means the time period relating to the reports filed with EPA by the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender, and generally is the calendar year.
