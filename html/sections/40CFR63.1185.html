The average  of the three one-hour performance test runs establishes the temperature  level to use to monitor compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To comply with the requirements for maintaining the operating  temperature of an incinerator after the performance test, you must  measure and record the average operating temperature of the incinerator  as required by Sec. Sec.  63.1182 and 63.1183 of this subpart. This  average operating temperature of the incinerator is based on the  arithmetic average of the one-hour average temperatures for each  consecutive three-hour period and is determined in the same manner  described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.</p>
