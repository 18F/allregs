For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20  per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78  per hour ($20.00 x 40/45 = $17.78).</p><p class="depth0">Child care services means child protective services (including the  investigation of child abuse and neglect reports), social services,  health and mental health care, child (day) care, education (whether or  not directly involved in teaching), foster care, residential care,  recreational or rehabilitative programs, and detention, correctional, or  treatment services.</p><p class="depth0">Nonpersonal services contract means a contract under which the  personnel rendering the services are not subject, either by the  contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the  supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the  Government and its employees.</p><p class="depth0">Performance-based contracting means structuring all aspects of an  acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed as opposed to  either the manner by which the work is to be performed or broad and  imprecise statements of work.</p><p class="depth0">Service contract means a contract that directly engages the time and  effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an  identifiable task rather than to furnish an end item of supply.
