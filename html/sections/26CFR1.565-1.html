                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consent dividends. The dividends paid deduction, as defined in  section 561, includes the consent dividends for the taxable year. A  consent dividend is a hypothetical distribution (as distinguished from  an actual distribution) made by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A corporation that has a reasonable basis to believe that it is  subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed in part I of subchapter  G, chapter 1 of the Code, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section, by filing a consent at the time and in the manner specified in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Making and filing of consents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A consent shall be made on  Form 972 in accordance with this section and the instructions on the  form issued therewith. It may be made only by or on behalf of a person  who was the actual owner on the last day of the corporation's taxable  year of any class of consent stock, that is, the person who would have  been required to include in gross income any dividends on such stock  actually distributed on the last day of such year. Form 972 shall  contain or be verified by a written declaration that it is made under  the penalties of perjury. In the consent such person must agree to  include in gross income for his taxable year in which or with which the  taxable year of the corporation ends a specific amount as a taxable  dividend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> See paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 1.565-2 for the rules  as to when all or a portion of the amount so specified will be  disregarded for tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A consent may be filed at any time not later than the due date  (including extensions) of the corporation's income tax return for the  taxable year for which the dividends paid deduction is claimed. With  such return, and not later than the due date (including extensions)  thereof, the corporation must file Forms 972 for each consenting  shareholder, and a return on Form 973 showing by classes the stock  outstanding on the first and last days of the taxable year, the dividend  rights of such stock, distributions made during the taxable year to  shareholders, and giving all the other information required by the form.  For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, the Form 973 filed  with the corporation's income tax return shall contain or be verified by  a written declaration that is made under the penalties of perjury and  the Forms 972 filed with the return must be duly executed by the  consenting shareholders. For taxable years beginning after December 31,  2002, the Form 973 filed with the corporation's income tax return shall  be verified by signing the return and the Forms 972 filed with the  return must be duly executed by the consenting shareholders or, if  unsigned, must contain the same information as the duly executed  originals. If the corporation submits unsigned Forms 972 with its return  for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, the duly executed  originals are records that the corporation must retain and keep  available for inspection in the manner required by Sec. 1.6001-1(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Taxability of amounts specified in consents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The filing of a  consent is irrevocable, and except as otherwise provided in section  565(b), Sec. 1.565-2, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the full  amount specified in a consent filed by a shareholder of a corporation  described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be included in the  gross income of the shareholder as a taxable dividend. Where the  shareholder is taxable on a dividend only if received from sources  within the United States, the amount specified in the consent of the  shareholder shall be treated as a dividend from sources within the  United States in the same manner as if the dividend has been paid in  money to the shareholder on the last day of the corporation's taxable  year. See paragraph (b) of this section relating to the making and  filing of consents, and section 565(e) and Sec. 1.565-5, with respect to  the payment requirement in the case of nonresident aliens and foreign  corporations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of  this section, to the extent that the Commissioner determines that the  amount specified in a consent is larger than the amount of earnings  subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed by part I of subchapter  G, such excess is not a consent dividend under paragraph (a) of this  section and will not be included in the gross income of the shareholder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in section 565(b), Sec. 1.565-2 and paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, once a shareholder's consent is filed, the full  amount specified in such consent must be included in the shareholder's  gross income as a taxable dividend, and the ground upon which a  deduction for consent dividends is denied the corporation does not  affect the taxability of a shareholder whose consent has been filed for  the amount specified in the consent. For example, although described in  part I, II, or III of subchapter G, or part I or II of subchapter M,  chapter 1 of the Code, the corporation's taxable income (as adjusted  under section 535(b), 545(b), 556(b), 852(b)(2), or 857(b)(2), as  appropriate) may be less than the total of the consent dividends.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A shareholder who is a nonresident alien or a foreign  corporation is taxable on the full amount of the consent dividend that  otherwise qualifies under this section even though that payment has not  been made as required by section 565(e) and Sec. 1.565-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Income of a foreign corporation is not subject to the tax on  accumulated earnings under part I of subchapter G,   chapter 1 of the Code except to the extent of U.S. source income,  adjusted as permitted under section 535. See section 535 (b) and (d) and  Sec. 1.535-1(b). Therefore, foreign source earnings (other than those  distributions subject to resourcing under section 535(d)) of a foreign  corporation that is not described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  cannot qualify for consent dividend treatment. Accordingly, a consent  dividend made by a foreign corporation described in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section shall not be effective with respect to all of the  corporation's earnings, but shall relate solely to earnings which would  have been, in the absence of the consent dividend, subject to the  accumulated earnings tax.
