                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of Executive T, Eighty-second Congress, second session, an agreement between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of their Forces, signed at London on June 19, 1951. It is the understanding of the Senate, which understanding inheres in its advise and consent to the ratification of the Agreement, that nothing in the Agreement diminishes, abridges, or alters the right of the United States of America to safeguard its own security by excluding or removing persons whose presence in the United States is deemed prejudicial to its safety or security, and that no person whose presence in the United States is deemed prejudicial to its safety or security shall be permitted to enter or remain in the United States. In giving its advise and consent to ratification, it is the sense of the Senate that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The criminal jurisdiction provisions of Article VII do not constitute a precedent for future agreements;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a person subject to the military jurisdiction of the United States is to be tried by the authorities of a receiving state, under the treaty the Commanding Officer of the armed forces of the United States in such state shall examine the laws of such state with particular reference to the procedural safeguards contained in the Constitution of the United States;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, in the opinion of such Commanding Officer, under all the circumstances of the case, there is danger that the accused will not be protected becase of the absence or denial of constitutional rights the accused would enjoy in the United States, the Commanding Officer shall request the authorities of the receiving State to waive jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3(c) of Article VII (which requires the receiving

State to give ``sympathetic consideration'' to such request) and if such authorities refuse to waive jurisdiction, the commanding officer shall request the Department of State to press such request through diplomatic channels and notification shall be given by the Executive Branch to the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A representative of the United States to be appointed by the Chief of Diplomatic Mission with the advice of the senior U.S. military representative in the receiving State will attend the trial of any such person by the authorities of a receiving State under the agreement, and any failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph 9 of Article VII of the Agreement shall be reported to the commanding officer of the Armed Forces of the United States in such State who shall then request the Department of State to take appropriate action to protect the rights of the accused, and notification shall be given by the Executive Branch to the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
