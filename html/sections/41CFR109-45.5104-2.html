                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted in  accordance with the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally, all sales of foreign surplus personal property shall  be conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous  and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive  bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers  shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous  to the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In no event shall any personal property be sold in foreign areas  without a condition which states that its importation into the United  States is forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (in the  case of any agricultural commodity, food, cotton, or woolen goods), or  the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other property), has  determined that the importation of such property would relieve domestic  shortages or otherwise be beneficial to the economy of the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any  import duties or taxes levied against personal property sold in the  country involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax  shall not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government  for the personal property. In the event the levy is placed upon the  seller by law, the buyer will be required to pay all such duties or  taxes and furnish the seller copies of his receipts prior to the release  of the personal property to him. However, if the foreign government  involved will not accept payment from the buyer, the seller will collect  the duties or taxes and turn the amounts collected over to the foreign  government. Accounting for the amounts collected shall be coordinated  with the disbursing officer of the nearest United States foreign service  post. The property shall not be released to the purchaser until the  disposal officer is satisfied that there is no responsibility for  payment by the United States (as contrasted to collection by the United  States) of taxes, duties, excises, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certain categories of personal property, including small arms  and machine guns; artillery and projectiles; ammunition, bombs,  torpedoes, rockets and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range  finders; tanks and ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents,  propellants and explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment;  aircraft and all components, parts and accessories for aircraft;  military electronic equipment; aerial cameras, military photo- interpretation, stereoscopic plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and  all material not enumerated which is included in the United States  Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01, and is subject to disposal restrictions.  Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department for the sale  of all such articles. Therefore, prior to the sale of any of the  articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign service post  in the area shall be consulted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior to the sale of personal property which has a total  acquisition cost of $250,000 or more, plans for such sale shall be  reported to the DPMO with ample time to allow consideration of possible  foreign policy issues and advice thereon from the State Department (see  section 109-45.5106(a) of this subpart). All proposed sales, regardless  of the total acquisition cost of the personal property involved, which  the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a significant  economic or political impact in a particular area, shall be discussed  with the foreign service post.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign  surplus personal property, such authority shall be exercised only when  such action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government.  Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals  by sale under Sec. 109-45.5105-2(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foreign excess or surplus personal property (including  salvage and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of  its care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A written finding to that effect is made and approved by the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and  Investment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No personal property shall be abandoned or destroyed if donation  is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to any agency  of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health, or charitable  nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign excess personal property may also be abandoned or  destroyed when such action is required by military necessity, safety, or  considerations of health or security. A written statement explaining the  basis for disposal by these means and approval by the Deputy Assistant  Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and Investment is  required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Property shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which  is detrimental or dangerous to public health and safety, or which will  cause infringement on the rights of other persons.</p>
