                                Sec. 2005.2  Requests for access.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to gain  access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained  by STR must submit their request in writing in accordance with the  procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Individuals who  are employed by the STR may make their request on a regularly scheduled  workday (Monday through Friday, excluding legal Federal holidays)  between the hours of 9 am and 5:30 pm. Such requests for access by  individuals employed by STR need not be made in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Content of the request. The request for access  to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the  Administrative Officer at the address cited above, and shall name the  system of records or contain a description (as concise as possible) of  such system of records. The request should state that the request is  pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of such a statement,  if the request is for a record pertaining to the person requesting  access which is maintained by STR in a system of records, the request  will be presumed to be made under the Privacy Act of 1974. The request  should contain necessary information to verify the identity of the  person requesting access (see paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section). In  addition, such person should include any other information which may  assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is  being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.) as well  as any other identifying information contained in and required by the  STR Notice of Systems of Records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the request for access follows a prior request under Sec.  2005.1, the same identifying information need not be included in the  request for access if a reference is made to that prior correspondence  or a copy of the STR response to that request is attached. If the  individual specifically desires a copy of the record, the request should  so specify under Sec. 2005.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> STR action on request. A request for access will ordinarily be  answered within 10 days, except when the Administrative Officer  determines otherwise, in which case the person making the request will  be informed of the reasons for the delay and an estimated date by which  the request will be answered. When the request can be answered within 10  days, it shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that there is a record as request or a statement  that there is not a record in the systems of records maintained by STR;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement as to whether access will be granted only by  providing a copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the  location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In  the event the person requesting access is unable to meet the   specified date and time, alternative arrangements may be made with the  official specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will  be the sole means of granting access only when the Administrative  Officer has determined that it would not unduly impede the right of  access of the person making the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of fees charged, if any (see Sec. Sec. 2005.6 and  2005.7). (Fees are applicable only to requests for copies);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name, title, and telephone number of the STR official having  operational control over the record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The documentation required by STR to verify the identity of the  person making the request. At a minimum, STR verification standards  include the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Current or former STR Employees. Current or former STR employees  requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records  maintained by STR may, in addition to the other requirements of this  section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational  control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual  observation. If the current or former STR employee cannot be so  identified by the official having operational control over the records,  identification documentation will be required. Employee identification  cards, annuitant identification, driver licenses, or the ``employee  copy'' of any official personnel document in the record are examples of  acceptable identification validation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other than current or former STR employees. Individuals other  than current or former STR employees requesting access to a record  pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by STR must produce  identification documentation of the type described in paragraph  (b)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, prior to being granted access. The extent  of the identification documentation required will depend on the type of  record for which access is requested. In most cases, identification  verification will be accomplished by the presentation of two forms of  identification. Any additional requirements will be specified in the  system notices published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Access granted by mail. For records to be made accessible by  mail, the Administrative Officer shall, to the extent possible,  establish identity by a comparison of signatures in situations where the  data in the record is not so sensitive that unauthorized access could  cause harm or embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No  identification documentation will be required for the disclosure to the  person making the request of information required to be made available  to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552. When, in the opinion of the  Administrative Officer the granting of access through the mail could  reasonably be expected to result in harm or embarrassment if disclosed  to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains, a  notarized statement of identity or some similar assurance of identity  will be required.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Unavailability of identification documentation. If an individual  is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the  individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and  acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to  records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine  of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the  records to which access is sought, the official having operational  control over the records may require such further reasonable assurances  as may be considered appropriate; e.g., statements of other individuals  who can attest to the identity of the person making the request.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Access by the parent of a minor, or by a legal guardian. A  parent of a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may  act on behalf of the minor to gain access to any record pertaining to  the minor maintained by STR in a system of records. A legal guardian may  similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due  to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent  jurisdiction, upon the presentation of the documents authorizing the  legal guardian to so act, and upon   suitable personal identification of the guardian.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Granting access when accompanied by another individual. When an  individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records  maintained by STR wishes to be accompanied by another individual during  the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the  request shall submit to the official having operational control of the  record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Denial of access for inadequate identification documentation. If  the official having operation control over the records in a system of  records maintained by STR determines that an individual seeking access  has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit  access, the official shall consult with the Administrative officer prior  to finally denying the individual access.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Medical records. The records in a system of records which are  medical records shall be disclosed to the individual to whom they  pertain in such manner and following such procedures as the  Administrative Officer shall direct. When STR in consultation with a  physician, determines that the disclosure of medical information could  have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, STR may  transmit such information to a physician named by the individual.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Exceptions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to  entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in  reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceedings.</p>
