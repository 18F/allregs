Documentation shall be prepared and recorded that presents the information used as the basis for the owner's or operator's knowledge that the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the off-site material is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit listed in Table 3, Table 4, or Table 5 of this subpart for the applicable tank design capacity category. Examples of information that may be used include: the off-site material is generated by a process for which at other locations it previously has been determined by direct measurement that the off-site material maximum HAP vapor pressure is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit for the appropriate tank design capacity category. In the event that the Administrator and the owner or operator disagree on a determination of the maximum HAP vapor pressure for an off-site material stream using knowledge, then the results from a determination of HAP vapor pressure using direct measurement as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall be used to establish compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. The Administrator may perform or require that the owner or operator perform this determination using direct measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 shall be for the weighted average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit at the time of monitoring, not for each individual organic constituent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Calibration gases shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppmv.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (k)(8)(i) or (k)(8)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (k)(9)(i) and (k)(9)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic

emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Control device performance test procedures. Performance tests shall be based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) and shall exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites at the inlet and outlet of the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To determine compliance with a control device percent reduction requirement, sampling sites shall be located at the inlet of the control device as specified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i)(A) and (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and at the outlet of the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The control device inlet sampling site shall be located after the final product recovery device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a vent stream is introduced with the combustion air or as an auxiliary fuel into a boiler or process heater, the location of the inlet sampling sites shall be selected to ensure that the measurement of total HAP concentration or TOC concentration, as applicable, includes all vent streams and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine compliance with an enclosed combustion device concentration limit, the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To determine compliance with the control device percent reduction requirement, the owner or operator shall use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure the HAP in Table 1 of this subpart or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure TOC.
