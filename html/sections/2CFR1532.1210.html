For example, the debarring official may consult with the EPA Regional offices, the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies, or state, tribal or local governments. The EPA debarring official will make sure that you have an opportunity to address important allegations or information contained in the administrative record before making a final decision on your request for reinstatement.</p>
