                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of this section, the term ``Circuit Equipment'' encompasses the Radio Systems and Circuit Equipment contained in Accounts 2230 through 2232 respectively. It includes central office equipment, other than switching equipment and automatic message recording equipment, which is used to derive communications transmission channels or which is used for the amplification, modulation, regeneration, testing, balancing or control of signals transmitted over communications transmission channels. Examples of circuit equipment in general use include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carrier telephone and telegraph system terminals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Telephone and telegraph repeaters, termination sets, impedance compensators, pulse link repeaters, echo suppressors and other intermediate transmission amplification and balancing equipment except that included in switchboards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Radio transmitters, receivers, repeaters and other radio central office equipment except message switching equipment associated with radio systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Composite ringers, line signaling and switching pad circuits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Concentration equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Composite sets and repeating coils.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Program transmission amplifiers, monitoring devices and volume indicators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Testboards, test desks, repair desks and patch bays, including those provided for test and control, and for telegraph and transmission testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For apportionment among the operations, the cost of circuit equiment is assigned to the following subsidiary categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.1. (i) Wideband Exchange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exchange Trunk Circuit Equipment (Wideband and Non-Wideband)--Category 4.12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exchange Line Circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband--Category 4.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.2.

(4) In addition, for the purpose of identifying and separating property associated with special services, circuit equipment included in Categories 4.12 (other than wideband equipment) 4.13 and 4.23 is identified as either basic circuit equipment, i.e., equipment that performs functions necessary to provide and operate channels suitable for voice transmission (telephone grade channels), or special circuit equipment, i.e., equipment that is peculiar to special service circuits. Carrier telephone terminals and carrier telephone repeaters are examples of basic circuit equipment is general use, while audio program transmission amplifiers, bridges, monitoring devices and volume indicators, telegraph carrier terminals and telegraph repeaters are examples of special circuit equipment in general use. Cost of exchange circuit equipment included in Categories 4.12 and 4.13 and the interexchange circuit equipment in Categories 4.21, 4.22 and 4.23 are segregated between basic circuit equipment and special circuit equipment only at those locations where amounts of interexchange and exchange special circuit equipment are significant. Where such segregation is not made, the total costs in these categories are classified as basic circuit equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2014, study areas subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to
