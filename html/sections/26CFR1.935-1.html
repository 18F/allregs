                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application of section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. Section 935 and this section  set forth the special rules relating to the filing of income tax  returns, income tax liabilities, and estimated income tax of individuals  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this  section also provides special rules requiring consistent treatment of  business entities in the United States and in section 935 possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individuals covered. This section applies to any individual  who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a bona fide resident of a section 935 possession during the  entire taxable year, whether or not such individual is a citizen of the  United States or a resident alien (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(A));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is a citizen of a section 935 possession but not otherwise a  citizen of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has income from sources within a section 935 possession for  the taxable year, is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien  (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(A)) and is not a bona fide resident of  a section 935 possession during the entire taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Files a joint return for the taxable year with any individual  described in paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term section 935 possession means Guam or the Northern  Mariana Islands, unless such possession has entered into an implementing  agreement, as described in section 1271(b) of the Tax Reform Act of  1986, Public Law 99-514 (100 Stat. 2085), with the United States that is  in effect for the entire taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term relevant possession means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to an individual described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)  of this section, the section 935 possession of which such individual is  a bona fide resident;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to an individual described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)  of this section, the section 935 possession of which such individual is  a citizen; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> With respect to an individual described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)  of this section, the section 935 possession from which such individual  derives income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-1 will apply for determining whether  an individual is a bona fide resident of a section 935 possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-2 generally will apply for determining  whether income is from sources within a section 935 possession. Pursuant  to Sec. 1.937-2(a), however, the rules of Sec. 1.937-2(c)(1)(ii) and  (c)(2) do not apply for purposes of section 935(a)(3) (as in effect  before the effective date of its repeal) and paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The term citizen of the United States means any individual who  is a citizen within the meaning of Sec. 1.1-1(c), except that the term  does not include an individual who is a citizen of a section 935  possession but not otherwise a citizen of the United States. The term  citizen of a section 935 possession but not otherwise a citizen of the  United States means any individual who has become a citizen of the  United States by birth   or naturalization in the section 935 possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to the United States, the term resident means an  individual who is a citizen (as defined in Sec. 1.1-1(c)) or resident  alien (as defined in section 7701(b)) and who does not have a tax home  (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) in a foreign country during the entire  taxable year. The term does not include an individual who is a bona fide  resident of a section 935 possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The term U.S. taxpayer means an individual described in  paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax jurisdiction. An individual  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must file an income tax  return for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the United States if such individual is a resident of the  United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With the relevant possession if such individual is described in  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If neither paragraph (b)(1)(i) nor paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of  this section applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With the relevant possession if such individual is described in  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With the United States if such individual is a citizen of the  United States, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section  and they file a joint return of income tax, the spouses shall file their  joint return with, and pay the tax due on such return to, the  jurisdiction where the spouse who has the greater adjusted gross income  for the taxable year would be required under subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph to file his return if separate returns were filed. For this  purpose, adjusted gross income of each spouse is determined under  section 62 and the regulations thereunder but without regard to  community property laws; and, if one of the spouses dies, the taxable  year of the surviving spouse shall be treated as ending on the date of  such death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Place for filing returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S. returns. A return required  under this paragraph (b) to be filed with the United States must be  filed as directed in the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guam returns. A return required under this paragraph (b) to be  filed with Guam must be filed as directed in the applicable forms and  instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NMI returns. A return required under this paragraph (b) to be  filed with the Northern Mariana Islands must be filed as directed in the  applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tax accounting standards. A taxpayer who has filed his return  with one of the jurisdictions named in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph for a prior taxable year and is required to file his return  for a later taxable year with the other such jurisdiction may not, for  such later taxable year, change his accounting period, method of  accounting, or any election to which he is bound with respect to his  reporting of taxable income to the first jurisdiction unless he obtains  the consent of the second jurisdiction to make such change. However,  such change will not be effective for returns filed thereafter with the  first jurisdiction unless before such later date of filing he also  obtains the consent of the first jurisdiction to make such change. Any  request for consent to make a change pursuant to this subparagraph must  be made to the office where the return is required to be filed under  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and in sufficient time to permit a  copy of the consent to be attached to the return for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tax payments. The tax shown on the return must be paid to the  jurisdiction with which such return is required to be filed and must be  determined by taking into account any credit under section 31 for tax  withheld by the relevant possession or the United States on wages, any  credit under section 6402(b) for an overpayment of income tax to the  relevant possession or the United States, and any payments under section  6315 of estimated income tax paid to the relevant possession or the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Liability to other jurisdiction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing with the relevant  possession. In the case of an individual who is required under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section   to file a return with the relevant possession for a taxable year, if  such individual properly files such return and fully pays his or her  income tax liability to the relevant possession, such individual is  relieved of liability to file an income tax return with, and to pay an  income tax to, the United States for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing with the United States. In the case of an individual who  is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to file a return with  the United States for a taxable year, such individual is relieved of  liability to file an income tax return with, and to pay an income tax  to, the relevant possession for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Extension of territory--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> U.S. taxpayers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  With respect to a U.S. taxpayer, for purposes of taxes imposed by  Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the United States  generally will be treated, in a geographical and governmental sense, as  including the relevant possession. The purpose of this rule is to  facilitate the coordination of the tax systems of the United States and  the relevant possession. Accordingly, the rule will have no effect where  it is manifestly inapplicable or its application would be incompatible  with the intent of any provision of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of general rule. Contexts in which the general rule  of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section apply include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The characterization of taxes paid to the relevant possession.  Income tax paid to the relevant possession may be taken into account  under sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b) as payments to the United States.  Taxes paid to the relevant possession and otherwise satisfying the  requirements of section 164(a) will be allowed as a deduction under that  section, but income taxes paid to the relevant possession will be  disallowed as a deduction under section 275(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of the source of income for purposes of the  foreign tax credit (for example, sections 901 through 904). Thus, for  example, after a U.S. taxpayer determines which items of income  constitute income from sources within the relevant possession under the  rules of section 937(b), such income will be treated as income from  sources within the United States for purposes of section 904;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The eligibility of a corporation to make a subchapter S election  (sections 1361 through 1379). Thus, for example, for purposes of  determining whether a corporation created or organized in the relevant  possession may make an election under section 1362(a) to be a subchapter  S corporation, it will be treated as a domestic corporation and a U.S.  taxpayer shareholder will not be treated as a nonresident alien  individual with respect to such corporation. While such an election is  in effect, the corporation will be treated as a domestic corporation for  all purposes of the Code. For the consistency requirement with respect  to entity status elections, see paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The treatment of items carried over from other taxable years.  Thus, for example, if a U.S. taxpayer has for a taxable year a net  operating loss carryback or carryover under section 172, a foreign tax  credit carryback or carryover under section 904, a business credit  carryback or carryover under section 39, a capital loss carryover under  section 1212, or a charitable contributions carryover under section 170,  the carryback or carryover will be reported on the return filed with the  United States in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(iii)(B)  of this section, even though the return of the taxpayer for the taxable  year giving rise to the carryback or carryover was required to be filed  with a section 935 possession; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The treatment of property exchanged for property of a like kind  (section 1031). Thus for example, if a U.S. taxpayer exchanges real  property located in the United States for real property located in the  relevant possession, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1031(h),  such exchange may qualify as a like-kind exchange under section 1031  (provided that all the other requirements of section 1031 are  satisfied).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nonapplication of general rule. Contexts in which the general  rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section does not apply include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The application of any rules or regulations that explicitly  treat the United States and any (or all) of its possessions as separate  jurisdictions (for example, sections 931 through 937, 7651, and 7654);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of any aspect of an individual's residency  (for example, sections 937(a) and 7701(b)). Thus, for example, an  individual whose principal place of abode is in the relevant possession  is not considered to have a principal place of abode in the United  States for purposes of section 32(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The determination of the source of income for purposes other  than the foreign tax credit (for example, sections 935, 937, and 7654).  Thus, for example, income determined to be derived from sources within  the relevant possession under section 937(b) will not be considered  income from sources within the United States for purposes of Form 5074,  ``Allocation of Individual Income Tax to Guam or the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The definition of wages (section 3401). Thus, for example,  services performed by an employee for an employer in the relevant  possession do not constitute services performed in the United States  under section 3401(a)(8); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The characterization of a corporation for purposes other than  subchapter S (for example, sections 367, 951 through 964, 1291 through  1298, 6038, and 6038B). Thus, for example, if a U.S. taxpayer transfers  appreciated tangible property to a corporation created or organized in  the relevant possession in a transaction described in section 351, he or  she must recognize gain unless an exception under section 367(a)  applies. Also, if a corporation created or organized in the relevant  possession qualifies as a passive foreign investment company under  sections 1297 and 1298 with respect to a U.S. taxpayer, a dividend paid  to such shareholder does not constitute qualified dividend income under  section 1(h)(11)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application in relevant possession. In applying the territorial  income tax of the relevant possession, such possession generally will be  treated, in a geographical and governmental sense, as including the  United States. Thus, for example, income tax paid to the United States  may be taken into account under sections 31, 6315, and 6402(b) as  payments to the relevant possession. Moreover, a citizen of the United  States (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) not a resident  of the relevant possession will not be treated as a nonresident alien  individual for purposes of the territorial income tax of the relevant  possession. Thus, for example, a citizen of the United States (as so  defined), or a resident of the United States, will not be treated as a  nonresident alien individual for purposes of section 1361(b)(1)(C) of  the Guam territorial income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for estimated income tax--(1) In general. An  individual must make each payment of estimated income tax (and any  amendment to the estimated tax payment) to the jurisdiction with which  the individual reasonably believes, as of the date of that payment (or  amendment), that he or she will be required to file a return for the  taxable year under paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. In determining the  amount of such estimated income tax, income tax paid to the relevant  possession may be taken into account under sections 31 and 6402(b) as  payments to the United States, and vice versa. For other rules relating  to estimated income tax, see section 6654.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Joint estimated income tax. In the case of married persons  making a joint payment of estimated income tax, the taxpayers must make  each payment of estimated income tax (and any amendment to the estimated  tax payment) to the jurisdiction where the spouse who has the greater  estimated adjusted gross income for the taxable year would be required  under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to pay estimated income tax if  separate payments were made. For this purpose, estimated adjusted gross  income of each spouse for the taxable year is determined without regard  to community property laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Erroneous payment. If the individual or spouses erroneously pay  estimated income tax to the United States instead of the relevant  possession or vice versa, only subsequent payments or amendments of the  payments are required to be made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2)  of this section with the other jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Place for payment. Estimated income tax required under this  paragraph (d) to be paid to Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands must be  paid as directed in the applicable forms and instructions issued by the  relevant possession. Estimated income tax required under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section to be paid to the United States must be paid as  directed in the applicable forms and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Liability to other jurisdiction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing with Guam or the  Northern Mariana Islands. Subject to paragraph (d)(6) of this section,  an individual required under this paragraph (d) to pay estimated income  tax (and amendments thereof) to Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands is  relieved of liability to pay estimated income tax (and amendments  thereof) to the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing with the United States. Subject to paragraph (d)(6) of  this section, an individual required under this paragraph (d) to pay  estimated income tax (and amendments thereof) to the United States is  relieved of liability to pay estimated income tax (and amendments  thereof) to the relevant possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Underpayments. The liability of an individual described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section for underpayments of estimated income  tax for a taxable year, as determined under section 6654, will be to the  jurisdiction with which the individual is required under paragraph (b)  of this section to file his or her return for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Entity status consistency requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Taxpayers  should make consistent entity status elections (as defined in paragraph  (e)(3)(ii) of this section), when applicable, in both the United States  and section 935 possessions. In the case of a business entity to which  this paragraph (e) applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an entity status election is filed with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) but not with the relevant possession, the appropriate tax  authority of the relevant possession, at his discretion, may deem the  election also to have been made for the relevant possession tax  purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an entity status election filed with the relevant possession  but not with the IRS, the Commissioner, at his discretion, may deem the  election also to have been made for Federal tax purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If inconsistent entity status elections are filed with the  relevant possession and the IRS, both the Commissioner and the  appropriate tax authority of the relevant possession may, at their  individual discretion, treat the elections they each received as invalid  and may deem the election filed in the other jurisdiction to have been  made also for tax purposes in their own jurisdiction. See Rev. Proc.  2006-23 (2006-1 C.B. 900) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this  chapter) for procedures for requesting the assistance of the IRS when a  taxpayer is or may be subject to inconsistent tax treatment by the IRS  and a U.S. possession tax agency.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scope. This paragraph (e) applies to the following business  entities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A business entity (as defined in Sec. 301.7701-2(a) of this  chapter) that is domestic (as defined in Sec. 301.7701-5 of this  chapter), or otherwise treated as domestic for purposes of the Code, and  that is owned in whole or in part by any person who is either a bona  fide resident of a section 935 possession or a business entity created  or organized in a section 935 possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A business entity that is created or organized in a section 935  possession and that is owned in whole or in part by any U.S. person  (other than a bona fide resident of such possession).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term appropriate tax authority of the relevant possession  means the individual responsible for tax administration in such  possession or his delegate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term entity status election includes an election under  Sec. 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter, an election under section 1362(a),  and any other similar elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Default status. Solely for the purpose of determining  classification of an eligible entity under Sec. 301.7701-3(b) of this  chapter and under that section as mirrored in the relevant possession,  an eligible entity subject to this paragraph (e) will be classified for  both Federal and the relevant possession tax purposes using the rule  that applies to domestic eligible entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an election filed prior to  April 11, 2005, except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this  section, the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section will apply as of  the first day of the first taxable year of the entity beginning after  April 11, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the unlikely circumstance that inconsistent elections  described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section are filed prior to  April 11, 2005, and the entity cannot change its classification to  achieve consistency because of the sixty-month limitation described in  Sec. 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv) of this chapter, then the entity may  nevertheless request permission from the Commissioner or appropriate tax  authority of the relevant possession to change such election to avoid  inconsistent treatment by the Commissioner and the appropriate tax  authority of the relevant possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (e)(5)(ii) of  this section, in the case of an election filed with respect to an entity  before it became an entity described in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section, the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section will apply as of  the first day that such entity is described in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of an entity created or organized prior to April  11, 2005, paragraph (e)(4) of this section will take effect for Federal  income tax purposes (or the relevant possession income tax purposes, as  the case may be) as of the first day of the first taxable year of the  entity beginning after April 11, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The application of this section is illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B, a United States citizen, files returns on a  calendar year basis. In November 2008, B moves to Possession G, a  section 935 possession; purchases a house; and accepts a permanent  position with a local employer. For the remainder of the year and  throughout 2009, B continues to live and work in Possession G and has a  closer connection to Possession G than to the United States or any  foreign country. As a consequence of his employment in Possession G, B  earns income from the performance of services in Possession G during  2008 and 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 2008, B does not qualify as a bona fide resident of  Possession G under section 937(a) and Sec. 1.937-1(b) and (f)(1).  Therefore, B is subject to the rules applicable to individuals described  in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section for 2008 because he has income  derived from sources within Possession G as determined under the rules  of section 937(b) and Sec. 1.937-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 2009, assuming that B otherwise satisfies the requirements  of section 937(a) and Sec. 1.937-1(b), B qualifies as a bona fide  resident of Possession G. Therefore, section 935(b)(1)(B) and paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section apply to B for 2009, and he must file his  income tax return with Possession G under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. Provided that B properly files such return and pays his income  tax liability to Possession G, B is relieved of liability to file an  income tax return with, and to pay an income tax to, the United States  for 2009 under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that  B's employment terminates in June 2011. B properly pays his April 2008  estimated tax to the United States, continues to pay estimated tax for  the 2008 taxable year to the United States under paragraph (d) of this  section, and properly files his 2008 return with the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On the date of each payment of estimated tax in 2009, B  reasonably believes that he would be required to file his return for  2009 with Possession G under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In August 2009, B determines that he has overpaid tax for the  previous year in the amount of $1000. B properly pays all estimated  taxes to Possession G for 2009, subtracting the $1000 overpayment from  his estimated tax payments pursuant to section 6402(b), and properly  files his tax return with Possession G.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In April 2010, B reasonably believes that he would be  returning to the United States in the Fall of 2010, and properly pays  estimated tax to the United States. By June 2010, B reasonably believes  that he would not be moving from Possession G and would be a bona fide  resident of Possession G for the entire taxable year. B makes his  remaining estimated tax payments to Possession G. On his 2010 tax return  filed with Possession G, pursuant to section 6315, B properly takes into  account payments made to both the United States and Possession G as  estimated taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In April 2011, B reasonably believes that he would be a bona  fide resident of Possession G for the entire taxable year 2011 and  properly pays estimated taxes to Possession G. By the time B pays his  estimated taxes for June 2011, B's employment terminates and he moves to  State H. B properly makes his remaining estimated tax payments to the   United States. On his return for 2011, properly filed with the United  States, B determines that he has underpaid estimated taxes throughout  2011 in an amount subject to penalty under section 6654. B owes the  United States an estimated tax penalty under section 6654.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(3),  (b)(5) through (b)(7), and (c) through (f) of this section apply to  taxable years ending after April 9, 2008.
