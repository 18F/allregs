                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section contains the technical criteria for evaluating applications requesting DTV facilities that do not conform to the provisions of Sec.  73.622 and petitions for rule making to amend the pre-transition DTV Table of Allotments (Sec.  73.622(b)). Petitions to amend the DTV Table (other than those also expressly requesting amendment of this section) and applications for new DTV broadcast stations or for changes in authorized DTV stations filed pursuant to this section will not be accepted for filing if they fail to comply with the requirements of this section. Petitions for rule making and applications seeking facilities that will operate after the end of the DTV transition must also comply with Sec.  73.616.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In considering petitions to amend the DTV Table and applications filed pursuant to this section, the Commission will use geographic coordinates defined in Sec.  73.622(d) as reference points in determining allotment separations and evaluating interference potential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum technical criteria for modification of DTV allotments included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments and for applications filed pursuant to this section. No petition to modify a channel allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments or application for authority to construct or modify a DTV station assigned to such an allotment, filed pursuant to this section, will be accepted unless it shows compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate that the requested change would not result in more than an additional 2 percent the population served by another station being subject to interference; provided, however, that no new interference may be caused to any station that already experiences interference to 10 percent or more of its population or that would result in a station receiving interference in excess of 10 percent of its population. The station population values for existing NTSC service and DTV service contained in Appendix B of the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of the Sixth Report and Order in MM Docket No. 87-268, FCC 98-24, adopted January 29, 1998, referenced in Sec.  73.622(c), are to be used for the purposes of determining whether a power increase or other change is permissible under this de minimis standard. For evaluating compliance with this requirement, interference to populations served is to be predicted based on the procedure set forth in OET Bulletin No. 69, including population served within service areas determined in accordance with section 73.622(e), consideration of whether F(50,10) undesired signals will exceed the following desired-to-undesired (D/U) signal ratios, assumed use of a directional receiving antenna, and use of the terrain dependent Longley-Rice point-to-point propagation model. Copies of OET Bulletin No. 69 may be inspected during normal business hours at the: Federal Communications Commission, Room CY-C203, 445 12th Street, SW., Reference Information Center, Washington, DC 20554. These documents are also available through the Internet on the FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov. The threshold levels at which interference is considered to occur are:
