All licensees shall cooperate in  the selection and use of channels in order to reduce interference. This  includes monitoring for   communications in progress and any other measures as may be necessary to  minimize interference. Licensees suffering or causing harmful  interference within a communications zone are expected to cooperate and  resolve this problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the  licensees are unable to do so, the Commission may impose restrictions,  including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height and  direction, additional filtering, or area or hours of operation of the  stations concerned. Further, the use of any channel at a given  geographical location may be denied when, in the judgment of the  Commission, its use at that location is not in the public interest; the  use of any channel may be restricted as to specified geographical areas,  maximum power, or such other operating conditions, contained in this  part or in the station authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safety/public safety priority.

On-Board Units (OBUs) operated by state or local governmental  entities are presumptively engaged in public safety priority  communications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-priority communications. DSRCS communications not listed in  paragraph (c) of this section, are non-priority communications. If a  dispute arises concerning non-priority DSRCS-OBU communications with  Roadside Units (RSUs), the provisions of Sec. 90.377(e) and (f) of this  chapter will apply. Disputes concerning non-priority DSRCS-OBU  communications not associated with RSUs are governed by paragraph (b) of  this section.  [71 FR 52750, Sept. 7, 2006]</p>
