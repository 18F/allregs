The claim, together with the reports of the employee and the investigation, shall be reviewed in the legal division which shall thereupon make a recommendation that the claim be approved, disapproved, or compromised, and shall advise on the need for referral of the claim to the Department of Justice. This recommendation and advice, together with the file, shall be forwarded to the head of the bureau or office or his designee.
