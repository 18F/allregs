                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An applicant for a digital LPTV or TV translator station  construction permit shall specify that the station will be constructed  to confine out-of-channel emissions within one of the following emission  masks: Simple, stringent or full service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and (a)(3), A is the attenuation in dB and [Delta]f is the  frequency difference in MHz from the edge of the channel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Simple mask. At the channel edges, emissions must be attenuated  no less than 46 dB. More than 6 MHz from the channel edges, emissions  must be attenuated no less than 71 dB. At any frequency between 0 and 6  MHz from the channel edges, emissions must be attenuated no less than  the value determined by the following formula:  A (dB) = 46 + ([Delta]f\2\ /1.44)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stringent mask. In the first 500 kHz from the channel edges,  emissions must be attenuated no less than 47 dB. More than 3 MHz from  the channel edges, emissions must be attenuated no less than 76 dB. At  any frequency between 0.5 and 3 MHz from the channel edges, emissions  must be attenuated no less than the value determined by the following  formula:  A(dB) = 47 + 11.5 ([Delta]f-0.5)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Full service mask: (A) The power level of emissions on  frequencies outside the authorized channel of operation must be  attenuated no less than the following amounts below the average  transmitted power within the authorized channel. In the first 500 kHz  from the channel edge the emissions must be attenuated no less than 47  dB. More than 6 MHz from the channel edge, emissions must be attenuated  no less than 110 dB. At any frequency between 0.5 and 6 MHz from the  channel   edge, emissions must be attenuated no less than the value determined by  the following formula:  Attenuation in dB = -11.5([Delta]f + 3.6);  Where:  [Delta] f = frequency difference in MHz from the edge of the channel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> This attenuation is based on a measurement bandwidth of 500 kHz.  Other measurement bandwidths may be used as long as appropriate  correction factors are applied. Measurements need not be made any closer  to the band edge than one half of the resolution bandwidth of the  measuring instrument. Emissions include sidebands, spurious emissions  and radio frequency harmonics. Attenuation is to be measured at the  output terminals of the transmitter (including any filters that may be  employed). In the event of interference caused to any service, greater  attenuation may be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The attenuation values for the simple and stringent emission  masks are based on a measurement bandwidth of 500 kHz. Other measurement  bandwidths may be used and converted to the reference 500 kHz value by  the following formula:  A(dB) = Aalternate + 10 log (BWalternate / 500)   where A(dB) is the measured or calculated attenuation value for the  reference 500 kHz bandwidth, and Aalternate is the measured  or calculated attenuation for a bandwidth BWalternate.  Emissions include sidebands, spurious emissions and radio harmonics.  Attenuation is to be measured at the output terminals of the transmitter  (including any filters that may be employed). In the event of  interference caused to any service by out-of-channel emissions, greater  attenuation may be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to meeting the emission attenuation requirements of  the simple or stringent mask (including attenuation of radio frequency  harmonics), digital low power TV and TV translator stations authorized  to operate on TV channels 22-24, (518-536 MHz), 32-36 (578-608 MHz), 38  (614-620 MHz), and 65-69 (776-806 MHz) must provide specific ``out of  band'' protection to Radio Navigation Satellite Services in the bands:  L5 (1164-1215 MHz); L2 (1215-1240 MHz) and L1 (1559-1610 MHz).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An FCC-certificated transmitter specifically certified for use  on one or more of the above channels must include filtering with an  attenuation of not less than 85 dB in the GPS bands, which will have the  effect of reducing harmonics in the GPS bands from what is produced by  the digital transmitter, and this attenuation must be demonstrated as  part of the certification application to the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For an installation on one of the above channels with a digital  transmitter not specifically FCC-certificated for the channel, a low  pass filter or equivalent device rated by its manufacturer to have an  attenuation of at least 85 dB in the GPS bands, which will have the  effect of reducing harmonics in the GPS bands from what is produced by  the digital transmitter, and must be installed in a manner that will  prevent the harmonic emission content from reaching the antenna. A  description of the low pass filter or equivalent device with the  manufacturer's rating or a report of measurements by a qualified  individual shall be retained with the station license. Field  measurements of the second or third harmonic output of a transmitter so  equipped are not required.  [69 FR 69336, Nov. 29, 2004, as amended at 76 FR 44828, July 27, 2011]</p>
