The failure to meet any of the milestones contained in an authorization will result in its cancellation, unless such failure is due to circumstances beyond the licensee's control or unless otherwise determined by the Commission upon proper showing by the licensee in any particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frequency assignments will be made for each satellite DARS system as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exclusive SDARS licenses are limited to the 2320-2345 MHz segment of the 2310-2360 MHz allocated bandwidth for SDARS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two, 12.5 MHz frequency assignments are available for satellite DARS: 2320.0-2332.5 MHz and 2332.5-2345.0 MHz;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Satellite DARS licensees may reduce their assigned bandwidth occupancy to provide telemetry beacons in their exclusive frequency assignments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each licensee may employ cross polarization within its exclusive frequency assignment and/or may employ cross polarized transmissions in frequency assignments of other satellite DARS licensees under mutual agreement with those licensees. Licensees who come to mutual agreement to use cross-polarized transmissions shall apply to the Commission for approval of the agreement before coordination is initiated with other administrations by the licensee of the exclusive frequency assignment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Feeder uplink networks are permitted in the following Fixed-Satellite Service frequency bands: 7025-7075 MHz and 6725-7025 MHz (101[deg] W.L. orbital location only).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Power limit for SDARS terrestrial repeaters.
