In each case the decision of the Board shall be in writing,  shall include findings of fact, and shall include the reasons for the  Board's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Grievance Board finds that the grievance is meritorious,  the Board shall have the authority within the limitations of the  authority of the head of the agency, to direct the agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To correct any official personnel record relating to the  grievant which the Board finds to be inaccurate, erroneous, or falsely  prejudicial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To reverse and administrative decision denying the grievant  compensation including related within-class salary increases pursuant to  section 625 of the Act or any other perquisite of employment authorized  by law or regulation when the Board finds that such denial was  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law or regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To retain in service and employee whose termination would be in  consequence of the matter by which the employee is aggrieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To reinstate with back pay, under applicable law and  regulations, an employee where it is clearly established that the  separation or suspension without pay of the employee was unjustified or  unwarranted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To order an extension of the time of an employee's eligibility  for promotion to a higher class where the employee suffered career  impairment in consequence of the matter by which the employee is  aggrieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To order that an employee be provided with facilities relating  to the physical working environment which the employee has been denied  arbitrarily, capriciously or in violation of applicable regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(7)</em> shall be presented as Board recommendations, the decision on  which shall be subject to the sole discretion of the agency head or  designee, who shall take into account the needs of the Service in  deciding on such recommendations, and shall not be subjected to judicial  review under section 694 of the Act. The reason(s) for the agency head's  (or designee's) decision will be conveyed in writing to the Board and  the grievant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Board finds that the grievance is meritorious and that  remedial action should be taken that directly relates to promotion or  assignment of the grievant, or to other remedial action, including  additional step increases, not provided for in paragraph (b) of this  section, or if the Board finds that the evidence before it warrants  disciplinary action against any officer or employee, it shall make an  appropriate recommendation to the head of the agency, and forward to the  head of the agency the record of the Board's proceedings, including the  transcript of the hearing, if any. The head of the agency (or designee,  who shall not have direct responsibility for administrative management)  shall make a written decision to the parties and to the Board on the  Board's recommendation within 30 days from receipt of the  recommendation. A recommendation of the Board may be rejected in part or  in whole if the action recommended   would be contrary to law, would adversely affect the foreign policy or  security of the United States, or would substantially impair the  efficiency of the Service. If the decision rejects the Board's  recommendation in part or in whole, the decision shall state  specifically any and all reasons for such action. Pending the decision,  there shall be no ex parte communications concerning the grievance  between the agency head, or designee, and any person involved in the  grievance proceeding.</p>
