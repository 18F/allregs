                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Satisfactory progress. An Applicant that has received one or  more grants and/or guaranteed loans under this program must make  satisfactory progress, as determined by the Agency, toward completion of  any previously funded projects before the Applicant will be considered  for subsequent funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application submittal. Applications must be submitted in  accordance with the provisions of this subpart unless otherwise  specified in a Federal Register notice.

Complete grant applications will be accepted  on a continuous basis, with awards made based on the application's score  and subject to available funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guaranteed loan-only applications. Complete guaranteed loan-only  applications will be accepted on a continuous basis, with awards made  based on the application's score and subject to available funding. Each  application that is ready for funding and that scores at or above the  minimum score will be competed on a periodic basis, with higher scoring  applications receiving priority. Each application ready for funding that  receives a score below the minimum score will be competed in a National  Office competition at the end of the fiscal year in which the  application was ready to be competed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combined guaranteed loan and grant applications. Applications  requesting a RES or EEI grant and a guaranteed loan under this subpart  will be accepted on a continuous basis, with awards made based on the  grant application's score and subject to available funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limit on number of applications.

An Applicant can submit only  one type of funding request (grant-only, guaranteed loan-only, or  combined funding) for each project under this subpart per Federal Fiscal  Year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application modification. Once submitted and prior to Agency  award, if an Applicant modifies its application, the application will be  treated as a new application. The submission date of record for such  modified applications will be the date the Agency receives the modified  application, and the application will be processed by the Agency as a  new application under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Incomplete applications. Applicants must submit Complete  Applications in order to be considered for funding. If an application is  incomplete, the Agency will identify those parts of the application that  are incomplete and return it, with a written explanation, to the  Applicant for possible future resubmission. Upon receipt of a Complete  Application by the appropriate Agency office, the Agency will complete  its evaluation and will compete the application in accordance with the  procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 4280.121, 4280.179, or 4280.193 as  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Application withdrawal. During the period between the submission  of an application and the execution of loan and/or grant award documents  for an application selected for funding, the Applicant must notify the  Agency, in writing, if the project is no longer viable or the Applicant  no longer is requesting financial assistance for the project. When the  Applicant notifies the Agency, the selection will be rescinded and/or  the application withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> through (3), as applicable, of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Technical report format and detail. The information in the  technical report must follow the format specified in Sec.  4280.119(b)(3), Sec. 4280.119(b)(4), and Appendices A through C   of this subpart, as applicable.

Such demonstration shall address project design, installation,  operation, and maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical report modifications. If a technical report is  prepared prior to the Applicant's selection of a final design, equipment  vendor, or contractor, or other significant decision, it may be modified  and resubmitted to the Agency, provided that the overall scope of the  project is not materially changed as determined by the Agency. Changes  in the technical report may require an updated Form RD 1940-20,  ``Request for Environmental Information.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hybrid projects. If the application is for a Hybrid project,  technical reports must be prepared for each technology that comprises  the Hybrid project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section, grant funds not expended within 2  years from the date the Grant Agreement was signed by the Agency will be  returned to the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time extensions.

Grantees must submit a request for the no-cost extension no later than  30 days before the expiration date of the Grant Agreement. This request  must describe the extenuating circumstances that were beyond their  control to complete the project for which the grant was awarded, and why  an approval is in the government's best interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Return of funds to the agency.
