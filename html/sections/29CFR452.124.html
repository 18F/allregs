                                Sec. 452.124  Delegates from units which are not labor organizations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To the extent that units, such as committees, which do not meet the  definition of a labor organization under the Act \55\ participate in the  election of officers of a national or international labor organization  or an intermediate body, through delegates to the convention or  otherwise, the provisions of title IV are, nevertheless, applicable to  the election of such delegates. The following example is typical in  organizations of railway employees. The chairman of a local grievance  committee, which is not a labor organization under the Act, is not an  officer within the meaning of the Act. If such a local chairman is a  delegate to the general grievance committee, which is considered to be  an intermediate body under the Act, however, he must be elected by  secret ballot vote of the members he represents, if he votes for  officers of the general grievance committee. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\55\ Act, sec. 3 (i) and (j) and part 451 of this chapter. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
