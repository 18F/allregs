                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Lightning protection. A licensee shall ensure that the public is  not exposed to hazards due to the initiation of explosives by lightning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Elements of a lighting protection system. Unless an explosive  hazard facility meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, all explosive hazard facilities shall have a lightning  protection system to ensure explosives are not initiated by lightning. A  lightning protection system shall meet the requirements of this  paragraph and include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Air terminal. An air terminal to intentionally attract a  lightning strike.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Down conductor. A low impedance path connecting an air terminal  to an earth electrode system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Earth electrode system. An earth electrode system to dissipate  the current from a lightning strike to ground.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bonding and surge protection. A lightning protection system must  meet the requirements of this paragraph and include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bonding. All metallic bodies shall be bonded to ensure that  voltage potentials due to lightning are equal everywhere in the  explosive hazard facility. Any fence within six feet of a lightning  protection system shall have a bond across each gate and other  discontinuations and shall be bonded to the lightning protection system.  Railroad tracks that run within six feet of the lightning protection  system shall be bonded to the lightning protection system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Surge protection. A lightning protection system shall include  surge protection to reduce transient voltages due to lightning to a  harmless level for all metallic power, communication, and  instrumentation lines entering an explosive hazard facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Circumstances where no lightning protection system is required.  No lightning protection system is required for an explosive hazard  facility when a lightning warning system is available to permit  termination of operations and withdrawal of the public to public area  distance prior to an electrical storm, or for an explosive hazard  facility containing explosives that cannot be initiated by lightning. If  no lightning protection system is required, a licensee must ensure the  withdrawal of the public to a public area distance prior to an  electrical storm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Testing and inspection. Lightning protection systems shall be  visually inspected semiannually and shall be tested once each year for  electrical continuity and adequacy of grounding. A licensee shall  maintain at the explosive hazard facility a record of results obtained  from the tests, including any action taken to correct deficiencies  noted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Electrical power lines. A licensee shall ensure that electric  power lines at its launch site meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Electric power lines shall be no closer to an explosive hazard  facility than the length of the lines between the poles or towers that  support the lines unless an effective means is provided to ensure that  energized lines cannot, on breaking, come in contact with the explosive  hazard facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Towers or poles supporting electrical distribution lines that  carry between 15 and 69 KV, and unmanned electrical substations shall be  no closer to an explosive hazard facility than the public area distance  for that explosive hazard facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Towers or poles supporting electrical transmission lines that  carry 69 KV or more, shall be no closer to an explosive hazard facility  than the public area distance for that explosive hazard facility.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
