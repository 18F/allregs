                            <p class="depth0">This part applies to every carrier, as defined in Sec. 250.1, with respect to scheduled flight segments using an aircraft that has a designed passenger capacity of 30 or more passenger seats, operating in (1) interstate air transportation or (2) foreign air transportation with respect to nonstop flight segments originating at a point within the United States.

Sec. 250.2a  Policy regarding denied boarding.</p><p class="depth0">In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall ensure that the smallest practicable number of persons holding confirmed reserved space on that flight are denied boarding involuntarily.


Sec. 250.2b  Carriers to request volunteers for denied boarding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall request volunteers for denied boarding before using any other boarding priority. A ``volunteer'' is a person who responds to the carrier's request for volunteers and who willingly accepts the carriers' offer of

compensation, in any amount, in exchange for relinquishing the confirmed reserved space. Any other passenger denied boarding is considered for purposes of this part to have been denied boarding involuntarily, even if that passenger accepts the denied boarding compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every carrier shall advise each passenger solicited to volunteer for denied boarding, no later than the time the carrier solicits that passenger to volunteer, whether he or she is in danger of being involuntarily denied boarding and, if so, the compensation the carrier is obligated to pay if the passenger is involuntarily denied boarding. If an insufficient number of volunteers come forward, the carrier may deny boarding to other passengers in accordance with its boarding priority rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a carrier offers free or reduced rate air transportation as compensation to volunteers, the carrier must disclose all material restrictions, including but not limited to administrative fees, advance purchase or capacity restrictions, and blackout dates applicable to the offer before the passenger decides whether to give up his or her confirmed reserved space on that flight in exchange for the free or reduced rate transportation.
