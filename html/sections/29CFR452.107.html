                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the provisions of section 401(c), each candidate must be  permitted to have an observer (1) at the polls and (2) at the counting  of the ballots. This right encompasses every phase and level of the  counting and tallying process, including the counting and tallying of  the ballots and the totaling, recording, and reporting of tally sheets.  If there is more than one polling place, the candidate may have an  observer at each location. If ballots are being counted at more than one  location or at more than one table at a single location, a candidate is  entitled to as many observers as necessary to observe the actual  counting of ballots. The observer may note the names of those voting so  that the candidates may be able to ascertain whether unauthorized  persons voted in the election. The observers should be placed so that  they do not compromise, or give the appearance of compromising, the  secrecy of the ballot. The observer is not required to be a member of  the labor organization unless the union's constitution and bylaws  require him to be a member. There is no prohibition on the use of  alternate observers, when necessary, or on a candidate serving as his  own observer. Observers do not have the right to count the ballots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The right to have an observer at the polls and at the counting  of the ballots extends to all candidates for office in an election  subject to title IV, i.e., this includes elections in intermediate  bodies as well as elections in locals and national and international  labor organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any secret ballot election which is conducted by mail,  regardless of whether the ballots are returned by members to the labor  organization office, to a mail box, or to an independent agency such as  a firm of certified public accountants, candidates must be permitted to  have an observer present at the preparation and mailing of the ballots,  their receipt by the counting agency and at the opening and counting of  the ballots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Paying election observers is the responsibility of the candidate  they represent unless the union has a rule providing for the payment of  observers. If the union does have such a rule, it must be uniformly  applied to all candidates.</p>
