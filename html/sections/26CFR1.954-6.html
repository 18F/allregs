                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section prescribes rules for  determining foreign base company shipping income under the provisions of  section 954(f), as amended by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rules prescribed in this section apply  to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31,  1975, and to taxable years of United States shareholders (as defined in  section 951 (b)) within which or with which such taxable years of such  foreign corporations end.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section for an illustration of the effect of this subparagraph on  certain dividend income. See paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this section for  the effect of this subparagraph on certain interest and gains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Foreign base company shipping income. The term  ``foreign base company shipping income'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income derived from, or in connection with, the use (or  hiring or leasing for use) of any aircraft or vessel in foreign commerce  (see paragraph (c) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross income derived from, or in connection with, the  performance of services directly related to the use of any aircraft or  vessel in foreign commerce (see paragraph (d) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gross income incidental to income described in subdivisions  (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, as provided in paragraph (e) of this  section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gross income derived from the sale, exchange, or other  disposition of any aircraft or vessel used or held for use (by the  seller or by a person related to the seller) in foreign commerce,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, dividends,  interest, and gains described in paragraph (f) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Income described in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to  partnerships, trusts, etc.),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Exchange gain, to the extent allocable to foreign base company  shipping income (see Sec. 1.952-2(c)(2)(v)(b), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> In the case of a controlled foreign corporation and at its  option, dividends, interest, and gains attributable to income derived  from aircraft and vessels (as defined in 26 CFR 1.954-1(b)(2) (Revised  as of April 1, 1975)) by a less developed country shipping company  (described in Sec. 1.955-5(b)) in taxable years beginning after December  31, 1962, and before January 1, 1976. The portion of a dividend,  interest, or gain attributable to such income shall be determined by the  same method as that for determining the portion of a dividend, interest,  or gain attributable to foreign base company shipping income under  paragraphs (f)(4), (5), and (6) of this section, but without regard to  paragraphs (f)(6)(ii) and (iv)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign base company shipping operations. For purposes of  sections 951 through 964, the term ``foreign base company shipping  operations'' means the trade or business from which gross income  described in subparagraph (1)(i) and (ii) of this paragraph is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign commerce. For purposes of sections 951 through 964--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An aircraft or vessel is used in foreign commerce to the extent  it is used in transportation of property or passengers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Between a port (or airport) in the United States or possession  of the United States and a port (or airport) in a foreign country, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this paragraph (b)(3),  foreign base company income does not include income derived from, or in  connection with, the use of an aircraft or vessel in transportation of  property or passengers between a port (or airport) in a foreign country  and another port (or airport) in the same country if both the foreign  corporation is created or organized and the aircraft or vessel is  registered in that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term vessel includes all water craft and other artificial  contrivances of whatever description and at whatever stage of  construction, whether on the stocks or launched, which are used or are  capable of being used or are intended to be used as a means of  transportation on water. This definition does not apply for purposes of  section 956(b)(2)(G) and Sec. 1.956-2(b)(1)(ix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term port means any place (whether on or off shore) where  aircraft or vessels are accustomed to load or unload goods or to take on  or let off passengers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any vessel (such as a lighter or beacon lightship) which serves  other vessels used in foreign commerce (within the meaning of  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) shall, to the extent so used, also  be considered to be used in foreign commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For the meaning of the term ``foreign country'', see section  638(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use in foreign commerce. For purposes of sections 951 through  964, the use of an aircraft or vessel in foreign commerce includes the  hiring or leasing (or subleasing) of an aircraft or vessel to another  for use in foreign commerce. Thus, for example, an aircraft or vessel is  ``used in foreign commerce'' within the meaning of section 955(b)(1)(A)  if such aircraft or vessel is chartered (whether pursuant to a bareboat  charter, time charter, or otherwise) to another for use in foreign  commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Related person. With respect to a controlled foreign  corporation, the term ``related person'' means a related person as  defined in Sec. 1.954-1(e)(1), and the term ``unrelated person'' means  an unrelated person as defined in Sec. 1.954-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Aircraft or vessel income--(1) In general. The term ``income  derived from, or in connection with, the use (or hiring or leasing for  use) of any aircraft or vessel in foreign commerce'' as used in  paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income derived from transporting passengers or property by  aircraft or vessel in foreign commerce and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income derived from hiring or leasing an aircraft or vessel to  another for use in foreign commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation C owns a foreign flag vessel which it  charters under a long-term charter to foreign corporation D. The vessel  is used by D as a tramp which has no fixed or regular schedule. The  vessel carries bulk and packaged cargoes, as well as occasional  passengers, under charter parties, contracts of affreightment, or other  contracts of carriage. The carriage of cargoes and passengers is between  a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country or between a  port in one foreign country and another port in the same or a different  foreign country. The charter hire paid to C by D constitutes income  derived from the use of the vessel in foreign commerce, but is not  foreign base company income to the extent the charter hire is allocable  to income derived from the use of the vessel between ports in the same  foreign country in which both C is incorporated and the vessel is  registered. The charter hire and freight and passenger revenue  (including demurrage and dead freight) derived by D also constitute  income derived from the use of the vessel in foreign commerce, but is  not foreign base company income to the extent the charter hire and  freight and passenger revenue are allocable to the use of the vessel  between ports in the same foreign country in which both D is  incorporated and the vessel is registered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Foreign corporation E owns a foreign flag tanker  which it charters under a long-term bareboat charter to foreign  corporation F for use in foreign commerce. F produces oil in a foreign  country and ships the oil to other foreign countries and to the United  States. The vessel, when not engaged in carrying F's oil, is used to  carry bulk cargoes for unrelated persons in foreign commerce as  opportunity offers. The charger hire received by E constitutes income  derived from the use of the vessel in foreign commerce. The income  derived by F from carrying bulk cargoes for unrelated persons also  constitutes income derived from the use of the vessel in foreign  commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> F is forced to lay up the vessel as a result of adverse market  developments. Pursuant to the terms of the charter, F continues to pay  charter hire to E during the period of lay-up. The charter hire received  by E during the period of lay-up constitutes income derived from the use  of the vessel in foreign commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A shipment of cheese is loaded into a container owned  by controlled foreign corporation S at the consignor's place of business  in Hamar, Norway. The cheese is transported to Milan, Italy, by the  following routings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overland by road from Hamar, Norway, to Gothenburg, Sweden, by  unrelated motor carriers via Oslo, Norway,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> By sea from Gothenburg to Rotterdam, Netherlands, by feeder  vessel under foreign flag, time chartered to S by unrelated owner,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> By sea from Rotterdam to Algeciras, Spain, by feeder vessel  under foreign flag, time chartered to S by unrelated owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> By sea from Algeciras to Genoa, Italy, by line-haul vessel under  U.S. flag, chartered by S from related company, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Overland from Genoa to Milan, Italy, by unrelated motor carrier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The consignor pays S total charges of $1,710, and S pays $676 to  unrelated third parties, which amounts may be broken down as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Revenue     Costs</p><p class="depth0">Amount   collected   paid to</p><p class="depth0">billed to   by S on   unrelated</p><p class="depth0">Description of charges           customer  behalf of   3d party</p><p class="depth0">and         an        and</p><p class="depth0">collected  unrelated   absorbed</p><p class="depth0">by S      party       by S ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ocean freight..........................     $1,420</p><p class="depth0">Trucking charge of empty equipment to           50        $50</p><p class="depth0">shipper's facility....................

The term ``income  derived from, or in connection with, the performance of services  directly related to the use of an aircraft or vessel in foreign  commerce'', as used in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section, means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income derived from, or in connection with, the performance of  services described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income treated as foreign base company shipping income under  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intragroup services. The services described in this subparagraph  are services performed for a person who is the owner, lessor, lessee or  operator of an aircraft or vessel used in foreign commerce, by such  person or by a person related to such person, and which fall into one or  more of the following categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terminal services, such as dockage, wharfage, storage, lights,  water, refrigeration, and similar services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stevedoring and other cargo handling services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Container related services (including the rental of containers  and related equipment) performed either in connection with the local  drayage or inland haulage of cargo or in the course of transportation in  foreign commerce;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Services performed by tugs, lighters, barges, scows, launches,  floating cranes, and other similar equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Maintenance and repairs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Training of pilots and crews;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Licensing of patents, know-how, and similar intangible  property developed and used in the course of foreign base company  shipping operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Services performed by a booking, operating, or managing  agent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any service performed in the course of the actual  transportation of passengers or property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Services for passenger, consignor, or consignee. The services  described in this subparagraph are services provided by the operator (or  person related to the operator) of an aircraft or vessel in foreign  commerce for the passenger, consignor, or consignee, such as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (iv) and (ix) of this paragraph,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rental of staterooms, berths, or living accommodations and  the furnishing of meals,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Barber shop and other services to passengers aboard vessels,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Excess baggage, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Demurrage, dispatch, and dead freight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The 70-percent test. At the option of the foreign corporation  all the gross income for a taxable year derived by a foreign corporation  from any facility used in connection with the performance of services  described in one or more of the categories set out in subparagraph  (2)(i) through (ix) of this paragraph is foreign base company shipping  income if more than 70 percent of such gross income for either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such taxable year and the two preceding taxable years,  is foreign base company shipping income (determined without regard to  this subparagraph). Thus, for example, if 80 percent of the gross income  derived by a controlled foreign corporation at a stevedoring facility is  treated   as foreign base company shipping income under subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, then the remaining 20 percent is treated as foreign base  company shipping income under this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules for applying subparagraph (4). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Solely for purposes of  applying subparagraphs (4) of this paragraph, foreign base company  shipping income and gross income shall be deemed to include an arm's  length charge (see paragraph (h)(5) of this section) for services  performed by the foreign corporation for itself.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining whether services performed by a foreign  corporation are performed at a single facility or at two or more  different facilities, all of the facts and circumstances involved will  be taken into account. Ordinarily, all services performed by a foreign  corporation within a single port area will be considered performed at a  single facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of this subparagraph and subparagraph (4) of  this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example in which it  is assumed that the foreign corporation has chosen to apply the 70- percent test of subparagraph (4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Controlled foreign corporation X uses the calendar year  as the taxable year. For 1976, X is divided into two operating  divisions, A and B. Division A operates a number of vessels in foreign  commerce. Division B operates a terminal facility at which it performs  services described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph for vessels  some of which are operated by division A, some of which are operated by  persons related to X, and some of which are operated by persons  unrelated to X. For 1976, X includes under subparagraph (5) as foreign  base company shipping income and gross income, for purposes of  subparagraph (4), an arm's length charge for services performed for  itself. For 1976, the gross income derived by division B is  reconstructed for purposes of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph as  follows, based on the facts shown in the following table:  (1) Gross income derived from persons unrelated to X...........      $20 (2) Gross income derived from persons related to X.............       10</p><p class="depth0">-------- (3) Actual gross income (line (1) plus line (2))...............       30 (4) Hypothetical gross income derived from division A                 70</p><p class="depth0">(determined by the application of subdivision (i) of this</p><p class="depth0">subparagraph).................................................</p><p class="depth0">-------- (5) Total reconstructed gross income (line (3) plus line (4))..      100</p><p class="depth0">========</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Since 80 percent of the reconstructed gross income derived by  division B would be treated as foreign base company shipping income  under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the entire $30 amount of the  gross income actually derived by division B is treated as foreign base  company shipping income under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Arm's length charge. For purposes of this section, the arm's  length charge for services performed by a foreign corporation for itself  shall be determined by applying the principles of section 482 and the  regulations thereunder as if the party for whom the services are  performed and the party by whom the services are performed were not the  same person, but were controlled taxpayers within the meaning of  Sec. 1.482-1(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A acts as a managing agent  for foreign corporation B, a related person which contracts to construct  and charter a foreign flag vessel for use in foreign commerce. As  managing agent for B, A performs a broad range of services relating to  the use of the vessel, including arranging for, and supervising of,  construction and chartering of the vessel, and handling of operating  services after construction is completed. The income derived by A from  its management and operating services constitutes income derived in  connection with the performance of services directly related to the use  of the vessel in foreign commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation C uses the calendar year  as the taxable year. During 1976, C is engaged in the trade or business  of acting as a steamship agent solely for unrelated persons. C's  activities as steamship agent range from ``husbanding'' (i.e., arranging  for fuel, supplies and port services, and attending to crew and customs  matters) to the solicitation and booking of cargo at a number of foreign  ports. None of C's other gross income for 1976 is foreign base company  shipping income. Under these circumstances, C's gross income derived  from its steamship agency does not constitute foreign base company  shipping income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Incidental income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Foreign base company shipping  income includes all incidental income derived by a foreign corporation  in the course of its active conduct of foreign base company shipping  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. Examples of incidental income derived in the course of  the active conduct of foreign base company shipping operations include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of assets  which are related shipping assets within the meaning of Sec. 1.955A- 2(b),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income derived from temporary investments described in  Sec. 1.955A-2(b)(2)(i) and (iii),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interest on accounts receivable and evidences of indebtedness  described in Sec. 1.955A-2(b)(2)(ii),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income derived from granting concessions to others aboard  aircraft or vessels used in foreign commerce,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Income derived from stock and currency futures described in  Sec. 1.955A-2(b)(2)(vii) and (viii),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Income derived by the lessor of an aircraft or vessel used in  foreign commerce from additional rentals for the use of related  equipment (such as a complement of containers), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Interest derived by the seller from a purchase money mortgage  loan in respect of the sale of an aircraft or vessel described in  Sec. 1.955A-2(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain dividends, interest, and gain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  foreign base company shipping income of a controlled foreign corporation  (referred to in subdivision (ii)(A) of this paragraph (f)(1) as ``first  corporation'') includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dividends and interest received from foreign corporations listed  in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (f)(1), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gain recognized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of  stock or obligations of foreign corporations listed in subdivision (ii)  of this paragraph (f)(1),  but only to the extent that such dividends, interest, and gains are  attributable to foreign base company shipping income of the foreign  corporations listed in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign corporations referred to in subdivision (i) of this  paragraph (f)(1) are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Foreign corporations with respect to which the first corporation  (see subdivision (i) of this paragraph (f)(1)) would be deemed under  section 902(b) to pay taxes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Controlled foreign corporations which are related persons  (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Less developed country shipping companies described in  Sec. 1.955-5(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporation deemed to pay taxes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this  paragraph, a controlled foreign corporation would be deemed under  section 902(b) to pay taxes in respect of any other foreign corporation  if such controlled foreign corporation would be deemed, for purposes of  applying section 902(a) to any United States shareholder of such  controlled foreign corporation, to pay taxes in respect of dividends  which were received from such other foreign corporation (whether or not  such other foreign corporation actually pays any taxes or dividends).  Solely for purposes of this subdivision, each United States shareholder  (within the meaning of section 951(b)) shall be deemed to be a domestic  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent of the one class  of stock of controlled foreign corporation X, which in turn owns 40  percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation Y. Y is not a  controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of subdivision (1) of this  subparagraph, X is deemed to pay taxes in respect of Y.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that  United States shareholder A, an individual, owns 80 percent of the stock  of corporation X, and United States shareholders B and C, parent and  child, own the other 20 percent in equal shares. For purposes of  applying this paragraph to all three United States shareholders (A, B,  and C), X is deemed to pay taxes in respect of Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obligation defined. For purposes of this section, the term  ``obligation'' means any bond, note, debenture, certificate, or other  evidence of indebtedness, and a debt recorded in the books of account of  both the creditor and the debtor. In the absence of legal, governmental,  or business reasons to the contrary, the indebtedness must bear interest  or be issued at a discount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dividends. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph and Sec. 1.954- 1(b)(2), the portion of a dividend which is attributable to foreign base  company shipping income is that amount which bears the   same ratio to the total dividend received as the earnings and profits  out of which such dividend is paid that are attributable to foreign base  company shipping income bears to the total earnings and profits out of  which such dividend is paid. For purposes of this subdivision, the  source of the earnings and profits out of which a distribution is made  shall be determined under section 316(a), except that the source of the  earnings and profits out of which a distribution is made by a controlled  foreign corporation with respect to stock owned (within the meaning of  section 958(a)) by a United States shareholder of such controlled  foreign corporation shall be determined under Sec. 1.959-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent of the one class  of stock of controlled foreign corporation X, which in turn owns 40  percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation Y. Y, which is  not (and has not been) either a controlled foreign corporation or a less  developed country shipping company, makes a distribution of $100 to X.  Under section 316(a), such distribution is made out of Y's earnings and  profits for 1978. Sixty percent of Y's earnings and profits for 1978 are  attributable to foreign base company shipping income. As a result, $60  of the $100 distribution constitutes foreign base company shipping  income to X under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that under  section 316(a) $20 of the $100 dividend is paid out of Y's earnings and  profits for 1979, and the other $80 is paid out of Y's earnings and  profits for 1978. Thirty percent of Y's earnings and profits for 1979  are attributable to foreign base company shipping income. Since 60  percent of Y's earnings and profits for 1978 are also attributable to  foreign base company shipping income, $54, i.e. (.60x$80)+(.30x$20), of  the $100 distribution constitutes foreign base company shipping income  to X under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that under  section 316(a) the $100 dividend is made out of Y's earnings and profits  for 1972. Since under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section foreign base  company shipping income does not include amounts earned by a foreign  corporation (not a less developed country shipping company) in a taxable  year beginning before January 1, 1978, no amount of such $100  distribution constitutes foreign base company shipping income to X under  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Domestic corporation N owns 100 percent of the one class  of stock of controlled foreign corporation S, which in turn owns 100  percent of the one class of stock of controlled foreign corporation T. T  makes a distribution of $100 to S, of which $80 is allocable under  Sec. 1.959-3 to earnings and profits for 1977 which are described in  Sec. 1.959-3(b)(2), and $20 is allocable to earnings and profits for  1978 which are described in Sec. 1.959-3(b)(3). The $80 amount is  excluded from S's gross income under section 959(b) and therefore is not  included in S's foreign base company shipping income. One hundred  percent of T's earnings and profits for 1978 described in Sec. 1.959- 3(b)(3) were attributable to reinvested foreign base company shipping  income. As a result, the entire $20 amount is included in S's foreign  base company shipping income under this paragraph.

The  foreign base company shipping income of any foreign corporation  includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Its distributive share of the gross income of any partnership,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any amounts includible in its gross income under section  652(a), 662(a), 671, or 691(a),  to the extent that such items would have been includible in its foreign  base company shipping income had they been realized by it directly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The application of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporations X and Y are equal  partners in partnership P. The taxable years end on December 31 for X,  June 30 for Y, and March 31 for P. In the fiscal year ending March 31,  1976, P's sole business activity is the use of a vessel in foreign  commerce. P derives gross income of $200 from the use of the vessel, and  incurs expenses, taxes, and other deductions of $160. Assume X's  distributive share of such  $200 of P's gross income is $100, all of which is includible in X's  gross income. If X had realized its distributive share of $100 directly,  then the amount which would have been includible in X's foreign base  company shipping income under this paragraph is the portion allocable to  the months of January, February, and March of 1976. Such amount, $25  (i.e., \1/2\ x $200 x 3 months/12 months), is included in X's foreign  base company shipping income for its taxable year ending December 31,  1976. Similarly, X is entitled under this paragraph to a deduction from  foreign base company shipping income of $20 (i.e., \1/2\ x $160 x 3  months/12 months). Since foreign base company shipping income does not  include amounts earned by a foreign corporation (not a less developed  country shipping corporation) in a taxable year beginning before January  1, 1976, Y has no foreign base   company shipping income (under this paragraph or otherwise) for its  taxable year beginning on July 1, 1975.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that P  incurs expenses, taxes, and deductions of $240 in its taxable year  ending on March 31, 1976. Accordingly, $25 is includible in X's foreign  base company shipping income, and the amount deductible therefrom under  this paragraph is $30 (i.e., \1/2\ x $240 x 3 months/12 months).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other income. Except as expressly provided in subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph, foreign base company shipping income does not include  any amount includible in the gross income of a controlled foreign  corporation under part I of subchapter J (section 641 and following,  relating to estates, trusts, and beneficiaries), and gains from the sale  or other disposition of any interest in an estate or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Additional rules--(1) Gross income. For purposes of this section  and Sec. 1.955A-2, the gross income of a foreign corporation (whether or  not a controlled foreign corporation) shall be determined in accordance  with the provisions of section 952 and Sec. 1.952-2. Thus, for example,  section 883 (relating to exclusions from gross income of foreign  corporations) is inapplicable under Sec. 1.952-2 (a)(1) and (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. In  addition, the gross income of a controlled foreign corporation shall be  determined, with respect to a United States shareholder of such  controlled foreign corporation, by excluding distributions received by  such corporation which are excluded from gross income under section  959(b) with respect to such shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Earnings and profits. For purposes of this section, the earnings  and profits of a foreign corporation (whether or not a controlled  foreign corporation) shall be determined in accordance with the  provisions of section 964 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No double counting. No item of gross income shall be counted as  foreign base company shipping income under more than one provision of  this section. For example, If $200 of gross income derived from the use  of a lighter is treated as foreign base company shipping income under  both paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, then such $200 is  counted only once as foreign base company shipping income. A taxpayer  may choose under which provision to include an item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Losses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally, if a controlled foreign corporation has  losses which are properly allocable to foreign base company shipping  income, the extent to which such losses are deductible from such income  shall be determined by treating such foreign corporation as a domestic  corporation and applying the principles of section 63. See Secs. 1.954- 1(c) and 1.952-2(b). Thus for example, losses from sales or exchanges of  capital assets are allowable only to the extent of gains from such sales  or exchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of any  stock or obligation would be treated (to any extent) as foreign base  company shipping income, then loss from such sale, exchange, or other  disposition is properly allocable to foreign base company shipping  income (to the same extent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the extent to which any loss on the disposition  of a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations is  deductible from foreign base company shipping income, it is immaterial  that such loss is taken into account under Sec. 1.955A-1(b)(1)(ii) as a  reduction in the amount of the decrease in (withdrawal from) qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> of this section  and Sec. 1.955A-2(a)(4)(ii)(A), gross income may be deemed to include  hypothetical arm's length charges for services performed by a controlled  foreign corporation for itself. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,  certain of these hypothetical charges may be treated as foreign based  company shipping income. Such hypothetical charges are deemed to be  income solely for purposes of applying the ``extent of use'' tests  prescribed by paragraph (d)(4) of this section and Sec. 1.955A-2(a)(4).  Charges for services performed by a controlled foreign corporation for  itself shall in no event be included in income for any other purposes.  [T.D. 7894, 48 FR 22523, May 19, 1983]</p>
