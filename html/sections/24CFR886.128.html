For cases involving termination of tenancy because of a failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, the procedures of 24 CFR parts 247 and 5 shall apply. For cases involving, or allegedly involving, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or criminal activity directly relating to such violence, the provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and concerning deferral of termination of assistance also shall apply.
