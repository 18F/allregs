When the applicable  T code or portable tank special provision, as referenced for materials  in the Sec. 172.101 Table of this subchapter, specifies that bottom  openings are prohibited, there must be no openings below the liquid  level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling  limit. When an existing opening is closed, it must be accomplished by  internally and externally welding one plate to the shell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bottom discharge outlets for portable tanks carrying certain  solid, crystallizable or highly viscous hazardous materials must be  equipped with at least two serially fitted and mutually independent  shut-off devices. Use of only two shut-off devices is only authorized  when this paragraph is referenced in the applicable T Code indicated for  each hazardous material in the Sec. 172.101 Table of this subchapter.  The design of the equipment must be to the satisfaction of the approval  agency and must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An external stop-valve fitted as close to the shell as  reasonably practicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A liquid tight closure at the end of the discharge pipe, which  may be a bolted blank flange or a screw cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, every  bottom discharge outlet must be equipped with three serially fitted and  mutually independent shut-off devices.

The thermal means of  activation must activate at a temperature of not more than 250 F (121  C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pressure relief devices. All portable tanks must be fitted with  at least one pressure relief device. All relief devices must be  designed, constructed and marked in accordance with the requirements of  this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vacuum-relief devices. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A shell which is to be equipped with  a vacuum-relief device must be designed to withstand, without permanent  deformation, an external pressure of not less than 0.21 bar (21.0 kPa).  The vacuum-relief device must be set to relieve at a vacuum setting not  greater than -0.21 bar (-21.0 kPa) unless the shell is designed for a  higher external over pressure, in which case the vacuum-relief pressure  of the device to be fitted must not be greater than the tank design  vacuum pressure. A shell that is not fitted with a vacuum-relief device  must be designed to withstand, without permanent deformation, an  external pressure of not less than 0.4 bar (40.0 kPa).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vacuum-relief devices used on portable tanks intended for the  transportation of hazardous materials meeting the criteria of Class 3,  including elevated temperature hazardous materials transported at or  above their   flash point, must prevent the immediate passage of flame into the shell  or the portable tank must have a shell capable of withstanding, without  leakage, an internal explosion resulting from the passage of flame into  the shell.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pressure relief devices. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each portable tank with a capacity  not less than 1,900 liters (501.9 gallons) and every independent  compartment of a portable tank with a similar capacity, must be provided  with one or more pressure relief devices of the reclosing type. Such  portable tanks may, in addition, have a frangible disc or fusible  element in parallel with the reclosing devices, except when the  applicable T code assigned to a hazardous material requires that the  frangible disc precede the pressure relief device, according to  paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or when no bottom openings are  allowed. The pressure relief devices must have sufficient capacity to  prevent rupture of the shell due to over pressurization or vacuum  resulting from filling, discharging, heating of the contents or fire.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of  foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development of any  dangerous excess pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When required for certain hazardous materials by the applicable  T code or portable tank special provision specified for a hazardous  material in the Sec. 172.101 Table of this subchapter, portable tanks  must have a pressure relief device consistent with the requirements of  this subchapter. Except for a portable tank in dedicated service that is  fitted with an approved relief device constructed of materials  compatible with the hazardous material, the relief device system must  include a frangible disc preceding (such as, between the lading and the  reclosing pressure relief device) a reclosing pressure relief device. A  pressure gauge or suitable tell-tale indicator for the detection of disc  rupture, pin-holing or leakage must be provided in the space between the  frangible disc and the pressure relief device to allow the portable tank  operator to check to determine if the disc is leak free. The frangible  disc must rupture at a nominal pressure 10% above the start-to-discharge  pressure of the reclosable pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Every portable tank with a capacity less than 1,900 liters  (501.9 gallons) must be fitted with a pressure relief device which,  except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, may be a  frangible disc when this disc is set to rupture at a nominal pressure  equal to the test pressure at any temperature within the design  temperature range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the shell is fitted for pressure discharge, a suitable  pressure relief device must provide the inlet line to the portable tank  and set to operate at a pressure not higher than the MAWP of the shell,  and a stop-valve must be fitted as close to the shell as practicable to  minimize the potential for damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Setting of pressure relief devices. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pressure relief devices  must operate only in conditions of excessive rise in temperature. The  shell must not be subject to undue fluctuations of pressure during  normal conditions of transportation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The required pressure relief device must be set to start to  discharge at a nominal pressure of five-sixths of the test pressure for  shells having a test pressure of not more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa) and  110% of two-thirds of the test pressure for shells having a test  pressure of more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa). A self-closing relief device  must close at a pressure not more than 10% below the pressure at which  the discharge starts. The device must remain closed at all lower  pressures. This requirement does not prevent the use of vacuum-relief or  combination pressure relief and vacuum-relief devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fusible elements. Fusible elements must operate at a temperature  between 110 C (230 F) and 149 C (300.2 F), provided that the  pressure in the shell at the fusing temperature will not exceed the test  pressure. They must be placed at the top of the shell with their inlets  in the vapor space and in no case may they be shielded from external  heat. Fusible elements must not be utilized on portable tanks with a  test pressure which exceeds 2.65 bar (265.0 kPa); however, fusible  elements are authorized   on portable tanks for the transportation of certain organometallic  materials in accordance with Sec. 172.102, special provision TP36 of  this subchapter. Fusible elements used on portable tanks intended for  the transport of elevated temperature hazardous materials must be  designed to operate at a temperature higher than the maximum temperature  that will be experienced during transport and must be designed to the  satisfaction of the approval agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Capacity of pressure relief devices. (1) The reclosing pressure  relief device required by paragraph (g)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section must have a  minimum cross sectional flow area equivalent to an orifice of 31.75 mm  (1.3 inches) diameter. Vacuum-relief devices, when used, must have a  cross sectional flow area not less than 284 mm \2\ (11.2 inches \2\).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To determine the total required capacity of the relief  devices, which must be regarded as being the sum of the individual  capacities of all the contributing devices, the following formula must  be used: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01OC08.000  Where:  Q = minimum required rate of discharge in cubic meters of air per second</p><p class="depth5"><em>(m\3\/s)</em> at conditions: 1 bar and 0 C (273 K); F = for uninsulated shells: 1; for insulated shells: U(649-t)/13.6 but</p><p class="depth5">in no case is less than 0.25 Where:  U = thermal conductance of the insulation, in kW</p><p class="depth5">m-2K-1, at 38 C (100 F); and t =</p><p class="depth5">actual temperature of the hazardous material during filling</p><p class="depth5">(in C) or when this temperature is unknown, let t = 15 C (59</p><p class="depth5">F).
