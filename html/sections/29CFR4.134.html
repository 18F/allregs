                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contracts entered into by agencies other than those of the Federal Government or the District of Columbia as described in Sec. Sec. 4.107-4.108 are not within the purview of the Act. Thus, the Act does not cover service contracts entered into with any agencies of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or Guam acting in behalf of their respective local governments. Similarly, it does not cover

service contracts entered into by agencies of States or local public bodies, not acting as agents for or on behalf of the United States or the District of Columbia, even though Federal financial assistance may be provided for such contracts under Federal law or the terms and conditions specified in Federal law may govern the award and operation of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Further, as already noted in Sec. Sec. 4.111 through 4.113, the Act does not apply to Government contracts which do not have as their principal purpose the furnishing of services, or which call for no services to be furnished within the United States or through the use of service employees as those terms are defined in the Act. Clearly outside the Act's coverage for these reasons are such contracts as those for the purchase of tangible products which the Government needs (e.g. vehicles, office equipment, and supplies), for the logistic support of an air base in a foreign country, or for the services of a lawyer to examine the title to land. Similarly, where the Government contracts for a lease of building space for Government occupancy and the building owner furnishes general janitorial and other building services on an incidental basis through the use of service employees, the leasing of the space rather than the furnishing of the building services is the principal purpose of the contract, and the Act does not apply. Another type of contract which is outside the coverage of the Act because it is not for the principal purpose of furnishing services may be illustrated by a contract for the rental of parking space under which the Government agency is simply given a lease or license to use the contractor's real property. Such a contract is to be distinguished from contracts for the storage of vehicles which are delivered into the possession or custody of the contractor, who will provide the required services including the parking or retrieval of the vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There are a number of types of contracts which, while outside the Act's coverage in the usual case, may be subject to its provisions under the conditions and circumstances of a particular procurement, because these may be such as to require a different view of the principal purpose of the contract. Thus, the ordinary contract for the recapping of tires would have as its principal purpose the manufacture and furnishing of rebuilt tires for the Government rather than the furnishing of services through the use of service employees, and thus would be outside the Act's coverage. Similarly, contracts calling for printing, reproduction, and duplicating ordinarily would appear to have as their principal purpose the furnishing in quantity of printed, reproduced or duplicated written materials rather than the furnishing of reproduction services through the use of service employees. However, in a particular case, the terms, conditions, and circumstances of the procurement may be such that the facts would show its purpose to be chiefly the furnishing of services (e.g. repair services, typesetting, photocopying, editing, etc.), and where such services require the use of service employees the contract would be subject to the Act unless excluded therefrom for some other reason.
