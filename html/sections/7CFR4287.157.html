                                Sec. 4287.157  Liquidation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In the event of one or more incidents of default or third party  actions that the borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a  reasonable period of time, liquidation may be considered. If the lender  concludes that liquidation is necessary, it must request the Agency's  concurrence. The lender will liquidate the loan unless the Agency, at  its option, carries out liquidation. When the decision to liquidate is  made, if the loan has not already been repurchased, provisions will be  made for repurchase in accordance with Sec. 4279.78 of subpart A of  part 4279 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decision to liquidate. A decision to liquidate shall be made  when it is determined that the default cannot be cured through actions  contained in Sec. 4287.145 of this subpart or it has been determined  that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the lender to  liquidate. The decision to liquidate or continue with the borrower must  be made as soon as possible when any of the following exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A loan has been delinquent 90 days and the lender and borrower  have not been able to cure the delinquency through one of the actions  contained in Sec. 4287.145 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It has been determined that delaying liquidation will jeopardize  full recovery on the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The borrower or lender has been uncooperative in resolving the  problem and the Agency or the lender has reason to believe the borrower  is not acting in good faith, and it would enhance the position of the  guarantee to liquidate immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liquidation by the Agency. The Agency may require the lender to  assign the security instruments to the Agency if the Agency, at its  option, decides to liquidate the loan. When the Agency liquidates,  reasonable liquidation expenses will be assessed against the proceeds  derived from the sale of the collateral. Form FmHA 1980-45, ``Notice of  Liquidation Responsibility,'' will be forwarded to the Finance Office  when the Agency liquidates the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of liquidation plan. The lender will, within 30 days  after a decision to liquidate, submit to the Agency in writing its  proposed detailed method of liquidation. Upon approval by the Agency of  the liquidation plan, the lender will commence liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lender's liquidation plan. The liquidation plan must include,  but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's  ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note and related security  instruments and a copy of the payment ledger if available which reflects  the current loan balance and accrued interest to date and the method of  computing the interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A full and complete list of all collateral including any  personal and corporate guarantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum  collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such  methods, including recommended action:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For acquiring and disposing of all collateral; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To collect from guarantors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Copies of the guarantor's latest available financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to  be incurred along with justification for each expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress  of liquidation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Estimated protective advance amounts with justification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at  auction and a breakdown to show how the amounts were determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to  be credited to the guaranteed debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Legal opinions, if needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> If the outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest is  less than $200,000, the lender will obtain an estimate of fair market  and potential liquidation value of the collateral. If the outstanding  balance of principal and accrued interest is $200,000 or more, the  lender will obtain an independent appraisal report meeting the  requirements of Sec. 4279.144 of subpartB of part 4279 of this chapter  on all collateral securing the loan which will reflect the fair market  value and potential liquidation value. In order to formulate a  liquidation plan which maximizes recovery, collateral must be evaluated  for the release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other  environmental hazards which may adversely impact the market value of the  collateral. The appraisal shall consider this aspect. The independent  appraiser's fee, including the cost of the environmental site  assessment, will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approval of liquidation plan. The Agency will inform the lender  in writing whether it concurs in the lender's liquidation plan. Should  the Agency and the lender not agree on the liquidation plan,  negotiations will take place between the Agency and the lender to  resolve the disagreement. When the liquidation plan is approved by the  Agency, the lender will proceed expeditiously with liquidation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transfer and assumption of the borrower's operation can be  accomplished before or after the loan goes into liquidation. However, if  the collateral has been purchased through foreclosure or the borrower  has conveyed title to the lender, no transfer and assumption is  permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A protective bid may be made by the lender, with prior Agency  written approval, at a foreclosure sale to protect the lender's and the  Agency's interest. The protective bid will not exceed the amount of the  loan, including expenses of foreclosure, and should be based on the  liquidation value considering estimated expenses for holding and  reselling the property. These expenses include, but are not limited to,  expenses for resale, interest accrual, length of time necessary for  resale, maintenance, guard service, weatherization, and prior liens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Acceleration. The lender, or the Agency if it liquidates, will  proceed to accelerate the indebtedness as expeditiously as possible when  acceleration is necessary including giving any notices and taking any  other legal actions required. A copy of the acceleration notice or other  acceleration document will be sent to the Agency (or lender if the  Agency liquidates). The guaranteed loan will be considered in  liquidation once the loan has been accelerated and a demand for payment  has been made upon the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Filing an estimated loss claim. When the lender is conducting  the liquidation and owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the  loan, the lender will file an estimated loss claim once a decision has  been made to liquidate if the liquidation will exceed 90 days. The  estimated loss payment will be based on the liquidation value of the  collateral. For the purpose of reporting and loss claim computation, the  lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan in  accordance with Agency procedures, and the loss claim will be promptly  processed in accordance with applicable Agency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accounting and reports. When the lender conducts liquidation, it  will account for funds during the period of liquidation and will provide  the Agency with reports at least quarterly on the progress of  liquidation including disposition of collateral, resulting costs, and  additional procedures necessary for successful completion of the  liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Transmitting payments and proceeds to the Agency. When the  Agency is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan, the lender  will transmit to the Agency its pro rata share of any payments received  from the borrower; liquidation; or other proceeds using Form FmHA 1980- 43, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Abandonment of collateral. There may be instances when the cost  of liquidation would exceed the potential recovery value of the  collection. The lender, with proper documentation and concurrence of the  Agency, may abandon the collateral in lieu of liquidation. A proposed  abandonment will be considered a servicing action requiring the  appropriate environmental review by the Agency in accordance with  subpart G of part 1940 of this title. Examples where abandonment may be  considered include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of liquidation is increased or the value of the  collateral is decreased by environmental issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The collateral is functionally or economically obsolete;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There are superior liens held by other parties in excess of the  value of the collateral;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The collateral has deteriorated; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The collateral is specialized and there is little or no demand  for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Disposition of personal or corporate guarantees. The lender  should take action to maximize recovery from all collateral, including  personal and corporate guarantees. The lender will seek a deficiency  judgment when there is a reasonable chance of future collection of the  judgment. The lender must make a decision whether or not to seek a  deficiency judgment when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A borrower voluntarily liquidates the collateral, but the sale  fails to pay the guaranteed indebtedness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The collateral is voluntarily conveyed to the lender, but the  borrower and personal and corporate guarantors are not released from  liability; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A liquidation plan is being developed for forced liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Compromise settlement. A compromise settlement may be considered  at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender and the Agency must receive complete financial  information on all parties obligated for the loan and must be satisfied  that the statements reflect the true and correct financial position of  the debtor including all assets. Adequate consideration must be received  before a release from liability is issued. Adequate consideration  includes money, additional security, or other benefit to the goals and  objectives of the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before a personal guarantor can be released from liability, the  following factors must be considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cash, either lump sum or over a period of time, or other  consideration offered by the guarantor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Age and health of the guarantor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Potential income of the guarantor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inheritance prospects of the guarantor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Availability of the guarantor's assets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Possibility that the guarantor's assets have been concealed or  improperly transferred; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Effect of other guarantors on the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once the Agency and the lender agree on a reasonable amount that  is fair and adequate, the lender can proceed to effect the settlement  compromise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A compromise will only be accepted if it is in the best interest  of the Agency.</p>
