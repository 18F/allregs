                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Magnesium oxide (MgO, CAS Reg. No. 1309-48-4) occurs naturally as the colorless, crystalline mineral periclase. It is produced either as a bulky white powder (light) or a relatively dense white powder (heavy) by heating magnesium hydroxide or carbonate. Heating these magnesium salts under moderate conditions (400 to 900 C for a few hours) produces light magnesium oxide. Heating the salts under more rigorous conditions (1200 C for 12 hours) produces heavy magnesium oxide. Light magnesium oxide is converted to heavy magnesium oxide by sustained heating at high temperatures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed. (1981), p. 178, which is incorporated by reference.
