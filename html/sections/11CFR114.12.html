                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An organization may incorporate and not be subject to the  provisions of this part if the organization incorporates for liability  purposes only, and if the organization is a political committee as  defined in 11 CFR 100.5. Notwithstanding the corporate status of the  political committee, the treasurer of an incorporated political  committee remains personally responsible for carrying out their  respective duties under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A corporation or labor organization may not pay the  employer's share of the cost of fringe benefits, such as health and life  insurance and retirement, for employees or members on leave-without-pay  to participate in political campaigns of Federal candidates. The  separate segregated fund of a corporation or a labor organization may  pay the employer's share of fringe benefits, and such payment would be a  contribution in-kind to the candidate. An employee or member may, out of  unreimbursed personal funds, assure the continuity of his or her fringe  benefits during absence from work for political campaigning, and such  payment would not be a contribution in-kind.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service credit for periods of leave-without-pay is not  considered compensation for purposes of this section if the employer  normally gives identical treatment to employees placed on leave-without- pay for nonpolitical purposes.
