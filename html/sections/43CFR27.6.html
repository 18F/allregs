                            <p class="depth0">Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of these regulations,  or within sixty (60) days from the commencement of a Federal  authorization to which this part applies, whichever occurs later,  recipients of Federal authorizations to which this part applies, shall  prepare and submit an affirmative action plan for each of their  establishments to which this part applies, to assure that the  requirements of this part will be met. In addition, recipients and each  of their prime contractors and subcontractors shall require each  contractor and subcontractor with a contract of $50,000 or more and 50  or more employees to develop within sixty (60) days from the  commencement of the contract and to keep on file a written affirmative  action plan for each of its establishments, to which this part applies,  with the exception of those establishments which the Department  Compliance Officer determines are in all respects separate and distinct  from performance of the activities of the prime contractor or  subcontractor conducted under the Federal authorizations. Such plans  shall include a set of specific and result-oriented procedures which the  recipient, contractor or subcontractor commits itself to apply every  good faith effort to achieve equal opportunity in all aspects of its  operations. An acceptable program must include an analysis of all areas  of operation of the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor in which it  could be deficient in offering services, opportunities, or benefits to  minority groups and women, and all areas of employment in which it could  be deficient in the utilization of minority groups and women and all  areas of contracting in which it could be deficient in the utilization  of minority business enterprises, and, further, specific goals and  specific timetables to which its efforts will be directed, to correct  all deficiencies and thus to increase materially the participation of  minorities and women in all aspects of its operation. The implementing  affirmative action plans shall include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Services, financial aids, and other benefits. The implementing  program is required to specifically address all   areas of operation of the recipient, contractor or subcontractor which  offer and provide services, financial aids, and other benefits; it shall  identify those services, financial aids, and benefits; analyze the  opportunities available to minorities and women in each area; and set  forth affirmative action, including goals and time- tables, which will  be taken to materially increase participation of minorities and women.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employment practices. The implementing plan shall address all  aspects of employment operations and is required to contain all analyses  and commitments, including goals and timetables, which are required in  rules, regulations, and orders implementing Executive Order 11246, as  amended, and to include additional commitments to employment goals for  minorities and women in construction operations, to the extent that  those goals are not established under Executive Order 11246.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting practices. Recipients to which this part applies and  each of their contractors and subcontractors with a contract of $150,000  or more shall also include in their affirmative action plan a program in  which the recipient, contractor or subcontractor agrees to take specific  affirmative action as set forth below to utilize minority business  enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers. For this purpose, the term  minority business enterprise means a business enterprise that is owned  or controlled by minority group members or women. The plan shall  identify specific actions which the recipient, contractor or  subcontractor will take to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designate a liaison officer who will administer the minority  business enterprises program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities  of minority business enterprises in all contracting decisions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Afford minority business enterprises an equitable opportunity to  compete for contracts and subcontracts by arranging solicitations, time  for preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery  schedules so as to facilitiate the participation of minority business  enterprises;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit periodic reports of contracting opportunities,  procedures, and awards to minority business enterprises, at such times,  and in such form, and containing such information as the Department  Compliance Officer may prescribe, including reports showing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Procedures which have been adopted to comply with the policies  set forth in this clause, including the establishment of a source list  of minority business enterprises;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Awards to minority business enterprises on the source lists,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specific efforts to identify and award contracts to minority  business enterprises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Establish specific goals and timetables to utilize minority  business enterprises in the performance of contracts awarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inform minority business enterprises and organizations of  minority business enterprises of contracting opportunities and  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cooperate with the Department Compliance Officer in any studies  and surveys of the recipient's minority business enterprise procedures  and practices that the Department Compliance Officer may from time to  time conduct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Assist potential minority business enterprises in obtaining and  maintaining suitable bonding capabilities, in those instances where  bonds are required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemption. Contracts and subcontracts are exempt from the  requirements of the equal opportunity clause with regard to work  performed outside the United States by employees who were not recruited  within the United States.</p>
