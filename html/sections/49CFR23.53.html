                                Sec. 23.53  How do car rental companies count ACDBE participation
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a car rental company, you may, in meeting the goal the  airport has set for you, include purchases or leases of vehicles from  any vendor that is a certified ACDBE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As a car rental company, if you choose to meet the goal the  airport has set for you by including purchases or leases of vehicles  from an ACDBE vendor, you must also submit to the recipient  documentation of the good faith efforts you have made to obtain ACDBE  participation from other ACDBE providers of goods and services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> While this part does not require you to obtain ACDBE  participation through direct ownership arrangements, you may count such  participation toward the goal the airport has set for you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following special rules apply to counting participation  related to car rental operations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Count the entire amount of the cost charged by an ACDBE for  repairing vehicles, provided that it is reasonable and not excessive as  compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Count the entire amount of the fee or commission charged by a  ACDBE to manage a car rental concession under an agreement with the  concessionaire toward ACDBE goals, provided that it is reasonable and  not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Do not count any portion of a fee paid by a manufacturer to a  car dealership for reimbursement of work performed under the  manufacturer's warranty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For other goods and services, count participation toward ACDBE  goals as provided in part 26, Sec. 26.55 and Sec. 23.55 of this part.  In the event of any conflict between these two sections, Sec. 23.55  controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you have a national or regional contract, count a pro-rated  share of the amount of that contract toward the goals of each airport  covered by the contract. Use the proportion of your applicable gross  receipts as the basis for making this pro-rated assignment of ACDBE  participation.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (f): Car Rental Company X signs a regional  contract with an ACDBE car dealer to supply cars to all five airports in  a state. The five airports each account for 20 percent of X's gross  receipts in the state. Twenty percent of the value of the cars purchased  through the ACDBE car dealer would count toward the goal of each  airport.</p>
