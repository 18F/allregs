                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. The State must provide assurances that necessary safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of enrollees in State plan HCBS, and must define in writing standards for providers (both agencies and individuals) of HCBS and for agents conducting individualized independent evaluation, independent assessment, and service plan development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conflict of interest standards. The State must define conflict of interest standards that ensure the independence of individual and agency agents who conduct (whether as a service or an administrative activity) the independent evaluation of eligibility for State plan HCBS, who are responsible for the independent assessment of need for HCBS, or who are responsible for the development of the service plan. The conflict of interest standards apply to all individuals and entities, public or private. At a minimum, these agents must not be any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Related by blood or marriage to the individual, or to any paid caregiver of the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financially responsible for the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Empowered to make financial or health-related decisions on behalf of the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Holding financial interest, as defined in Sec.  411.354 of this chapter, in any entity that is paid to provide care for the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Providers of State plan HCBS for the individual, or those who have an interest in or are employed by a provider of State plan HCBS for the individual, except when the State demonstrates that the only willing and qualified agent to perform independent assessments and develop person-centered service plans in a geographic area also provides HCBS, and the State devises conflict of interest protections including separation of agent and provider functions within provider entities, which are described in the State plan for medical assistance and approved by the Secretary, and individuals are provided with a clear and accessible alternative dispute resolution process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Training. Qualifications for agents performing independent assessments and plans of care must include training in assessment of individuals whose physical, cognitive, or mental conditions trigger a potential need for home and community-based services and supports, and current knowledge of available resources, service options, providers, and best practices to improve health and quality of life outcomes.</p>
