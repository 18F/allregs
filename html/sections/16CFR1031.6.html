                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The extent of Commission involvement will be dependent upon the  Commission's interest in the particular standards development activity  and the Commission's priorities and resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission's interest in a specific voluntary standards  activity will be based in part on the frequency and severity of injuries  associated with the product, the involvement of the product in  accidents, the susceptibility of the hazard to correction through  standards, and the overall resources and priorities of the Commission.  Commission involvement in voluntary standards activities generally will  be guided by the Commission's operating plan and performance budget.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commission involvement in voluntary standards activities varies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission staff may maintain an awareness of the voluntary  standards development process through oral or written inquiries,  receiving and reviewing minutes of meetings and copies of draft  standards, or attending meetings for the purpose of observing and  commenting during the standards development process in accordance with  subpart B of this part. For example, Commission staff may respond to  requests from voluntary standards organizations, standards development  committees, trade associations and consumer organizations; by providing  information concerning the risks of injury associated with particular  products, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data,  death, injury, and incident data, summaries and analyses of in-depth  investigation reports; discussing Commission goals and objectives with  regard to voluntary standards and improved consumer product safety;  responding to requests for information concerning Commission programs;  and initiating contacts with voluntary standards organizations to  discuss cooperative voluntary standards activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employee involvement may include membership as defined in Sec.  1031.10(a). Commission staff may regularly attend meetings of a standard  development committee or group and take an active part in the  discussions of the committee and in developing the standard, in  accordance with subpart B of this part. The Commission may contribute to  the deliberations of the committee by expending resources to provide  technical assistance (e.g., research, engineering support, and  information and education programs) and administrative assistance (e.g.,  travel costs, hosting meetings, and secretarial functions) in support of  the development and implementation of those voluntary standards  referenced in the Commission's operating plan, performance budget, mid- year review, or other official Commission document. The Commission may  also support voluntary standards activities as described in Sec.  1031.7. Employee involvement may include observation as defined in Sec.  1031.10(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Normally, the total amount of Commission support given to a  voluntary standards activity shall be no greater than that of all non- Federal participants in that activity, except   where it is in the public interest to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event of duplication of effort by two or more groups  (either inside or outside the Commission) in developing a voluntary  standard for the same product or class of products, the Commission shall  encourage the several groups to cooperate in the development of a single  voluntary standard.</p>
