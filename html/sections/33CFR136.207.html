However, in order to facilitate the processing of these claims with respect to a single incident where multiple trustees are involved and to prevent double recovery, the affected trustees should select a lead administrative trustee who will present consolidated claims on behalf of the trustees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A trustee may present a claim for the reasonable cost of assessing natural resources damages separately from a claim for the cost of developing and implementing plans for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the natural resources damaged.</p>
