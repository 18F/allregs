                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Glucono delta-lactone (C6H10O6, CAS Reg. No. 90-80-2), also called D-gluconic acid delta-lactone or D-glucono-1,5-lactone, is the cyclic 1,5-intramolecular ester of D-gluconic acid. It is prepared by direct crystallization from the aqueous solution of gluconic acid. Gluconic acid may be produced by the oxidation of D-glucose with bromine water, by the oxidation of D-glucose by microorganisms that are nonpathogenic and nontoxicogenic to man or other animals, or by the oxidation of D-glucose with enzymes derived from these microorganisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed.
