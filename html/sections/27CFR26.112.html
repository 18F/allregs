                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Returns. The taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), (equal to the taxes imposed in the United States by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), 5041, or 5051), the payment of which has been deferred under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 26.80, 26.95 or 26.104 of this part, shall be paid pursuant to a return on TTB Form 5000.25 prepared in accordance with the instructions on the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Return periods. (1) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly return period. A taxpayer may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return shall be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the

taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date shall be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following additional rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A ``taxpayer'' is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Reasonably expects'' means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the tax liability for all locations with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits, wine, or beer excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT shall be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in distilled spirits, wine, or beer taxes during that calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax liability during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the semimonthly return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly payments only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Filing. (1) The original of TTB Form 5000.25, with remittance covering the full amount of the tax, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The original of TTB Form 5000.25, with remittance covering the full amount of the tax, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tax shall be paid in full by remittance at the time the return is filed, unless the proprietor is required to make remittances by electronic fund transfer in accordance with Sec. 26.112a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The remittance may be in any form that is authorized to be accepted under the provisions of Sec. 70.61 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When the return and remittance are delivered by U.S. mail to the office of the appropriate TTB officer, the date of the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return and remittance were mailed shall be treated as the date of delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return. (1) Division of second semimonthly period. (i) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later than September 29.

In the case of taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required by Sec. 26.112a, the

second semimonthly period of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, no later than September 28.

(i) General. Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General.

Sec. 26.112a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment by cash, check, or money order, of distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, as described in Sec. 26.112, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on each type of product for which taxes are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importation during the calendar year, without

regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises at which tax liabilities are incurred by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year.

Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships.

The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in Sec. 26.112 or Sec. 26.113.

Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account.

will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedure.

This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs Service.
