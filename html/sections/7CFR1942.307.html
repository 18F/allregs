To avoid duplicate assistance, the  grantee shall coordinate with FS and Rural Business-Cooperative Service  (RBS) to ascertain if a grant has been made in a substantially similar  geographical or defined local area in a State for technical assistance  under the above program. The grantee will provide documentation to FS  and RBS regarding the contact with each agency. Under its program, the  FS assists rural communities dependent upon national forest resources by  establishing rural forestry and economic diversification action teams  which prepare action plans. Action plans are intended to provide  opportunities to promote economic diversification and enhance local  economies dependent upon national forest resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At least 51 percent of the outstanding interest in the project  has membership or is owned by those who are either citizens of the  United States or reside in the United States after being legally  admitted for permanent residence.
