This means must not be readily available to the flightcrew so that it could be operated inadvertently or by habitual reflexive action. When an alert is suppressed, there must be a clear and unmistakable annunciation to the flightcrew that the alert has been suppressed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Visual alert indications must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conform to the following color convention:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Red for warning alert indications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amber or yellow for caution alert indications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any color except red or green for advisory alert indications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use visual coding techniques, together with other alerting function elements on the flight deck, to distinguish between warning, caution, and advisory alert indications, if they are presented on monochromatic displays that are not capable of conforming to the color convention in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of the colors red, amber, and yellow on the flight deck for functions other than flightcrew alerting must be limited and must not adversely affect flightcrew alerting.
