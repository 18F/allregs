Recipients may either use cash (hard-match), in- kind (soft-match) contributions, or a combination of in-kind plus hard- match to meet this requirement. In-kind (soft-match) contributions are  in addition to the maintenance of effort required of recipients of grant  awards. The types of contributions allowed are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any funds from a State, local, or other non-Federal source used  for an eligible activity as defined in Sec. 110.40 in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dollar equivalent value of an eligible activity as defined  in Sec. 110.40 of this part provided by a State, local, or other non- Federal source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The value of participants' salary while attending a planning or  training activity contained in the approved grant application provided  by a State, local, or other non-Federal source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional types of in-kind contributions the Associate  Administrator deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Funds used for matching purposes under any other Federal grant  or cooperative agreement may not be used for matching purposes.
