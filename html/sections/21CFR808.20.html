                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any State or political subdivision may apply to the Food and  Drug Administration for an exemption from preemption for any requirement  that it has enacted and that is preempted. An exemption may only be  granted for a requirement that has been enacted, promulgated, or issued  in final form by the authorized body or official of the State or  political subdivision so as to have the force and effect of law.  However, an application for exemption may be submitted before the  effective date of the requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application for exemption shall be in the form of a letter to  the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and shall be signed by an individual  who is authorized to request the exemption on behalf of the State or  political subdivision. An original and two copies of the letter and any  accompanying material, as well as any subsequent reports or  correspondence concerning an application, shall be submitted to the  Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,  5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The outside wrapper of  any application, report, or correspondence should indicate that it  concerns an application for exemption from preemption of device  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each requirement for which an exemption is sought, the  application   shall include the following information to the fullest extent possible,  or an explanation of why such information has not been included:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification and a current copy of any statute, rule,  regulation, or ordinance of the State or political subdivision  considered by the State or political subdivision to be a requirement  which is preempted, with a reference to the date of enactment,  promulgation, or issuance in final form. The application shall also  include, where available, copies of any legislative history or  background materials pertinent to enactment, promulgation, or issuance  of the requirement, including hearing reports or studies concerning  development or consideration of the requirement. If the requirement has  been subject to any judicial or administrative interpretations, the  State or political subdivision shall furnish copies of such judicial or  administrative interpretations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A comparison of the requirement of the State or political  subdivision and any applicable Federal requirements to show similarities  and differences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information on the nature of the problem addressed by the  requirement of the State or political subdivision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identification of which (or both) of the following bases is  relied upon for seeking an exemption from preemption:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requirement is more stringent than a requirement applicable  to a device under the act. If the State or political subdivision relies  upon this basis for exemption from preemption, the application shall  include information, data, or material showing how and why the  requirement of the State or political subdivision is more stringent than  requirements under the act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirement is required by compelling local conditions, and  compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in  violation of any applicable requirement under the act. If the State or  political subdivision relies upon this basis for exemption from  preemption, the application shall include information, data, or material  showing why compliance with the requirement of the State or political  subdivision would not cause a device to be in violation of any  applicable requirement under the act and why the requirement is required  by compelling local conditions. The application shall also explain in  detail the compelling local conditions that justify the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The title of the chief administrative or legal officers of that  State or local agency that has primary responsibility for administration  of the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When requested by the Food and Drug Administration, any records  concerning administration of any requirement which is the subject of an  exemption or an application for an exemption from preemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Information on how the public health may be benefitted and how  interstate commerce may be affected, if an exemption is granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any other pertinent information respecting the requirement  voluntarily submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If litigation regarding applicability of the requirement is  pending, the State or political subdivision may so indicate in its  application and request expedited action on such application.
