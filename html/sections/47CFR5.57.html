The attorney shall in that event separately set forth  the reason why the application is not signed by the applicant. In  addition, if any matter is stated on the basis of the attorney's belief  only (rather than his/her knowledge), he/she shall separately set forth  reasons for believing that such statements are true.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only the original of applications, amendments, or related  statements of fact need be signed; copies may be conformed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications, amendments, and related statements of fact need  not be submitted under oath.
