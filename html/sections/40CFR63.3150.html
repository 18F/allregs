                            <p class="depth0">You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of Sec. 63.3151. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.3083 and ends on the last day of the month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next month. You must determine the mass average organic HAP content of the materials used each month for each group of materials for which an emission limitation is established in Sec. 63.3090(c) and (d) or Sec. 63.3091(c) and (d). The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to Sec. 63.3151 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period, the mass average organic HAP content for each group of materials was equal to or less than the applicable emission limits in Sec. 63.3090(c) and (d) or Sec. 63.3091(c) and (d).</p>
