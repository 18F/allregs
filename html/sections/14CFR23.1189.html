For those installations where  the flammable fluid that escapes after shutdown cannot be limited to one  quart, it must be demonstrated that this greater amount can be safely  contained or drained overboard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There must be means to guard against inadvertent operation of  each shutoff means, and to make it possible for the crew to reopen the  shutoff means in flight after it has been closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Turbine engine installations need not have an engine oil system  shutoff if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The oil tank is integral with, or mounted on, the engine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All oil system components external to the engine are fireproof  or located in areas not subject to engine fire conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Power operated valves must have means to indicate to the flight  crew when the valve has reached the selected position and must be  designed so that the valve will not move from the selected position  under vibration conditions likely to exist at the valve location.
