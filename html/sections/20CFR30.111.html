                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except where otherwise provided in the Act and these  regulations, the claimant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance  of the evidence the existence of each and every criterion necessary to  establish eligibility under any compensable claim category set forth in  Sec. 30.110. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence means that it is  more likely than not that the proposition to be proved is true. Subject  to the exceptions expressly provided in the Act and the regulations in  this part, the claimant also bears the burden of providing to OWCP all  written medical documentation, contemporaneous records, or other records  and documents necessary to establish any and all criteria for benefits  set forth in these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event that the claim lacks required information or  supporting documentation, OWCP will notify the claimant of the  deficiencies and provide him or her an opportunity for correction of the  deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written affidavits or declarations, subject to penalty for  perjury, by the employee, survivor or any other person, will be accepted  as evidence of employment history and survivor relationship for purposes  of establishing eligibility and may be relied on in determining whether  a claim meets the requirements of the Act for benefits if, and only if,  such person attests that due diligence was used to obtain records in  support of the claim, but that no records exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A claimant will not be entitled to any presumption otherwise  provided for in these regulations if substantial   evidence exists that rebuts the existence of the fact that is the  subject of the presumption. Substantial evidence means such relevant  evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a  conclusion. When such evidence exists, the claimant shall be notified  and afforded the opportunity to submit additional written medical  documentation or records.</p>
