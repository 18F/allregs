                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nondiscrimination requirement. For any mortgage described in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section that HUD sells without FHA mortgage insurance, the project owner shall not unreasonably refuse to lease a dwelling unit offered for rent, offer to sell cooperative stock, or otherwise discriminate in the terms of tenancy or cooperative purchase and sale because any tenant or purchaser is a certificate or voucher holder under 24 CFR part 982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inapplicability to current mortgages securing unsubsidized projects that receive no project based-assistance. The nondiscrimination requirements of this

section do not apply to any mortgage that is current under the terms of the mortgage at the time HUD offers it for sale, if the mortgage secures an unsubsidized project that does not receive any of the forms of project-based assistance enumerated in paragraphs (4)(i) to (4)(iv) of the ``subsidized project'' definition in Sec. 290.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability to mortgages securing unsubsidized projects receiving project-based assistance (partially-assisted projects) or securing subsidized projects. (1) The nondiscrimination requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to the project owner upon the sale of a mortgage without FHA mortgage insurance if, at the time HUD offers it for sale, the mortgage secures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An unsubsidized project that receives any of the forms of assistance enumerated in paragraphs (4)(i) to (4)(iv) of the ``subsidized project'' definition in Sec. 290.5; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A subsidized project, as defined in Sec. 290.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This requirement shall continue in effect until the mortgage debt is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Covenant requirement for all delinquent mortgages sold without FHA mortgage insurance. This paragraph (d) applies to the sale of any mortgage that is delinquent at the time HUD offers it for sale without FHA mortgage insurance, without regard to the subsidy status of the project. The mortgage purchaser and its successors and assigns shall require the mortgagor to record a covenant running with the land as part of any loan restructuring or final compromise of the mortgage debt and shall include a covenant in any foreclosure deed executed in connection with the mortgage. The covenant shall set forth the nondiscrimination requirement in paragraph (a) of this section. The covenant shall continue in effect until a date that is the same as the maturity date of the mortgage sold by HUD.
