                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lender certifications. After borrower default and before filing a claim or assignment of the loan to the Agency, the lender must make every reasonable and prudent effort to resolve the default. The lender must provide the Agency with an accounting of all proposed and actual actions taken to cure the default. The lender must certify that all reasonable efforts to cure the default have been exhausted. Where the lender fails to comply with the terms of the loan guarantee agreement and the corresponding regulations and guidance with regard to liquidating the property, the Agency, at its option, may take possession of the security collateral and dispose of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due diligence by lender. For all loan servicing actions where a market, net recovery or liquidation value determination is required, guaranteed lenders shall perform due diligence in conjunction with the appraisal and submit it to the Agency for review. The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment published by the American Society of Testing and Materials is considered an acceptable format for due diligence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Environmental review. The Agency is required to complete an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G or a successor regulation, prior to disposition of inventory property, if title is held by the Agency, and prior to any authorization to the guaranteed lender to foreclose and dispose of property, and for any other servicing action requiring Agency approval or consent.</p>
