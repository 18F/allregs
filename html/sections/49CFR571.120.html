                            <p class="depth0">S1. Scope. This standard specifies tire and rim selection  requirements, rim marking requirements and motor home/recreation vehicle  trailer load carrying capacity information.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to provide safe  operational performance by ensuring that vehicles to which it applies  are equipped with tires of adequate size and load rating and with rims  of appropriate size and type designation, and by ensuring that consumers  are informed of motor home/recreation vehicle trailer load carrying  capacity.</p><p class="depth0">S3. Application. This standard applies to motor vehicles with a  gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 4,536 kilograms (10,000  pounds and motorcycles, to rims for use on those vehicles, and to non- pneumatic spare tire assemblies for use on those vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">S4. Definitions. All terms defined in the Act and the rules and  standards issued under its authority are used as defined therein.</p><p class="depth0">Rim base means the portion of a rim remaining after removal of all  split or continuous rim flanges, side rings, and locking rings that can  be detached from the rim.</p><p class="depth0">Rim size designation means rim diameter and width.</p><p class="depth0">Rim diameter means nominal diameter of the bead seat.</p><p class="depth0">Rim width means nominal distance between rim flanges.</p><p class="depth0">Rim type designation means the industry or manufacturer's  designation for a rim by style or code.</p><p class="depth0">Weather side means the surface area of the rim not covered by the  inflated tire.</p><p class="depth0">S5. Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Tire and rim selection.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1.1 Except as specified in S5.1.3, each vehicle equipped with  pneumatic tires for highway service shall be equipped with tires that  meet the requirements of Sec. 571.109, Sec. 571.119 or Sec. 571.139,  and rims that are listed by the manufacturer of the tires as suitable  for use with those tires, in accordance with S4.4 of Sec. 571.109 or  S5.1 of Sec. 571.119, as applicable, except that vehicles may be  equipped with a non-pneumatic spare tire assembly that meets the  requirements of Sec. 571.129, New non-pneumatic tires for passenger  cars, and S8 of this standard. Vehicles equipped with such an assembly  shall meet the requirements of S5.3.3, S7, and S9 of this standard.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1.2 Except in the case of a vehicle which has a speed attainable  in 3.2 kilometers of 80 kilometers per hour or less, the sum of the  maximum load ratings of the tires fitted to an axle shall   be not less than the gross axle weight rating (GAWR) of the axle system  as specified on the vehicle's certification label required by 49 CFR  part 567. Except in the case of a vehicle which has a speed attainable  in 2 miles of 50 mph or less, the sum of the maximum load ratings of the  tires fitted to an axle shall be not less than the gross axle weight  rating (GAWR) of the axle system as specified on the vehicle's  certification label required by 49 CFR part 567. If the certification  label shows more than one GAWR for the axle system, the sum shall be not  less than the GAWR corresponding to the size designation of the tires  fitted to the axle. If the size designation of the tires fitted to the  axle does not appear on the certification label, the sum shall be not  less than the lowest GAWR appearing on the label. When a passenger car  tire is installed on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or  trailer, the tire's load rating shall be reduced by dividing by 1.10  before calculating the sum (i.e., the sum of the load ratings of the  tires on each axle, when the tires' load carrying capacity at the  recommended tire cold inflation pressure is reduced by dividing by 1.10,  must be appropriate for the GAWR).</p><p class="depth0">S5.1.3 In place of tires that meet the requirements of Standard No.  119, a truck, bus, or trailer may at the request of a purchaser be  equipped at the place of manufacture of the vehicle with retreaded or  used tires owned or leased by the purchaser, if the sum of the maximum  load ratings meets the requirements of S5.1.2.
