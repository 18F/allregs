The assignment or other document  changing title must be recorded in the Office. The request to divide  must include the fee required by Sec.  2.6(a)(8) for each new  registration created by the division, and be signed by the owner of the  registration, someone with legal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a  corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or a  practitioner qualified to practice under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter, in  accordance with Sec.  2.193(e)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the International Bureau of the World Intellectual  Property Organization notifies the Office that an international  registration has been divided as the result of a change of ownership  with respect to some but not all of the goods and/or services, the  Office will construe the International Bureau's notice as a request to  divide. The Office will update Office records to reflect the change in  ownership, divide out the assigned goods and/or services from the  registered extension of protection (parent registration), and publish  notice of the parent registration in the Official Gazette.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Office will create a new registration number for the child  registration, and enter the information about the new registration in  its automated records.

It is not necessary  for the new owner to file a separate request to divide.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Office will not divide a registered extension of  protection unless the International Bureau notifies the Office that the  international registration has been divided.
