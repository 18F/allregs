                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Financial statements. The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this part. However, organization-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with Sec. 99.500(a) and prepare separate financial statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards. The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of Federal awards expended for each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> List individual Federal programs by Federal agency. For Federal programs included in a cluster of programs, list individual Federal programs within a cluster of programs. For R&D;, total Federal awards expended shall be shown either by individual award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity shall be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To the extent practical, pass-through entities should identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule, the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance, the amount of insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan guarantees outstanding at year end. While not required, it is preferable to present this information in the schedule.</p>
