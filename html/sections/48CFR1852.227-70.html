As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) or duly authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0">``Made'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When used in relation to any invention other than a plant variety, the conception or first actual reduction to practice of the invention; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When used in relation to a plant variety, that the Contractor has at least tentatively determined that the variety has been reproduced with recognized characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">``Nonprofit organization'' means a domestic university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)), or any domestic nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit organization statute.</p><p class="depth0">``Practical application'' means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p><p class="depth0">``Reportable item'' means any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation of the contractor, whether or not patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 of the United States Code, made in the performance of any work under any NASA contract or in the performance of any work that is reimbursable under any clause in any NASA contract providing for reimbursement of costs incurred before the effective date of the contract. Reportable items include, but are not limited to, new processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter, and improvements to, or new applications of, existing processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Reportable items also include new computer programs, and improvements to, or new applications of, existing computer programs, whether or not copyrightable or otherwise protectible under Title 17 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth0">``Small business firm'' means a domestic small business concern as defined at 15 U.S.C. 632 and implementing regulations of

the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. (For the purpose of this definition, the criteria and size standard adopted in the FAR Subpart 2.1 definitions for ``small business concern'' and for ``small business subcontractor'' will be used.)</p><p class="depth0">``Subject invention'' means any reportable item which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectible under Title 35 of the United States Code, or any novel variety of plant that is or may be protectible under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of principal rights--(1) Presumption of title. (i) Any reportable item that the Administrator considers to be a subject invention shall be presumed to have been made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135(b)) (hereinafter ``the Act''), and the above presumption shall be conclusive unless at the time of reporting the reportable item in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause the Contractor submits to the Contracting Officer a written statement, containing supporting details, demonstrating that the reportable item was not made in the manner specified in the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Presumption of title. (i) Any reportable item that the Administrator considers to be a subject invention shall be presumed to have been made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135(b)) (hereinafter ``the Act''), and the above presumption shall be conclusive unless at the time of reporting the reportable item in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause the Contractor submits to the Contracting Officer a written statement, containing supporting details, demonstrating that the reportable item was not made in the manner specified in the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any reportable item that the Administrator considers to be a subject invention shall be presumed to have been made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135(b)) (hereinafter ``the Act''), and the above presumption shall be conclusive unless at the time of reporting the reportable item in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause the Contractor submits to the Contracting Officer a written statement, containing supporting details, demonstrating that the reportable item was not made in the manner specified in the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Regardless of whether title to a given subject invention would otherwise be subject to an advance waiver or is the subject of a petition for waiver as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Contractor may nevertheless file the statement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause. The Administrator will review the information furnished by the Contractor in any such statement and any other available information relating to the circumstances surrounding the making of the subject invention and will notify the Contractor whether the Administrator has determined that the subject invention was made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property rights in subject inventions. Each subject invention for which the presumption of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause is conclusive or for which there has been a determination that it was made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act shall be the exclusive property of the United States as represented by NASA unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver of rights. (i) Section 20135(g) of the Act provides for the promulgation of regulations by which the Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or that may be made under conditions specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act. The promulgated NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, provide procedures for the Contractor to submit petitions (requests) for waiver of rights and guidance for NASA in acting on petitions for such waiver of rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 20135(g) of the Act provides for the promulgation of regulations by which the Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or that may be made under conditions specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act. The promulgated NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, provide procedures for the Contractor to submit petitions (requests) for waiver of rights and guidance for NASA in acting on petitions for such waiver of rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As provided in 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, the Contractor may petition, either prior to execution of the contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract, for advance waiver of rights to any invention or class of inventions that may be made under a contract. If such a petition is not submitted, or if after submission it is denied, the Contractor (or an employee inventor of the Contractor) may petition for waiver of rights to an identified subject invention within eight months of first disclosure of invention in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, or within such longer period as may be authorized in accordance with 14 CFR 1245.105.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum rights reserved by the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With respect to each subject invention for which a waiver of rights has been granted, the Government reserves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government in accordance with any treaty or agreement with the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such other rights as stated in 14 CFR 1245.107.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be considered to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minimum rights to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor is hereby granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention in which the Government has title and in any resulting patent, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37 CFR part 404, Licensing of Government Owned Inventions. The Contractor's license

will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the Administrator to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Before revoking or modifying the Contractor's license, the Contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the Administrator for good cause shown) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal to the Administrator any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Contractor's obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that reportable items are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology--Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause within six months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of the reportable items, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall disclose in writing each reportable item to the Contracting Officer within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology--Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause or within six months after the Contractor becomes aware that a reportable item has been made, whichever is earlier, but in any event for subject inventions before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to the agency shall identify the inventor(s) or innovator(s) and this contract under which the reportable item was made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the reportable item. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, sale or offer for sale, or public use of any subject invention and whether a manuscript describing such invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing a subject invention for publication or of any sale, offer for sale, or public use planned by the Contractor for such invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor may use whatever format is convenient to disclose reportable items required in subparagraph (e)(2). NASA prefers that the Contractor use either the electronic or paper version of NASA Form 1679, Disclosure of Invention and New Technology (including computer software) to disclose reportable items. Both the electronic and paper versions of NASA Form 1679 may be accessed at the electronic New Technology Reporting Web site http://invention.nasa.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interim new technology summary reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing reportable items during that period, and certifying that all reportable items have been disclosed (or that there are no such inventions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A final new technology summary report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all reportable items or certifying that there were no such reportable items, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Contractor agrees, upon written request of the Contracting Officer, to furnish additional technical and other information available to the Contractor as is necessary for the preparation of a patent application on a subject invention and for the prosecution of the patent application, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Contractor agrees, subject to paragraph 27.302(j) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examination of records relating to inventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the

right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any such inventions are subject inventions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor has established and maintained the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclose any reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deliver acceptable interim new technology summary reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this clause or a final new technology summary report pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) (ii) of this clause; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of reportable items required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, and an acceptable final new technology summary report pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Include the clause at FAR 52.227-11, as modified by 1852.227-11, (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Modify the applicable clause in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor, the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of subcontracts at any tier, the agency, subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and NASA with respect to those matters covered by this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause in the subcontract, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Contractor in the clause of paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause, whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract,

Unless provided otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Administrator upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)
