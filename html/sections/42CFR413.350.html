                                Sec. 413.350  Periodic interim payments for skilled nursing   prospective payment system for Part A services.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section, SNFs receiving payment under the PPS for Part A  services do not receive interim payments during the cost reporting year,  and receive payment only following submission of a bill. Paragraph (d)  of this section provides for accelerated payments in certain  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periodic interim payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An SNF receiving payment under  the prospective payment system may receive periodic interim payments  (PIP) for Part A SNF services under the PIP method subject to the  provisions of Sec. 413.64(h). To be approved for PIP, the SNF must meet  the qualifying requirements in Sec. 413.64(h)(3). Moreover, as provided  in Sec. 413.64(h)(5), contractor approval is conditioned upon the  contractor's best judgment as to whether payment can be made under the  PIP method without undue risk of its resulting in an overpayment to the  provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frequency of payment. The contractor estimates an SNF's  prospective payments net of estimated beneficiary coinsurance and makes  biweekly payments equal to \1/26\ of the total estimated amount of  payment for the year. If an SNF has payment experience under the  prospective payment system, the contractor estimates PIP based on that  payment experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by  substantiated information for the current year. Each payment is made 2  weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as described in  Sec. 413.64(h)(6). The interim payments are reviewed at least twice  during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may  be necessary if an SNF receives interim payments for less than a full  reporting period. These payments are subject to final settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Termination of PIP--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Request by the SNF. An SNF receiving PIP  may convert to receiving prospective payments on a non-PIP basis at any  time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removal by the contractor. An contractor terminates PIP if the  SNF no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 413.64(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interim payments for Medicare bad debts and for Part A costs not  paid under the prospective payment system. For Medicare bad debts and  for costs of an approved education program and other costs paid outside  the prospective payment system, the contractor determines the interim  payments by estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the  previous year's experience, adjusted for projected   changes supported by substantiated information for the current year, and  makes biweekly payments equal to \1/26\ of the total estimated amount.  Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of  service as described in Sec. 413.64(h)(6). The interim payments are  reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if  necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if an SNF receives interim  payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are  subject to final cost settlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accelerated payments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Upon request, an  accelerated payment may be made to an SNF that is receiving payment  under the prospective payment system and is not receiving PIP under  paragraph (b) of this section if the SNF is experiencing financial  difficulties because of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is a delay by the contractor in making payment to the SNF.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in  the SNF's preparation and submittal of bills to the contractor beyond  its normal billing cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approval of payment. An SNF's request for an accelerated payment  must be approved by the contractor and CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of payment. The amount of the accelerated payment is  computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid  covered services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recovery of payment. Recovery of the accelerated payment is made  by recoupment as SNF bills are processed or by direct payment by the  SNF.  [64 FR 41682, July 30, 1999]</p>
