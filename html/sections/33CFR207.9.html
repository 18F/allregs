                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition and authority of superintendent. The term superintendent as used in the regulations in this section shall mean himself and/or his personnel then on duty at the dam. The positioning and movements of all watercraft of every description while in the locks or within 100 yards of the locks or dam shall be subject to the direction of the superintendent whose orders must be obeyed. This order does not relieve the master of the responsibility for the safety of his vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of locks. There are three (3) locks to be used for the passage of vessels; one large lock 325 feet long, 45 feet wide, shall be used for vessels with draft up to seventeen (17) feet; two small locks each 120 feet long and 22 feet wide shall be used for boats up to six (6) feet draft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maximum draft. Vessels drawing within six (6) inches of depth over the sills shall not be permitted lockage except under special permission of the superintendent. Every vessel using the locks and drawing more than ten (10) feet shall be accurately and distinctly marked at bow and stern showing the exact draft of water at such portions of the vessel. Gages set into the walls or the locks, both upstream and downstream of each gate, indicate the depth in feet of water over the sill of the gate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vessels denied lockage. The superintendent may deny passage through the locks to any craft with sharp, rough projecting corners, overhanging equipment or cargo, or any craft or two that is in sinking condition or in any way unseaworthy or insufficiently manned and equipped, or any craft failing to comply with the regulations in this section or with any orders given in pursuance thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protection of lock gates. (1) In no case shall boats be permitted to enter or leave any of the locks until directed to do so by the superintendent. Boats shall not be permitted to enter or start to leave until the lock gates are at rest within the gate recesses. All persons, whether in charge of vessels or not, are prohibited from willfully or carelessly damaging the locks or any of the appurtenances or the grounds adjacent thereto, and from throwing or allowing any material of any kind to fall from the barge, scow or other vessel into the locks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In no case shall boats be permitted to enter or leave any of the locks until directed to do so by the superintendent. Boats shall not be permitted to enter or start to leave until the lock gates are at rest within the gate recesses. All persons, whether in charge of vessels or not, are prohibited from willfully or carelessly damaging the locks or any of the appurtenances or the grounds adjacent thereto, and from throwing or allowing any material of any kind to fall from the barge, scow or other vessel into the locks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No person shall permit or suffer any vessel, scow, raft, or float to come in contract with any gate or any of the locks of the Amelia Earhart Dam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Damage to walls. The sides of all craft passing through the locks must be free from projection of any kind which might injure the lock walls. All craft must be provided with suitable fenders. One or more men as the superintendent may direct shall be kept at the head of every tow until it has cleared the lock and guide walls, and shall protect the walls by use of the fenders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unnecessary delay at locks. No person shall cause or permit any craft of which he is in charge to remain in the locks or their approaches for a longer period of time than is necessary for the passage of the locks unless he is especially permitted to do so by the superintendent, and if such craft is, in the opinion of such superintendent, in a position to obstruct navigation, it shall be removed at once as requested or directed by the superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Procedure at locks. The locks shall be operated promptly for the passage of all craft upon signal, excepting only in such cases as are specifically provided for in the regulations in this section. All registered merchant vessels shall pass through the locks in the order directed by the superintendent. Other craft shall be allowed to pass through the locks at the discretion of the superintendent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Navigation of the locks. (1) All barges navigating the locks whether approaching or leaving the locks are required to be assisted by one or more tugs of sufficient power to insure full control at all times. All craft approaching the locks while any other vessel going in the opposite direction is in or about to enter shall be stopped where they will not obstruct the free passage of such other vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All barges navigating the locks whether approaching or leaving the locks are required to be assisted by one or more tugs of sufficient power to insure full control at all times. All craft approaching the locks while any other vessel going in the opposite direction is in or about to enter shall be stopped where they will not obstruct the free passage of such other vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All vessels over 100 gross tons including those which are accompanied by towboats must attach not less than two good and sufficient lines, cables, or hawsers to the bollards or other fixtures provided for the purpose to check the speed of the vessel and to stop it as soon as it has gone far enough to permit the lock gate behind it to be closed. Each line, cable, or hawser shall be attended on board while passing into the lock by one or more of the vessel's crew. Where vessels are so long that in order to get them wholly within the locks it is necessary to go within 100 feet of the lock gate ahead, the speed of the vessel must be slow and the vessel must be fully under control at all times by the lines, cables or hawsers. All towboats and vessels less than 100 gross tons may enter the locks without having lines out subject to the discretion of the superintendent. The master or person in charge of a vessel shall arrange to have any line, cable, or hawser handed or thrown from the lock walls by the superintendent, or his assistants, made fast on the vessel as requested or directed, so that in cases of emergency such line, cable, or hawser may also be used to check the speed of and stop the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operators of vessels less than 200 gross tons may use the floating moorings in the large lock to fasten lines or hawsers, but they shall not be used to check the way on any vessel greater than 30 gross tons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vessels less than 30 gross tons may fasten lines to the floating moorings in the large or small locks. All persons shall keep off the floating moorings at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No line shall be attached to anything on or a part of the dam except the fixtures provided for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Equipment of each craft shall include a sufficient bow line and stern line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Mooring. When a craft is in position in the lock, it shall be securely fastened in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent to prevent the craft moving about while the lock is being filled or emptied, and the lines, cables, or hawsers used for this purpose shall be attended as far as is necessary or required while the filling or empting is in progress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Signals. (1) All craft desiring lockage shall, on approaching the locks, signal by two long and two short blasts of a whistle or other sound device. Two long blasts from the lock in reply will indicate a delayed opening and direct the craft not to enter the lock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All craft desiring lockage shall, on approaching the locks, signal by two long and two short blasts of a whistle or other sound device. Two long blasts from the lock in reply will indicate a delayed opening and direct the craft not to enter the lock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lights are located at each end of each lock and will normally show red. No vessel shall come within 100 feet of the outside of any gate when the signal is red except when so directed by the superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fireboats and craft owned by the U.S. Government shall be given prompt and preferential lockage when they sound four long blasts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No vessel shall move into or out of any lock until the controlling signal is green. A green light in addition to audio loud speakers, operated by the superintendent or his assistants, will direct craft through the locks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It shall be the duty of every master or person in charge of any vessel to ascertain by personal observation that the lock gate is fully open before proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Operating machinery. Lock employees only shall be permitted to operate the lock gates, signals or other appliances. No person shall deface or injure any part of the Amelia Earhart Dam, or any pier, wall or other structure or any mechanism connected

therewith; nor shall any person, without the consent of the superintendent, make fast to the dam, guard, guide wall, pier, or any appurtenance thereof any vessel, scow, raft, or float.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Vessel to carry regulations. A copy of the regulations in this section shall be kept at all times on board each vessel regularly engaged in navigating the locks. Copies may be obtained without charge from the superintendent; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, M.D.C. Parks Division, Boston, Mass.; New England Division, Corps of Engineers, Division Engineer, Waltham, Mass.
