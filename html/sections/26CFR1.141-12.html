                                Sec. 1.141-12  Remedial actions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (1) through (5) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable expectations test met. The issuer reasonably expected  on the issue date that the issue would meet neither the private business  tests nor the private loan financing test for the entire term of the  bonds. For this purpose, if the issuer reasonably expected on the issue  date to take a deliberate action prior to the final maturity date of the  issue that would cause either the private business tests or the private  loan financing test to be met, the term of the bonds for this purpose  may be determined by taking into account a redemption provision if the  provisions of Sec. 1.141-2(d)(2)(ii) (A) through (C) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maturity not unreasonably long. The term of the issue must not  be longer than is reasonably necessary for the governmental purposes of  the issue (within the meaning of Sec. 1.148-1(c)(4)). Thus, this  requirement is met if the weighted average maturity of the bonds of the  issue is not greater than 120 percent of the average reasonably expected  economic life of the property   financed with the proceeds of the issue as of the issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fair market value consideration. Except as provided in paragraph  (f) of this section, the terms of any arrangement that results in  satisfaction of either the private business tests or the private loan  financing test are bona fide and arm's-length, and the new user pays  fair market value for the use of the financed property. Thus, for  example, fair market value may be determined in a manner that takes into  account restrictions on the use of the financed property that serve a  bona fide governmental purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disposition proceeds treated as gross proceeds for arbitrage  purposes. The issuer must treat any disposition proceeds as gross  proceeds for purposes of section 148. For purposes of eligibility for  temporary periods under section 148(c) and exemptions from the  requirement of section 148(f) the issuer may treat the date of receipt  of the disposition proceeds as the issue date of the bonds and disregard  the receipt of disposition proceeds for exemptions based on expenditure  of proceeds under Sec. 1.148-7 that were met before the receipt of the  disposition proceeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proceeds expended on a governmental purpose. Except for a  remedial action under paragraph (d) of this section, the proceeds of the  issue that are affected by the deliberate action must have been expended  on a governmental purpose before the date of the deliberate action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of a remedial action--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The effect of a  remedial action is to cure use of proceeds that causes the private  business use test or the private loan financing test to be met. A  remedial action does not affect application of the private security or  payment test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect on bonds that have been advance refunded. If proceeds of  an issue were used to advance refund another bond, a remedial action  taken with respect to the refunding bond proportionately reduces the  amount of proceeds of the advance refunded bond that is taken into  account under the private business use test or the private loan  financing test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition proceeds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Disposition proceeds are  any amounts (including property, such as an agreement to provide  services) derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition  (disposition) of property (other than investments) financed with the  proceeds of an issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocating disposition proceeds to an issue. In general, if the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, after the date of  the disposition, the proceeds of the issue allocable to the transferred  property are treated as financing the disposition proceeds rather than  the transferred property. If a disposition is made pursuant to an  installment sale, the proceeds of the issue continue to be allocated to  the transferred property. If an issue does not meet the requirements for  remedial action in paragraph (a) of this section or the issuer does not  take an appropriate remedial action, the proceeds of the issue are  allocable to either the transferred property or the disposition  proceeds, whichever allocation produces the greater amount of private  business use and private security or payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>,  principal amount has the same meaning as in Sec. 1.148-9(b)(2) and  outstanding bonds do not include advance refunded bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Redemption or defeasance of nonqualified bonds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The requirements of this paragraph (d) are met if all of the  nonqualified bonds of the issue are redeemed. Proceeds of tax-exempt  bonds must not be used for this purpose, unless the tax-exempt bonds are  qualified bonds, taking into account the purchaser's use of the  facility. If the bonds are not redeemed   within 90 days of the date of the deliberate action, a defeasance escrow  must be established for those bonds within 90 days of the deliberate  action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for dispositions for cash. If the consideration for  the disposition of financed property is exclusively cash, the  requirements of this paragraph (d) are met if the disposition proceeds  are used to redeem a pro rata portion of the nonqualified bonds at the  earliest call date after the deliberate action. If the bonds are not  redeemed within 90 days of the date of the deliberate action, the  disposition proceeds must be used to establish a defeasance escrow for  those bonds within 90 days of the deliberate action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice of defeasance. The issuer must provide written notice to  the Commissioner of the establishment of the defeasance escrow within 90  days of the date the defeasance escrow is established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special limitation. The establishment of a defeasance escrow  does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d) if the period  between the issue date and the first call date of the bonds is more than  10\1/2\ years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Defeasance escrow defined. A defeasance escrow is an irrevocable  escrow established to redeem bonds on their earliest call date in an  amount that, together with investment earnings, is sufficient to pay all  the principal of, and interest and call premium on, bonds from the date  the escrow is established to the earliest call date. The escrow may not  be invested in higher yielding investments or in any investment under  which the obligor is a user of the proceeds of the bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative use of disposition proceeds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  requirements of this paragraph (e) are met if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The deliberate action is a disposition for which the  consideration is exclusively cash;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer reasonably expects to expend the disposition  proceeds within two years of the date of the deliberate action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The disposition proceeds are treated as proceeds for purposes  of section 141 and are used in a manner that does not cause the issue to  meet either the private business tests or the private loan financing  test, and the issuer does not take any action subsequent to the date of  the deliberate action to cause either of these tests to be met; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the issuer does not use all of the disposition proceeds for  an alternative use described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section,  the issuer uses those remaining disposition proceeds for a remedial  action that meets paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for use by 501(c)(3) organizations. If the  disposition proceeds are to be used by a 501(c)(3) organization, the  nonqualified bonds must in addition be treated as reissued for purposes  of sections 141, 145, 147, 149, and 150 and, under this treatment,  satisfy all of the applicable requirements for qualified 501(c)(3)  bonds. Thus, beginning on the date of the deliberate action,  nonqualified bonds that satisfy these requirements must be treated as  qualified 501(c)(3) bonds for all purposes, including sections 145(b)  and 150(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> are met if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facility with respect to which the deliberate action occurs  is used in an alternative manner (for example, used for a qualifying  purpose by a nongovernmental person or used by a 501(c)(3) organization  rather than a governmental person);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nonqualified bonds are treated as reissued, as of the date  of the deliberate action, for purposes of sections 55 through 59 and  141, 142, 144, 145, 146, 147, 149 and 150, and under this treatment, the  nonqualified bonds satisfy all the applicable requirements for qualified  bonds throughout the remaining term of the nonqualified bonds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deliberate action does not involve a disposition to a  purchaser that finances the acquisition with proceeds of another issue  of tax-exempt bonds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any disposition proceeds other than those arising from an  agreement to provide services (including disposition proceeds from an  installment sale) resulting from the deliberate action are used to pay  the debt service on the bonds on the next available payment date or,  within 90 days of receipt, are   deposited into an escrow that is restricted to the yield on the bonds to  pay the debt service on the bonds on the next available payment date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rules for deemed reissuance. For purposes of determining whether  bonds that are treated as reissued under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this  section are qualified bonds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of the Code and regulations thereunder in effect  as of the date of the deliberate action apply; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, section 147(d)  (relating to the acquisition of existing property) does not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Authority of Commissioner to provide for additional remedial  actions. The Commissioner may, by publication in the Federal Register or  the Internal Revenue Bulletin, provide additional remedial actions,  including making a remedial payment to the United States, under which a  subsequent action will not be treated as a deliberate action for  purposes of Sec. 1.141-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Effect of remedial action on continuing compliance. Solely for  purposes of determining whether deliberate actions that are taken after  a remedial action cause an issue to meet the private business tests or  the private loan financing test--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a remedial action is taken under paragraph (d), (e), or (f)  of this section, the private business use or private loans resulting  from the deliberate action are not taken into account for purposes of  determining whether the bonds are private activity bonds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After a remedial action is taken, the amount of disposition  proceeds is treated as equal to the proceeds of the issue that had been  allocable to the transferred property immediately prior to the  disposition. See paragraph (k) of this section, Example 5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Nonqualified bonds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount of nonqualified bonds. The  percentage of outstanding bonds that are nonqualified bonds equals the  highest percentage of private business use in any 1-year period  commencing with the deliberate action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of nonqualified bonds. Allocations to nonqualified  bonds must be made on a pro rata basis, except that, for purposes of  paragraph (d) of this section (relating to redemption or defeasance), an  issuer may treat bonds with longer maturities (determined on a bond-by- bond basis) as the nonqualified bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 Disposition proceeds less than outstanding bonds used to  retire bonds. On June 1, 1997, City C issues 30-year bonds with an issue  price of $10 million to finance the construction of a hospital building.  The bonds have a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120  percent of the reasonably expected economic life of the building. On the  issue date, C reasonably expects that it will be the only user of the  building for the entire term of the bonds. Six years after the issue  date, C sells the building to Corporation P for $5 million. The sale  price is the fair market value of the building, as verified by an  independent appraiser. C uses all of the $5 million disposition proceeds  to immediately retire a pro rata portion of the bonds. The sale does not  cause the bonds to be private activity bonds because C has taken a  remedial action described in paragraph (d) of this section so that P is  not treated as a private business user of bond proceeds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Lease to nongovernmental person. The facts are the same  as in Example 1, except that instead of selling the building, C, 6 years  after the issue date, leases the building to P for 7 years and uses  other funds to redeem all of the $10 million outstanding bonds within 90  days of the deliberate act. The bonds are not treated as private  activity bonds because C has taken the remedial action described in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Sale for less than fair market value. The facts are the  same as in Example 1, except that the fair market value of the building  at the time of the sale to P is $6 million. Because the transfer was for  less than fair market value, the bonds are ineligible for the remedial  actions under this section. The bonds are private activity bonds because  P is treated as a user of all of the proceeds and P makes a payment ($6  million) for this use that is greater than 10 percent of the debt  service on the bonds, on a present value basis.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Fair market value determined taking into account  governmental restrictions. The facts are the same as in Example 1,  except that the building was used by C only for hospital purposes and C  determines to sell the building subject to a restriction that it be used  only for hospital purposes. After conducting a public bidding procedure  as required by state law, the best price that C is able to obtain for  the building subject to this   restriction is $4.5 million from P. C uses all of the $4.5 million  disposition proceeds to immediately retire a pro rata portion of the  bonds. The sale does not cause the bonds to be private activity bonds  because C has taken a remedial action described in paragraph (d) of this  section so that P is not treated as a private business user of bond  proceeds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Alternative use of disposition proceeds. The facts are  the same as in Example 1, except that C reasonably expects on the date  of the deliberate action to use the $5 million disposition proceeds for  another governmental purpose (construction of governmentally owned  roads) within two years of receipt, rather than using the $5 million to  redeem outstanding bonds. C treats these disposition proceeds as gross  proceeds for purposes of section 148. The bonds are not private activity  bonds because C has taken a remedial action described in paragraph (e)  of this section. After the date of the deliberate action, the proceeds  of all of the outstanding bonds are treated as used for the construction  of the roads, even though only $5 million of disposition proceeds was  actually used for the roads.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Alternative use of financed property. The facts are the  same as in Example 1, except that C determines to lease the hospital  building to Q, an organization described in section 501(c)(3), for a  term of 10 years rather than to sell the building to P. In order to  induce Q to provide hospital services, C agrees to lease payments that  are less than fair market value. Before entering into the lease, an  applicable elected representative of C approves the lease after a  noticed public hearing. As of the date of the deliberate action, the  issue meets all the requirements for qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, treating  the bonds as reissued on that date. For example, the issue meets the two  percent restriction on use of proceeds of finance issuance costs of  section 147(g) because the issue pays no costs of issuance from  disposition proceeds in connection with the deemed reissuance. C and Q  treat the bonds as qualified 501(c)(3) bonds for all purposes commencing  with the date of the deliberate action. The bonds are treated as  qualified 501(c)(3) bonds commencing with the date of the deliberate  action.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Deliberate action before proceeds are expended on a  governmental purpose. County J issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million  that can be used only to finance a correctional facility. On the issue  date of the bonds, J reasonably expects that it will be the sole user of  the bonds for the useful life of the facility. The bonds have a weighted  average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the reasonably  expected economic life of the facility. After the issue date of the  bonds, but before the facility is placed in service, J enters into a  contract with the federal government pursuant to which the federal  government will make a fair market value, lump sum payment equal to 25  percent of the cost of the facility. In exchange for this payment, J  provides the federal government with priority rights to use of 25  percent of the facility. J uses the payment received from the federal  government to defease the nonqualified bonds. The agreement does not  cause the bonds to be private activity bonds because J has taken a  remedial action described in paragraph (d) of this section. See  paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Compliance after remedial action. In 1997, City G issues  bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a courthouse. The bonds  have a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the  reasonably expected economic life of the courthouse. G uses $1 million  of the proceeds for a private business use and more than 10 percent of  the debt service on the issue is secured by private security or  payments. G later sells one-half of the courthouse property to a  nongovernmental person for cash. G immediately redeems 60 percent of the  outstanding bonds. This percentage of outstanding bonds is based on the  highest private business use of the courthouse in any 1-year period  commencing with the deliberate action. For purposes of subsequently  applying section 141 to the issue, G may continue to use all of the  proceeds of the outstanding bonds in the same manner (that is, for both  the courthouse and the existing private business use) without causing  the issue to meet the private business use test. The issue, however,  continues to meet the private security or payment test. The result would  be the same if D, instead of redeeming the bonds, established a  defeasance escrow for those bonds, provided that the requirement of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section was met.
