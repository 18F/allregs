                                Sec. 120.1511  Certification and other reporting and notification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification. An SBLC seeking Other Regulated SBLC status must  certify to SBA in writing that its lending activities are subject to  regulation by a Federal Financial Institution Regulator or state banking  regulator. This certification must be executed by the chair of the board  of directors of the SBLC and submitted to SBA either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 60 calendar days of the effective date of this section or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the SBLC becomes subject to regulation by a Federal Financial  Institution Regulator or state banking regulator after the effective  date of this section for any reason (e.g. license transfers), within 60  days of the date that the SBLC becomes directly examined and directly  regulated by such regulator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of Certification: This certification must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identity of the Federal Financial Institution Regulator or  state banking regulator that regulates the lending activities of the  SBLC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the Federal Financial Institution Regulator or  state banking regulator identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section  regularly conducts safety and soundness examinations on the SBLC itself  and not only on the SBLC's parent company or affiliate, if any; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of the most recent safety and soundness examination  conducted on the SBLC by the Federal Financial Institution Regulator or  state banking regulator. To qualify as an Other Regulated SBLC, the SBLC  must have received this examination within the past 3 years of the date  of certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of examination. An Other Regulated SBLC must notify  SBA in writing each time a Federal Financial Institution Regulator or  state banking regulator conducts a safety and soundness examination, and  this notification must be submitted to SBA within 30 calendar days of  the SBLC receiving the results of the examination. To retain its status  as an Other Regulated SBLC, the Other Regulated SBLC must receive such  examination, and provide the written notification to SBA, at least once  every two years following initial certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Report. An Other Regulated SBLC must report in writing to SBA on  its interactions with other Federal Financial Institution Regulators or  state banking regulator (e.g., the results of the safety and soundness  examinations and any order issued against the Other Regulated SBLC), to  the extent allowed by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification of change in status. If, for any reason, an Other  Regulated SBLC becomes no longer subject to regulation by a Federal  Financial Institution Regulator or state banking regulator, the Other  Regulated SBLC must immediately notify SBA in writing, and the exemption  provided in Sec. 120.1510 will immediately no longer apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Extension of timeframes. SBA may in its discretion extend any  timeframe imposed on the SBLC under this section if the SBLC can show  good cause for any delay in meeting the time requirement. The SBLC may  appeal this decision to the AA/CA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to satisfy requirements. In the event that an SBLC fails  to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of  this section, then the exemption provided in Sec. 120.1510 will not  apply to the SBLC.
