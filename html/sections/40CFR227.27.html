                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The limiting permissible concentration of the liquid phase of a material is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That concentration of a constituent which, after allowance for initial mixing as provided in Sec. 227.29, does not exceed applicable marine water quality criteria; or, when there are no applicable marine water quality criteria,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That concentration of waste or dredged material in the receiving water which, after allowance for initial mixing, as specified in Sec. 227.29, will not exceed a toxicity threshold defined as 0.01 of a concentration shown to be acutely toxic to appropriate sensitive marine organisms in a bioassay carried out in accordance with approved EPA procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When there is reasonable scientific evidence on a specific waste material to justify the use of an application factor other than 0.01 as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, such alternative application factor shall be used in calculating the LPC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The limiting permissible concentration of the suspended particulate and solid phases of a material means that concentration which will not cause unreasonable acute or chronic toxicity or other sublethal adverse effects based on bioassay results using appropriate sensitive marine organisms in the case of the suspended particulate phase, or appropriate sensitive benthic marine organisms in the case of the solid phase; and which will not cause accumulation of toxic materials in the human food chain. Suspended particulate phase bioaccumulation testing is not required. These bioassays are to be conducted in accordance with procedures approved by EPA, or, in the case of dredged material, approved by EPA and the Corps of Engineers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appropriate sensitive marine organisms means at least one species each representative of phytoplankton or zooplankton, crustacean or mollusk, and fish species chosen from among the most sensitive species documented in the scientific literature or accepted by EPA as being reliable test organisms to determine the anticipated impact of the wastes on the ecosystem at the disposal site. Bioassays, except on phytoplankton or zooplankton, shall be run for a minimum of 96 hours under temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen conditions representing the extremes of environmental stress at the disposal site. Bioassays on phytoplankton or zooplankton may be run for shorter periods of time as appropriate for the organisms tested at the discretion of EPA, or EPA and the Corps of Engineers, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appropriate sensitive benthic marine organisms means two or more species that together represent filter-feeding, deposit-feeding, and burrowing characteristics. These organisms shall be chosen from among the species that are most sensitive for each type they represent, and that are documented in the scientific literature and accepted by EPA as being reliable test organisms to

determine the anticipated impact on the site.
