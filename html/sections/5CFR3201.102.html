                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Credit subject to this section. The prohibition,  disqualification, and retention provisions of this section apply to a  current or contingent financial obligation of the employee. For purposes  of this section, a current or contingent financial obligation of an  employee's spouse or minor child is considered to be an obligation of  the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Disqualification applicable to FDIC employees generally. Except  as provided in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No FDIC employee may participate in an examination, audit,  visitation, review, or investigation, or any other particular matter  involving an FDIC-insured institution, subsidiary or other person with  whom the employee has an outstanding extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For employees, other than covered employees as defined in  Sec. 3201.101(d)(3), disqualification is not required if the credit was  extended through the use of a credit card on the same terms and  conditions as are offered to the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office  of Thrift Supervision shall be disqualified from any matter pending  before the FDIC Board of Directors to the same extent as an FDIC  employee subject to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Prohibited borrowing by covered employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prohibition on  covered employee borrowing. Except as provided below, no covered  employee shall, directly or indirectly, accept or become obligated on a  loan or extension of credit, whether current or contingent, from any  FDIC-insured State nonmember bank or its subsidiary or from an officer,  director, or employee, of any FDIC-insured State nonmember bank or its  subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions: (i) Credit cards. A covered employee (or spouse or  minor child of a covered employee) may obtain and hold a credit card  account established under an open end consumer credit plan and issued by  an FDIC-insured State nonmember bank or its subsidiary subject to the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The cardholder must satisfy all financial requirements for the  credit   card account that are generally applicable to all applicants for the  same type of credit card account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms and conditions applicable with respect to the account  and any credit extended to the cardholder under the account are no more  favorable generally to the cardholder than the terms and conditions that  are generally applicable to credit card accounts offered by the same  bank (or the same subsidiary) to other cardholders in comparable  circumstances under open end consumer credit plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loans secured primarily by principal residence. A covered  employee (or a spouse or minor child of a covered employee) may obtain  and hold a loan from an FDIC-insured State nonmember bank or its  subsidiary subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The loan is secured by residential real property that is the  principal residence of the borrower. The borrower may retain the loan if  the residential real property ceases to be the principal residence.  However, any subsequent renewal or renegotiation of the original terms  of such a loan must meet the requirements of this paragraph;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The borrower may not apply for the loan while the covered  employee participates in any examination, the review of any application,  or any other supervisory or regulatory or other particular matter  directly affecting the State nonmember bank or its subsidiaries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The borrower must satisfy all financial requirements for the  loan that are generally applicable to all applicants for the same type  of residential real property loan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The terms and conditions applicable with respect to the loan and  any credit extended to the borrower under the loan are no more favorable  generally to the borrower than the terms and conditions that are  generally applicable to residential real property loans offered by the  same State nonmember bank or the same subsidiary to other borrowers in  comparable circumstances for residential real property loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disqualification of covered employees. A covered employee shall  not participate in an examination, audit, visitation, review, or  investigation, or other particular matter involving an FDIC-insured  depository institution or other person with whom the covered employee  has an outstanding extension of credit, or with whom the covered  employee is negotiating an extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment dispute, delinquency, or other significant matter  concerning credit card debt. Disqualification is not required if the  credit is extended through the use of a credit card. However,  disqualification will be required when a covered employee is delinquent  on payments, has a billing dispute, is negotiating with the institution,  or has any other significant issue regarding the credit card debt. The  covered employee must notify his or her supervisor and deputy ethics  counselor of a dispute in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Primary residence mortgage loan. Disqualification will be  required if the covered employee is negotiating for, has an application  pending for, or enters into a primary residence mortgage loan. This  disqualification will cease when the loan is sold, even if the loan  originator retains the loan servicing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other limitations on covered employees. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A covered employee  shall not accept or become obligated on an otherwise permissible loan if  the disqualification arising from the credit relationship would  materially impair the covered employee's ability to participate in  matters that are central to the performance of the covered employee's  official duties, or if the covered employee has been advised of an  assignment to handle a matter involving that institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Covered employees to whom the prohibitions in this section  apply may not apply for a credit card or primary residence mortgage loan  from a State nonmember bank or subsidiary that the covered employee is  assigned to examine or participate in a matter involving that  institution, or if such an assignment is imminent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pre-existing credit. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This section does not prohibit a  covered employee, or any FDIC employee who becomes a covered employee as  a result of any reassignment of duties or position, from retaining a  loan or extension of credit from a State nonmember bank or its  subsidiary on its original terms if the   loan or extension of credit was incurred prior to employment by the FDIC  or as a result of the sale or transfer of a loan or credit to a State  nonmember bank or its subsidiary or the conversion or merger of the  lender into a State nonmember bank or its subsidiary. Any renewal or  renegotiation of a pre-existing loan or extension of credit will be  treated as a new loan or extension of credit subject to the prohibitions  at paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A covered employee may request that an exception be made to the  prohibitions to permit renegotiation of a pre-existing loan or extension  of credit. If a covered employee would experience financial or other  hardship unless allowed to renegotiate a pre-existing loan or extension  of credit, the covered employee may submit a written request to his or  her supervisor and to the Ethics Counselor, describing the reasons for  renegotiation, the original and the proposed terms and conditions,  including whether the financial institution makes such terms generally  available to the public, and any attempts by the covered employee to  move the loan to a non-prohibited source. After consideration of the  request, the covered employee's supervisor and the Ethics Counselor  jointly may grant the waiver upon a finding that renegotiation is not  prohibited by law, and that the waiver does not result in a loss of  impartiality or objectivity or in misuse of the employee's position. To  be effective, the waiver must be in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Two-year prohibition on acceptance of credit from an FDIC- insured depository institution. An FDIC employee shall not, directly or  indirectly, accept or become obligated on any extension of credit from  an FDIC-insured depository institution or its subsidiary for a period of  two years from the date of the employee's last personal and substantial  participation in an audit, resolution, liquidation, assistance  transactions, supervisory proceeding, or internal agency deliberation  affecting that particular institution, its predecessor or successor, or  any subsidiary of such institution. This prohibition does not apply to  credit obtained through the use of a credit card or a residential real  property loan secured by the principal residence of the employee,  subject to the same conditions, limitations, disqualification, and  waiver procedures applicable to covered employees under paragraphs (c)  and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Waiver. The Ethics Counselor may grant a written waiver from any  provision of this section based on a determination made with the advice  and legal clearance of the Legal Division that the waiver is not  inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by  law, and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the  prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of  position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in  the impartiality and objectivity with which the FDIC's programs are  administered. A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate  conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.  [72 FR 19378, Apr. 18, 2007]</p>
