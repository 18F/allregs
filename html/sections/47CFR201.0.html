                            <p class="depth0">National policy with respect to the conservation, allocation and use  of the Nation's telecommunications resources during crises and  emergencies is set forth in Executive Order 12472. The following parts  of this chapter address specific responsibilities with respect to  management of telecommunications resources and related procedures which  bear upon provision, restoration and continuity of telecommunications  services during crises and emergencies. In doing so, the chapter  encompasses both national security and emergency preparedness  activities, consistent with Executive Order 12472. This concept of  national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services  (as defined in Sec. 201.2(g)) includes crises that do not necessarily  entail serious degradation of, or serious threats to, national security.  It therefore is a broader concept than the term ``national security  emergency preparedness activities'' in Executive Order 12656, which  concerns only national security emergencies, and preparedness activities  necessarily related to such emergencies.</p>
