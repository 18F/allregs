                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Waiver of assessment for certain initial periods. No eligible  entity shall pay any assessment associated with the debt guarantee  program for the period from October 14, 2008 through November 12, 2008.  An eligible entity that opts out of the program on or before December 5,  2008 will not pay any assessment under the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice to the FDIC. No guaranteed debt shall be issued by a  participating entity under the FDIC's debt guarantee program unless  notice of the issuance of such debt and payment of associated  assessments is provided to the FDIC as required by this section and, for  guaranteed debt issued after November 21, 2008, the participating entity  agrees to be bound by the terms of the Master Agreement, as set forth on  the FDIC's Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any eligible entity that does not opt out of the debt guarantee  program on or before December 5, 2008, as provided in Sec. 370.5, and  that issues any guaranteed debt during the period from October 14, 2008  through December 5, 2008 which is still outstanding on December 5, 2008,  shall notify the FDIC of that issuance via the FDIC's e-business Web  site FDICconnect on or before December 19, 2008, and the entity's Chief  Financial Officer or equivalent shall certify that the issuances  identified as FDIC-guaranteed debt outstanding at each point of time did  not exceed the debt guarantee limit as set forth in Sec. 370.3</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each participating entity that issues guaranteed debt after  December 5, 2008, shall notify the FDIC of that issuance via the FDIC's  e-business Web site FDICconnect within the time period specified by the  FDIC. The eligible entity's Chief Financial Officer or equivalent shall  certify that the issuance of guaranteed debt does not exceed the debt  guarantee limit as set forth in Sec. 370.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC will provide procedures governing notice to the FDIC  and certification of guaranteed amount limits for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initiation of assessments. Assessments, calculated in accordance  with paragraph (d) of this section, will accrue, with respect to each  eligible entity that does not opt out of the debt guarantee program on  or before December 5, 2008:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> (except for overnight debt), issued by it  on or after October 14, 2008, and on or before December 5, 2008, that is  still outstanding on December 5, 2008; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beginning on December 6, 2008, on all senior unsecured debt, as  defined in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(1)(iii) of Sec. 370.2, issued by  it on or after December 6, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)</em> and (h) of  this section, and except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section,  the amount of assessment will be determined by multiplying the amount of  FDIC-guaranteed debt times   the term of the debt or, in the case of mandatory convertible debt, the  time period from issuance to the mandatory conversion date, times an  annualized assessment rate determined in accordance with the following  table.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The annualized</p><p class="depth0">assessment</p><p class="depth0">For debt with a maturity or time period to conversion   rate (in basis</p><p class="depth0">date of--                          points) is--</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------ 180 days or less (excluding overnight debt).............              50 181-364 days............................................              75 365 days or greater.....................................             100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the debt being issued has a maturity date that occurs after  the expiration date of the guarantee, the expiration date of the  guarantee instead of the maturity date will be used to calculate the  assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount of assessment for a participating entity, other than  an insured depository institution, that controls, directly or  indirectly, or is otherwise affiliated with, at least one insured  depository institution will be determined by multiplying the amount of  FDIC-guaranteed debt times the term of the debt or, in the case of  mandatory convertible debt, the time period from issuance to the  mandatory conversion date, times an annualized assessment rate  determined in accordance with the rates set forth in the table in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that each such rate shall be  increased by 10 basis points, if the combined assets of all insured  depository institutions affiliated with such entity constitute less than  50 percent of consolidated holding company assets. The comparison of  assets for purposes of this paragraph shall be determined as of  September 30, 2008, except that in the case of an entity that becomes an  eligible entity after October 13, 2008, the comparison of assets shall  be determined as of the date that it becomes an eligible entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assessment Invoicing. As soon as the participating entity  provides notice as required in paragraph (b) of this section, the  invoice for the appropriate fee will be automatically generated and  posted on FDICconnect for the account associated with the participating  entity, and the time limits for providing payment in paragraph (g) of  this section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No assessment reduction for early retirement of guaranteed debt.  A participating entity's assessment shall not be reduced if guaranteed  debt is retired prior to its scheduled maturity date or conversion date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Increased assessments for debt exceeding the debt guarantee  limit. Any participating entity that issues guaranteed debt represented  as being guaranteed by the FDIC exceeding its debt guarantee limit as  set forth in Sec. 370.3(b) shall have its applicable assessment rate(s)  for all outstanding guaranteed debt increased by 100 percent for  purposes of the calculations in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The  FDIC may reduce the assessments under this paragraph upon a showing of  good cause by the entity. In addition, any entity making such a  misrepresentation may also be subject to enforcement action under 12  U.S.C. 1818, as further described in Sec. 370.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Long term non-guaranteed debt fee. Each participating entity  that elects to issue long term non-guaranteed debt pursuant to  Sec. 370.3(g) must pay the FDIC a nonrefundable fee equal to 37.5 basis  points times the amount of the entity's senior unsecured debt, as  defined in Sec. 370.2(e)(1)(i), that had a maturity date on or before  June 30, 2009, and was outstanding as of September 30, 2008. If the  entity had no such debt outstanding as of September 30, 2008, the fee  will equal 37.5 basis points times the amount of the entity's debt  guarantee limit established under Sec. 370.3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The nonrefundable fee will be collected in six equal monthly  installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An entity electing the nonrefundable fee option will also be  billed as it issues guaranteed debt under the debt guarantee program,  and the amounts paid as a nonrefundable fee under this paragraph will be  applied to offset these bills until the nonrefundable fee is exhausted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Thereafter, the institution will have to pay additional  assessments on guaranteed debt as it issues the debt, as otherwise  required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Collection of assessments--ACH Debit. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each participating  entity shall take all actions necessary to allow the Corporation to  debit assessments from the participating entity's   designated deposit account as provided for in Sec. 327.3(a)(2). The  assessment payments of a participating entity that is not an insured  depository institution shall be debited from the designated account of  the affiliated insured depository institution it selected for  FDICconnect access under Sec. 370.5(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each participating entity shall ensure that funds in an amount  at least equal to the amount of the assessment are available in the  designated account for direct debit by the Corporation on the first  business day after posting of the invoice on FDICconnect. A  participating entity that is not an insured depository institution shall  provide the necessary funds for payment of its assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(v)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (g) of this section, assessments  shall include all applicable surcharges imposed pursuant to paragraph  (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Surcharges on assessments. (1) For FDIC-guaranteed debt that has  a time period to conversion (in the case of mandatory convertible debt)  or a maturity of one year or more, that is issued on or after April 1,  2009 and on or before June 30, 2009, and that matures or converts on or  before June 30, 2012, the assessment rate provided in the table in  paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section shall be increased by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 10 basis points for such debt that is issued by a participating  entity that is an insured depository institution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 20 basis points for such debt that is issued by any other  participating entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For FDIC-guaranteed debt that has a time period to conversion  (in the case of mandatory convertible debt) or a maturity of one year or  more, and that is either issued on or after April 1, 2009 with a  maturity or conversion date after June 30, 2012, or issued after June  30, 2009, the assessment rate provided in the table in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section shall be increased by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 25 basis points for such debt that is issued by a participating  entity that is an insured depository institution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 50 basis points for such debt that is issued by any other  participating entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assessment for debt issued under the Emergency Guarantee  Facility.
