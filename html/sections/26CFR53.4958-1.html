                                Sec. 53.4958-1  Taxes on excess benefit transactions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Excess benefit defined. An excess benefit is the amount by which  the value of the economic benefit provided by an applicable tax-exempt  organization directly or indirectly to or for the use of any  disqualified person exceeds the value of the consideration (including  the performance of services) received for providing such benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxes paid by disqualified person--(1) Initial tax. Section  4958(a)(1) imposes a tax equal to 25 percent of the excess benefit on  each excess benefit transaction. The section 4958(a)(1) tax shall be  paid by any disqualified person who received an excess benefit from that  excess benefit transaction. With respect to any excess benefit  transaction, if more than one disqualified person is liable for the tax  imposed by section 4958(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, all such persons are jointly and  severally liable for that tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional tax on disqualified person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Section  4958(b) imposes a tax equal to 200 percent of the excess benefit in any  case in which section 4958(a)(1) imposes a 25-percent tax on an excess  benefit transaction and the transaction is not corrected (as defined in  section 4958(f)(6) and Sec. 53.4958-7) within the taxable period (as  defined in section 4958(f)(5) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).  If a disqualified person makes a payment of less than the full  correction amount under the rules of Sec. 53.4958-7, the 200-percent  tax is imposed only on the unpaid portion of the correction amount (as  described in Sec. 53.4958-7(c)). The tax imposed by section 4958(b) is  payable by any disqualified person who received an excess benefit from  the excess benefit transaction on which the initial tax was imposed by  section 4958(a)(1). With respect to any excess benefit transaction, if  more than one disqualified person is liable for the tax imposed by  section 4958(b), all such persons are jointly and severally liable for  that tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable period. Taxable period means, with respect to any  excess benefit transaction, the period beginning with the date on which  the transaction occurs and ending on the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of mailing a notice of deficiency under section 6212  with respect to the section 4958(a)(1) tax; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date on which the tax imposed by section 4958(a)(1) is  assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Abatement if correction during the correction period. For  rules relating to abatement of taxes on excess benefit transactions that  are corrected within the correction period, as defined in section  4963(e), see sections 4961(a), 4962(a), and the regulations thereunder.  The abatement rules of section 4961 specifically provide for a 90-day  correction period after the date of mailing a notice of deficiency under  section 6212 with respect to the section 4958(b) 200-percent tax. If the  excess benefit is corrected during that correction period, the 200- percent tax imposed shall not be assessed, and if assessed the  assessment shall be abated, and if collected shall be credited or  refunded as an overpayment. For special rules relating to abatement of  the 25-percent tax, see section 4962.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tax paid by organization managers--(1) In general. In any case  in which section 4958(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> imposes a tax, section 4958(a)(2) imposes a  tax equal to 10 percent of the excess benefit on the participation of  any organization manager who knowingly participated in the excess  benefit transaction, unless such participation was not willful and was  due to reasonable cause. Any organization manager who so participated in  the excess benefit transaction must pay the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Organization manager defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An organization  manager is, with respect to any applicable tax-exempt organization, any  officer, director, or trustee of such organization, or any individual  having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers,  directors, or trustees of the organization, regardless of title. A  person is an officer of an organization if that person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is specifically so designated under the certificate of  incorporation, by-laws, or other constitutive documents of the  organization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, any person who has authority merely to recommend  particular administrative or policy decisions, but not to implement them  without approval of a superior, is not an officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain committee members. An individual who  is not an officer, director, or trustee, yet serves on a committee of  the governing body of an applicable tax-exempt organization (or as a  designee of the governing body described in Sec. 53.4958-6(c)(1)) that  is attempting to invoke the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness  described in Sec. 53.4958-6 based on the committee's (or designee's)  actions, is an organization manager for purposes of the tax imposed by  section 4958(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Participation. For purposes of section 4958(a)(2) and this  paragraph (d), participation includes silence or inaction on the part of  an organization manager where the manager is under a duty to speak or  act, as well as any affirmative action by such manager. An organization  manager is not considered to have participated in an excess benefit  transaction, however, where the manager has opposed the transaction in a  manner consistent with the fulfillment of the manager's responsibilities  to the applicable tax-exempt organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Knowing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 4958(a)(2) and  this paragraph (d), a manager participates in a transaction knowingly  only if the person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has actual knowledge of sufficient facts so that, based solely  upon those facts, such transaction would be an excess benefit  transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is aware that such a transaction under these circumstances may  violate the provisions of Federal tax law governing excess benefit  transactions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Negligently fails to make reasonable attempts to ascertain  whether the transaction is an excess benefit transaction, or the manager  is in fact aware that it is such a transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amplification of general rule. Knowing does not mean having  reason to know. However, evidence tending to show that a manager has  reason to know of a particular fact or particular rule is relevant in  determining whether the manager had actual knowledge of such a fact or  rule. Thus, for example,   evidence tending to show that a manager has reason to know of sufficient  facts so that, based solely upon such facts, a transaction would be an  excess benefit transaction is relevant in determining whether the  manager has actual knowledge of such facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reliance on professional advice. An organization manager's  participation in a transaction is ordinarily not considered knowing  within the meaning of section 4958(a)(2), even though the transaction is  subsequently held to be an excess benefit transaction, to the extent  that, after full disclosure of the factual situation to an appropriate  professional, the organization manager relies on a reasoned written  opinion of that professional with respect to elements of the transaction  within the professional's expertise. For purposes of section 4958(a)(2)  and this paragraph (d), a written opinion is reasoned even though it  reaches a conclusion that is subsequently determined to be incorrect so  long as the opinion addresses itself to the facts and the applicable  standards. However, a written opinion is not reasoned if it does nothing  more than recite the facts and express a conclusion. The absence of a  written opinion of an appropriate professional with respect to a  transaction shall not, by itself, however, give rise to any inference  that an organization manager participated in the transaction knowingly.  For purposes of this paragraph, appropriate professionals on whose  written opinion an organization manager may rely, are limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Legal counsel, including in-house counsel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certified public accountants or accounting firms with expertise  regarding the relevant tax law matters; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Independent valuation experts who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hold themselves out to the public as appraisers or compensation  consultants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Perform the relevant valuations on a regular basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Are qualified to make valuations of the type of property or  services involved; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)(C)(1)</em> through (3) of this section  are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Satisfaction of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. An  organization manager's participation in a transaction is ordinarily not  considered knowing within the meaning of section 4958(a)(2), even though  the transaction is subsequently held to be an excess benefit  transaction, if the appropriate authorized body has met the requirements  of Sec. 53.4958-6(a) with respect to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Willful. For purposes of section 4958(a)(2) and this paragraph  (d), participation by an organization manager is willful if it is  voluntary, conscious, and intentional. No motive to avoid the  restrictions of the law or the incurrence of any tax is necessary to  make the participation willful. However, participation by an  organization manager is not willful if the manager does not know that  the transaction in which the manager is participating is an excess  benefit transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Due to reasonable cause. An organization manager's participation  is due to reasonable cause if the manager has exercised responsibility  on behalf of the organization with ordinary business care and prudence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Limits on liability for management. The maximum aggregate amount  of tax collectible under section 4958(a)(2) and this paragraph (d) from  organization managers with respect to any one excess benefit transaction  is $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Joint and several liability. In any case where more than one  person is liable for a tax imposed by section 4958(a)(2), all such  persons shall be jointly and severally liable for the taxes imposed  under section 4958(a)(2) with respect to that excess benefit  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Burden of proof. For provisions relating to the burden of proof  in cases involving the issue of whether an organization manager has  knowingly participated in an excess benefit transaction, see section  7454(b) and Sec. 301.7454-2 of this chapter. In these cases, the  Commissioner bears the burden of proof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Date of occurrence--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided, an excess benefit transaction occurs on the date on which the  disqualified person receives the economic benefit for Federal income tax  purposes. When a single   contractual arrangement provides for a series of compensation or other  payments to (or for the use of) a disqualified person over the course of  the disqualified person's taxable year (or part of a taxable year), any  excess benefit transaction with respect to these aggregate payments is  deemed to occur on the last day of the taxable year (or if the payments  continue for part of the year, the date of the last payment in the  series).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> and (l)  and the regulations thereunder for statute of limitations rules as they  apply to section 4958 excise taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date for imposition of taxes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  section 4958 taxes imposed on excess benefit transactions or on  participation in excess benefit transactions apply to transactions  occurring on or after September 14, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Existing binding contracts. The section 4958 taxes do not apply  to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written contract that was  binding on September 13, 1995, and at all times thereafter before the  transaction occurs. A written binding contract that is terminable or  subject to cancellation by the applicable tax-exempt organization  without the disqualified person's consent (including as the result of a  breach of contract by the disqualified person) and without substantial  penalty to the organization, is no longer treated as a binding contract  as of the earliest date that any such termination or cancellation, if  made, would be effective. If a binding written contract is materially  changed, it is treated as a new contract entered into as of the date the  material change is effective. A material change includes an extension or  renewal of the contract (other than an extension or renewal that results  from the person contracting with the applicable tax-exempt organization  unilaterally exercising an option expressly granted by the contract), or  a more than incidental change to any payment under the contract.
