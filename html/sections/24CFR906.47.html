                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. HUD environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 58 apply  to this part, unless, under Sec. 58.11 of this title, HUD itself  performs the environmental review under 24 CFR part 50. The PHA  conducting a homeownership program under this part must comply with this  section and part 50 or 58, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(15)</em> of this title are still  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public housing units in the PHA's inventory. Before the PHA  rehabilitates or repairs units in its inventory for use for  homeownership, or expends or commits HUD or local funds for such  activities, the responsible entity must comply with part 58 and the PHA,  where required, must submit and receive HUD approval of its request for  release of funds, or HUD must have completed any part 50 environmental  review and notified the PHA of its approval of the property. HUD may not  release funds under this part before the appropriate approval is  obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Units to be acquired with federal funds and used for public  housing homeownership. A PHA may not enter into any contract for  acquisition of real property to be used in a homeownership program  unless the required environmental reviews have been performed and  approvals have been obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Specific units unidentified. Where the PHA's homeownership  program contemplates acquisition of properties not identified at the  time of submission, the PHA must certify that it will   comply with this section, including paragraph (f) of this section, prior  to such acquisition or construction. HUD may conditionally approve such  a homeownership program; however, HUD will not give final approval of  any site or unit until the required environmental review has been  completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information. The PHA shall supply all relevant information  necessary for the responsible entity, or HUD, if applicable, to perform  the environmental review for each property included in the homeownership  program, and, if necessary, shall carry out mitigating measures or  select alternate eligible properties. Where HUD performs the  environmental review, the PHA shall comply with 24 CFR 50.3(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-exclusivity. Nothing in this section relieves the  participating PHA, and its partners and contractors, from complying with  all requirements of 24 CFR part 50 or part 58, as applicable.</p>
