                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Legislative authority. Section 111 of the River and Harbor Act  of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-483, approved August 13, 1968) states:</p><p class="depth0">The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers is  authorized to investigate, study, and construct projects for the  prevention or mitigation of shore damages attributable to Federal  navigation works. The cost of installing, operation and maintaining  shall be borne entirely by the United States. No such projects shall be  constructed without specific authorization by Congress if the estimated  first cost exceeds $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal navigation works is defined as a  project or feature thereof that has been specifically authorized by the  Congress in a River and   Harbor Act or authorized under the continuing authorities granted by  section 201 or the Flood Control Act of 1965, or by section 107 of the  River and Harbor Act of 1960, as amended. These shall include projects  or project features built by others but which have been adopted as a  Federal Navigation project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beach erosion control project is defined as a project that has  been specifically authorized by the Congress in a River and Harbor Act  or authorized under the continuing authorities granted by section 201 of  the Flood Control Act of 1965 or by section 103 of the River and Harbor  Act of 1962. This is considered to include the beach erosion control  portion of combined beach erosion and hurricane protection projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Mitigation of shore damages is defined as the construction of  works or procedures to reduce erosion-type damages by shoreline  stabilization. The degree of mitigation is the reduction of erosion or  accretion to the level which would be obtained without the influence of  navigation works at the time navigation works were accepted as a Federal  responsibility. It is not intended that shorelines be restored to  historic dimensions, but only to lessen the damages by an action that  can be justified, the entire costs of which are Federal regardless of  shore ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General policies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This Act authorizes the study,  construction and maintenance of work for prevention or mitigation of  damages to both public and privately owned shores to the extent of the  damages that can be directly identified and attributed to Federal  navigation work located along the coastal and Great Lakes shorelines of  the United States. This authority will not be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For construction of works for prevention or mitigation of shore  damages such as those caused by river bank erosion or vessel generated  wave wash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To modify navigation projects authorized, but not constructed,  that contain features for prevention or mitigation of shore damages or  to change the responsibility for maintenance or to modify portions of  constructed navigation projects that contain features for prevention or  mitigation of shore damages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For prevention or mitigation of shore damages caused by non- Federal navigation projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To construct, maintain, modify or change the cost sharing of  authorized beach erosion or combined beach erosion and hurricane  protection projects, or portions thereof, located adjacent to Federal  navigation projects. Except, when it is determined that shore damage to  a portion of an authorized beach erosion project is attributable to the  navigation project, mitigation measures may be accomplished under this  authority, only to the extent of damages that can be directly identified  and attributed to the navigation project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the erosion attributable to the Federal navigation project  consists of only a portion of the total erosion problem in a specific  area and cannot be considered as a separable reach for effective  mitigation measures then a section 111 project cannot be considered for  authorization unless,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There is an authorized beach erosion control or combined beach  and hurricane protection project for the area with which the section 111  mitigation measures could be combined to become effective, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A general study of the entire problem area is made and leads to  the development of an authorized beach erosion control project,  (specific authority must be obtained to conduct a general study of the  entire problem area) or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Local interests indicate a willingness to have the erosion  problem outside the scope of section 111 remedied at local cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cost limitations. Section 111 provides that the Chief of  Engineers has authority to authorize projects for which the estimated  first costs will not exceed $1,000,000. The first costs will be the cost  of the initial preventive or mitigative measures only. The limitation on  costs does not include the cost of project maintenance. The project must  be planned as a complete unit and not broken into reaches or stages for  cost limitation purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reports. The Recon Report required by Sec. 263.15(c)(1) will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether or not Federal navigation works are  responsible for causing or contributing to the erosion problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine the extent of the area affected by the navigation  works.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine total area experiencing significant erosion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determine the approximate percentage of the total erosion  problem in a specific area that is attributable to the navigation works.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recommend whether further study of the specific area affected by  the Federal navigation works is justified and whether study of the  entire area is desirable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Evaluation of mitigation measures. The objective of section 111  is to provide mitigation measures for shore damages attributable to  Federal navigation projects, when equitable and in the public interest.  All practicable alternatives, structural and non-structural should be  identified and considered. Work recommended for construction should  provide the most practicable and economical means of mitigating existing  damages or the prevention of subsequent damages. Justification of  mitigation measures should be made by comparing their costs with the  values represented by the damages preventable. Any intangible values  should be described and given due weight along with the tangible values  in this justification. Exercise of the authority of section 111 to  provide mitigation measures at Federal expense is not mandatory. A  finding for or against its use should fully consider the pre-project  conditions and the justification of incurring mitigation costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Criteria for a Favorable Recommendation. A recommendation  favorable to adoption and construction of work to prevent or mitigate  shore damage attributable to a Federal navigation project under the  authority of section 111 of the River and Harbor Act of 1968 may be  considered warranted when both of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The navigation project has been determined to be the cause of  the damage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Analysis based on sound engineering and economic principles  clearly demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Cost sharing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Construction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the work recommended in  the report is confined to mitigation work only under section 111, i.e.,  erosion totally attributable to the navigation works, costs will be 100  percent Federal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the work recommended is a combination of mitigation under  section 111 and restoration of beaches eroded due to other causes and  there is no authorized beach erosion project, mitigation work under  section 111 will be 100 percent Federal and the remaining work will be  100 percent local.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the work recommended in the report is a combination of  mitigation under section 111 and the restoration of beaches under an  authorized beach erosion project or combination beach erosion-hurricane  protection project, the mitigation work under section 111 will be 100  percent Federal and the remainder in accordance with the cost sharing  procedures as specified in project authorization documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the initial work is confined to mitigation  under section 111, all maintenance costs are 100 percent Federal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the work is a combination of mitigation under section 111  and restoration of beaches eroded due to other causes, and there is no  authorized beach erosion project, maintenance costs will be shared in  the same proportion as recommended for initial construction, i.e., the  section 111 portion will be 100 percent Federal and remaining work 100  percent local.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the work is a combination of mitigation under section 111  and an authorized beach erosion control project or combination beach  erosion-hurricane protection project, the Federal maintenance cost for  the mitigation work under section 111 will be in the same proportion as  the damage attributed to the Federal navigation work is to the total  damage. For the remaining work the cost sharing procedures of the  authorized beach erosion or combined beach erosion-hurricane protection  project will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Local cooperation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The law as written provided that the cost  of installing, operating and maintaining projects under this authority  shall be   borne entirely by the United States; therefore there are no requirements  for local cooperation. The cost of any lands, easements or rights-of-way  required for construction or subsequent maintenance will be borne  entirely by the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em> local interests will be required to  furnish assurance of local cooperation similar to those required for  regularly authorized projects for their assigned portion of the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where section 111 projects are to be accomplished in conjunction  with authorized projects, the requirements of local cooperation  specified in the authorizing document or report will apply.

Appendix B to Part 263--Application of Multiobjective Planning</p><p class="depth0">Framework to Continuing Authorities Program</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The planning process described in the ER 1105-2-200  series of regulations including the implementation of Federal planning  and evaluation criteria, are generally applicable to studies conducted  under the Continuing Authorities Program. However, due to the limited  scope of many of the plans and projects considered under this program,  modification of the process is appropriate. Specific modification of the  requirements of the planning criteria is not appropriate since the  legislative and executive authorities setting forth these criteria do  not differentiate between various types of level C implementation  studies. Discretion must be employed by reporting officers and reviewers  of Detailed Project Reports to insure that projects recommended for  implementation by the Corps have been selected on the basis of  information and analyses consistent with the WRC Principles and  Standards, while at the same time keeping the requirements for  information and analyses consistent with the scope of the study,  solutions recommended, and the Program completion-time objectives  outlined in Sec. 263.18 of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Plan Formulation Stages.</p><p class="depth0">a. Stage 1--Reconnaissance Study (Recon). As presented in para. 6c,  a Reconnaissance will replace the Development of a Plan of Study as the  primary element of Stage 1 planning. As a general rule, a Recon should  be conducted by a study team consisting of an engineer, an economist,  and an environmentalist. A one-to-two day field reconnaissance should be  sufficient to analyze the need for a project, to develop sketch plans,  discuss views and capabilities of local interests, and identify the  economy of the potential project area and possible environmental issues  that would need to be addressed if a feasibility study were to be  conducted. Additional effort should pinpoint all data deficiencies,  types of investigations required for the feasibility study, and the  estimated cost of the study. The latter identification process can be  developed as a Plan of Study for the feasibility study, if approved and  funded. To accomplish the intended purpose of the Recon, within the time  and cost objectives given in this regulation, reporting officers are not  required to develop a specific project (except for emergency situations  under Section 14 or 3 Authorities), but should only provide the  information required to make a decision as to whether there is a Federal  interest in conducting a feasibility study. Mature, seasoned judgment is  a prime requisite.</p><p class="depth0">b. Stage 2--Development of Alternative Plans. While the ER 1105-2- 200 series of regulations provides for a three-stage development of  plans, studies under Continuing Authorities may consolidate these two  final stages (intermediate and detailed), into a single stage, if  appropriate. This consolidation does not eliminate any of the planning  tasks, as discussed in para 3 below, nor does it diminish the concept of  screening a full array of alternatives including nonstructural measures,  with increasing levels of detail in the assessment of impacts and  evaluation as planning progresses to plan selection. The primary  emphasis in making the consolidation of these two stages is that the  plan selection is normally made on the basis of more limited data and  analyses than appropriate for studies conducted under the Level C Survey  Program or the Phase I AE&D; Program.</p><p class="depth0">c. Stage 3--Development of Recommended Plan. The feasibility study  under the Continuing Authorities Program will include the design of a  recommended plan to the extent necessary to proceed directly from the  Detailed Project Report to preparation of plans and specifications.  While studies under the Level C Survey Program would complete plan  formulation prior to accomplishing detailed project design, the nature  of this Program necessitates a flexible design phase, wherein changes in  scope of the selected plan, with accompanying changes in project impacts  and evaluation, are to be expected and handled by planning personnel in  order that the DPR will reflect a selected plan consistent with  completed detailed design and a plan justified under the current Federal  evaluation criteria for recommending Federal participation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Planning Tasks.</p><p class="depth0">a. Problem Identification. While planning under Continuing  Authorities is to be on a multi-objective basis, the range of problems  that can be addressed under a particular Program authority is more  limited than normally considered in the conduct of studies specifically  authorized by Congress. A good effort to focus the study on relevant  problems should be made in the Recon phase of the study, while more  intense efforts at data collection and definition of the problems and  associated needs should be accomplished during Stage 2 planning.</p><p class="depth0">b. Formulation of Alternatives. There are no fundamental differences  in the process of formulating alternatives under these Program  authorities than in Level C Survey studies, with the exception that the  array of alternatives will normally be more limited based on the  discussion in para 3a above. The level of detail to which the  alternatives are formulated, with associated assessments of impacts and  evaluation of beneficial and adverse contributions, will vary greatly  depending on the study authority. In some cases, alternatives will be  screened and eliminated for various reasons without full development of  a tentative plan which can be   assessed and evaluated. Such screening is consistent with the nature of  this Program; however, good judgment and interdisciplinary participation  should be emphasized in such preliminary screenings. The guidance in the  ER 1105-2-200 series of regulations with regard to consideration of non- structural measures and formulation of NED and EQ plans, is fully  applicable to studies conducted under this Program.</p><p class="depth0">c. Impact Assessment. There is no difference in the requirements for  the assessment of impacts for studies conducted under Continuing  Authorities and those under the Level C Survey Program. As in all  studies, the extent to which information is obtained to adequately  assess impacts of alternative plans is a matter of discretion of the  reporting officer, bearing in mind the requirements of the National  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and Section 122, Public Law 91- 611.</p><p class="depth0">d. Evaluation. The processes, analyses and displays for evaluation  of alternative plans as prescribed in the ER 1105-2-200 series of  regulations are generally applicable to studies conducted under  Continuing Authorities. Again, the level of detail, and not the process  itself, is to be consistent with the study authority and the needs of  the decision-making process.</p>
