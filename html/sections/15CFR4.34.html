The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

The reasons for asserting the exemption are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process; to ensure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities; to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques; to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information; to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information; and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel. Special note is taken that the proviso clause in this exemption imports due process and procedural protections for the individual.

Special note is made of the limitation on the extent to which this exemption may be asserted. The existence and general character of the information exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At the present time, the Department claims no exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (3), (6) and (7).
