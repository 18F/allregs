                                Sec. 1.61-15  Options received as payment of income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.61- 2(d)(6)(i) (relating to certain restricted property transferred after  June 30, 1969), if any person receives an option in payment of an amount  constituting compensation of such person (or any other person), such  option is subject to the rules contained in Sec. 1.421-6 for purposes  of determining when income is realized in connection with such option  and the amount of such income. In this regard, the rules of Sec. 1.421- 6 apply to an option received in payment of an amount constituting  compensation regardless of the form of the transaction. Thus, the rules  of Sec. 1.421-6 apply to an option transferred for less than its fair  market value in a transaction taking the form of a sale or exchange if  the difference between the amount paid for the option and its fair  market value at the time of transfer is the payment of an amount  constituting compensation of the transferee or any other person. This  section, for example, makes the rules of Sec. 1.421-6 applicable to  options granted in whole or partial payment for services of an  independent contractor. If an amount of money or property is paid for an  option to which this paragraph applies, then the amount paid shall be  part of the basis of such option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Options to which paragraph (a) does not apply. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (a)  of this section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An option which is subject to the rules contained in section  421; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An option which is not granted as the payment of an amount  constituting compensation, such as an option which is acquired solely as  an investment (including an option which is part of an investment unit  described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1232-3). For rules relating to the  taxation of options described in this subdivision, see section 1234 and  the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a person acquires an option which is not subject to the rules  contained in section 421, and if such option has a readily ascertainable  fair market value, such person may establish that such option was not  acquired as payment of an amount constituting compensation by showing  that the amount of money or its equivalent paid for the option equaled  the readily ascertainable fair market value of the option. If a person  acquires an option which is not subject to the rules contained in  section 421, and if such option does not have a readily ascertainable  fair market value, then to establish that such option was not acquired  as payment of an amount constituting compensation, such person must show  that, from an examination of all the surrounding circumstances, there  was no reason for the option to have been granted as the payment of an  amount constituting compensation. For example, such person must show  that he had neither rendered nor was obligated to render substantial  services in consideration for the granting of the option. In determining  whether an option, such as an option acquired in connection with an  obligation as part of an investment unit, has been granted as  compensation for services, the ordinary services performed by an  investor in his own self-interest in connection with his investing  activities will not be treated as the consideration for the grant of the  option. For example, if a small business investment company takes an  active part in the management of its debtor small business company, the  rendering of such management services will not be treated as the  consideration for the granting of the option, provided such services are  rendered for an independent consideration, or are merely protective of  the small business investment company's investment in the borrower. See  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.421-6 for the meaning of the term ``readily  ascertainable fair market value.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Statement required in connection with certain options. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any  person acquiring any option to purchase securities (other than an option  described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) shall attach a  statement to his income tax return for the taxable year in which the  option was acquired. For the definition of the term ``securities'', see  section 165(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The statement otherwise required by subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph shall not be required with respect to the following options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Options subject to the rules contained in section 305(a) or  section 421;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Options acquired as part of an investment unit consisting of an  option and a debenture, note, or other similar obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If such unit is acquired as part of a public offering and the  amount of money or its equivalent paid for such unit is not less than  the public offering price, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If such unit is actively traded on an established market and the  amount of money or its equivalent paid for such unit is not less than  the price paid for such unit in contemporaneous purchases of such unit  by persons independent of both the seller and the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Options acquired as part of a public offering, if the amount  of money or its equivalent paid for such option is not less than the  public offering price; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Options which are actively traded on an established market and  which are acquired for money or its equivalent at a price not less than  the price paid for such options in contemporaneous purchases of such  options by persons independent of both the seller and the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Description of the securities subject to the option (including  number of shares of stock);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Period during which the option is exercisable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the option had a readily ascertainable fair market  value at date of grant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whether the option is subject to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  indicates either that the option is not subject to paragraph (a) of this  section, or that the option is subject to paragraph (a) of this section  but that such option had a readily ascertainable fair market value at  date of grant, then such statement shall contain the following  additional information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Option price;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Value at date of grant of securities subject to the option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restrictions (if any) on exercise or transfer of option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Restrictions (if any) on transfer of securities subject to the  option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Value of the option (if readily ascertainable);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> How value of option was determined;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Amount of money (or its equivalent) paid for the option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Person from whom the option was acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A concise description of the circumstances surrounding the  acquisition of the option and any other factors relied upon by the  taxpayer to establish that the option is not subject to paragraph (a) of  this section, or, if the option is treated by the taxpayer as subject to  paragraph (a) of this section, that the option had a readily  ascertainable fair market value at date of grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply to options granted  after July 11, 1963, other than options required to be granted pursuant  to the terms of a written contract entered into on or before such date.
