                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment in full. Payment in full of a loan is handled according  to subpart D of part 1951 of this chapter. When a loan is paid in full,  the servicing official will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the company providing fidelity bond coverage in writing  that the government no longer has an interest in the bond if the  government is named co-obligee on the bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Release FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  interest in insurance policies according to applicable provisions of  subpart A of part 1806 (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 Instruction 426.1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Release FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  interest in any other security as appropriate, consulting with OGC if  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan summary statements. Upon request of a borrower, FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will issue a loan summary  statement showing account activity for each loan made or insured under  the CONACT. Field offices will post a notice on the bulletin board  informing borrowers of the availability of loan summary statements. See  exhibit A of subpart A of this part for a sample of the required notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loan summary statement period is from January 1 through  December 31. The Finance Office forwards to field offices a copy of Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951-9, ``Annual  Statement of Loan Account,'' to be retained in borrower files as a  permanent record of account activity for the year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1951-9 are retained in the Finance Office on microfiche. These  statements reflect cumulative data from the beginning of the current  year through the end of the most recent quarter. Servicing offices may  request copies of these quarterly or annual statements by sending Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951-57, ``Request  for Loan Summary Statement,'' to the Finance Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The servicing office will provide a copy of the applicable loan  summary statement to the borrower on request. A copy of Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951-9 and, for loans with  unamortized installments, a printout of future installments owed  obtained using the borrower status screen option in the Automated  Discrepancy Processing System (ADPS), will constitute the loan summary  statement to be provided to the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Insurance. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  borrowers shall maintain insurance coverage as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Community and Insured Business Programs borrowers shall  continuously maintain adequate insurance coverage as required by the  loan agreement and Sec. 1942.17(j)(3) of subpart A of part 1942 of this  chapter. Insurance coverage must be monitored in accordance with the  above-referenced section to determine that adequate policies and bonds  are in force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other types of loans covered by this subpart, property  insurance will be serviced according to subpart A of part 1806 of this  chapter (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Instruction 426.1) in real estate mortgage cases, and according to the  loan agreement in other cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Property taxes. Real property taxes are serviced according to  Subpart A of part 1925 of this chapter. If State statutes permit a  personal property tax lien to have priority over FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354's lien, such taxes are serviced  according to Sec. Sec. 1925.3 and 1925.4 of subpart A of part 1925 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Changes in borrower's legal organization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State Director  may approve, with OGC's concurrence, changes in a recipient's legal  organization, including revisions of articles of incorporation or  charter and bylaws, when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The change does not provide for a sole member type of  organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower retains control over its assets and the operation,  management, and maintenance of the facility, and continues to carry out  its responsibilities as set forth in Sec. 1942.17(b)(4) of subpart A of  part 1942 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The borrower retains significant local ties with the rural  community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State Director may approve, with prior concurrence of the  Administrator, changes in a recipient's legal organization which result  in a sole member type of organization, or any other change which results  in a recipient's loss of control over its assets and/or the operation,  management and maintenance of the facility, provided all of the  following have been or will be met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The change is in the best interest of the Government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State Director determines and documents that other  servicing options under this subpart, such as sale or transfer and  assumption, have been explored and are not feasible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loan is classified as a nonprogram loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The borrower is notified that it is no longer eligible for any  program benefits, but will remain responsible under the loan agreement;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Prior concurrence of the Administrator is obtained. Requests  will be forwarded to the Administrator: Attention (appropriate program  division), and will include the case file; Exhibit A of this subpart  (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  office), appropriately completed; the proposed changes; OGC comments;  and any other necessary supporting information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Membership liability. As a loan approval requirement, some  borrowers may have special agreements with members of the purchase of  shares of stock or for payment of a pro rata share of the loan in the  event of default, or they may have authority in their corporate  instruments to make special assessments in that event. Such agreements  may be referred to as individual liability agreements and may be  assigned to and held by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 as additional security. In other cases the borrower's note may  be endorsed by individuals. The liability instruments will be serviced  in a manner indicated by their contents and the advice of OGC to  adequately protect FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354's interest. Servicing actions necessary due to such provisions will  be tracked in the Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other security. Other security such as collateral assignments,  water stock certificates, notices of lienholder interest (Bureau of Land  Management grazing permits) and waivers of grazing privileges (Forest  Service grazing permits) will be serviced to protect the interest of  FmHA or its successor agency   under Public Law 103-354, and in compliance with any special servicing  actions developed by the State Director with OGC assistance. Evidence of  the security will be filed in the servicing office case file. Necessary  servicing actions will be noted in MFIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Correcting errors in security instruments. Land, buildings, or  chattels included in a mortgage through mutual mistake may be released  from the mortgage by the State Director when substantiated by the  factual situation. The release is contingent on the State Director  determining, with OGC advice, that the property was included due to  mutual error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Present market value determination. For purposes of this  subpart, the value of security is determined by the approval official as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Security representing a relatively small portion of the total  value of the security property. The approval official will determine  that the real estate and chattels are disposed of at a reasonable price.  A current appraisal report may be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Security representing a relatively large portion of the total  value of the security property. The approval official will require a  current appraisal report, and the sale prices of the real estate and  chattels disposed of will at least equal the present market value as  determined by this appraisal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appraisal report. If required, a current appraisal report will  be completed in accordance with Sec. 1942.3 of subpart A of part 1942  of this chapter. The appraisal will be completed by a qualified FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee or an independent  appraiser as determined appropriate by the approval official.
