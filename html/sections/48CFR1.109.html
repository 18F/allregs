                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 41 U.S.C. 1908 requires that the FAR Council periodically adjust all statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds in the FAR for inflation, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This adjustment is calculated every 5 years, starting in October 2005, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all-urban consumers, and supersedes the applicability of any other provision of law that provides for the adjustment of such acquisition-related dollar thresholds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The statute defines an acquisition-related dollar threshold as a dollar threshold that is specified in law as a factor in defining the scope of the applicability of a policy, procedure, requirement, or restriction provided in that law to the procurement of supplies or services by an executive agency, as determined by the FAR Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The statute does not permit escalation of acquisition-related dollar thresholds established by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 41 U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The United States Trade Representative pursuant to the authority of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2511 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A matrix showing calculation of the most recent escalation adjustments of statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds is available via the Internet at http://www.regulations.gov (search FAR case 2014-022).
