                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A LEC shall implement throughout each state in which it offers  telephone exchange service intraLATA and interLATA toll dialing parity  based on LATA boundaries. When a single LATA covers more than one state,  the LEC shall use the implementation procedures that each state has  approved for the LEC within that state's borders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A LEC shall implement toll dialing parity through a  presubscription process that permits a customer to select a carrier to  which all designated calls on a customer's line will be routed  automatically. LECs shall allow a customer to presubscribe, at a  minimum, to one telecommunications carrier for all interLATA toll calls  and to presubscribe to the same or to another telecommunications carrier  for all intraLATA toll calls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A LEC may not assign automatically a customer's intraLATA toll  traffic to itself, to its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the customer's  presubscribed interLATA or interstate toll carrier, or to any other  carrier, except when, in a state that already has implemented  intrastate, intraLATA toll dialing parity, the subscriber has selected  the same presubscribed carrier for both intraLATA and interLATA toll  calls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section, states may require that toll dialing parity be based on  state boundaries if it deems that the provision of intrastate and  interstate toll dialing parity is procompetitive and otherwise in the  public interest.
