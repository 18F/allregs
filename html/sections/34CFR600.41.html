For a foreign graduate medical school that opted to have the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) calculate and provide the pass rates directly to the Secretary for the preceding calendar year as permitted under Sec.  600.55(d)(2) in lieu of the foreign graduate medical school providing pass rate data to the Secretary under Sec.  600.55(d)(1)(iii), the ECFMG's calculations of the school's rates are conclusive; and the presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the computation of the rate or rates by the ECFMG.
