                                Sec. 1000.244  If the recipient has made a good-faith effort to   unsuccessful through no fault of its own, may the Secretary waive  the requirement for a cooperation agreement and a tax exemption?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes. Recipients must submit a written request for waiver to the  recipient's Area ONAP. The request must detail a good faith effort by  the recipient, identify the housing units involved, and include all  pertinent background information about the housing units. The recipient  must further demonstrate that it has pursued and exhausted all  reasonable channels available to it to reach an agreement to obtain tax- exempt status, and that failure to obtain the required agreement and  tax-exempt status has been through no fault of its own. The Area ONAP  will forward the request, its recommendation, comments, and any  additional relevant documentation to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Native American Programs for processing to the Assistant Secretary.
