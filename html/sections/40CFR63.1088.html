                            <p class="depth0">You may delay the repair of heat exchange systems if the leaking equipment is isolated from the process. You

may also delay repair if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, and you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you are not required to have a special shutdown before that planned shutdown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you may delay repair if a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. You must document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. The documentation process must include the activities in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State the reason(s) for delaying repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flow rate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger and by the expected duration of the delay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine emissions of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If repair is delayed because the necessary equipment, parts or personnel are not available, you may delay repair a maximum of 120 calendar days. You must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts or personnel were not available.</p><p class="depth2">Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems</p>
