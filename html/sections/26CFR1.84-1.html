                                Sec. 1.84-1  Transfer of appreciated property to political
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transfer defined. A transfer after May 7, 1974, of property to a  political organization (as defined in section 527(e)(1), and including a  newsletter fund to the extent provided under section 527(g)) is treated  as a sale of the property to the political organization if the fair  market value of the property exceeds its adjusted basis. The transferor  is treated as having realized an amount equal to the fair market value  of the property on the date of the transfer. For purposes of this  section, a transfer is any assignment, conveyance, or delivery of  property other than a bona fide sale for an adequate and full  consideration in money or money's worth, whether the transfer is in  trust or otherwise, whether the transfer is direct or indirect and  whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible. Thus,  for example, a sale at less than fair market value (other than an  ordinary trade discount), or a receipt of property by a political  organization under an agency agreement entitling the organization to  sell the property and retain all or a portion of the proceeds of the  sale, is a transfer within the meaning, of this section. The term  ``transfer'' also includes an illegal contribution of property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount realized. A transferor to whom this section applies  realizes an amount equal to the fair market value of the property on the  date of the transfer. For purposes of this section, the definition of  fair market value set forth in Sec. 1.170A-1(c) (2) and (3) is  incorporated by reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount recognized. A transferor to whom this section applies is  treated as having sold the property to the political organization on the  date of the transfer. Therefore, the rules of chapter 1 of subtitle A  (relating to income tax) apply to the gain realized under this section  as if this gain were an amount realized upon the sale of the property.  These rules include those of section 55 and section 56 (relating to  minimum tax for tax preference), section 306 (relating to disposition of  certain stock), section 1201 (relating to the alternative tax on certain  capital gains), section 1245 (relating to gain from dispositions of  certain depreciable property), and section 1250 (relating to gain from  dispositions of certain depreciable realty).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Holding period. The holding period of property transferred to a  political organization to which this section applies begins on the day  after the date of acquisition of the property by the political  organization.
