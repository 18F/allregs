Overseas commanders may  also authorize any use of such property which is necessary in the  accomplishment of the DA mission for which the property was acquired.  All other proposed uses will be coordinated with the United States  diplomatic mission in the country involved prior to submission to HQDA  (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, for approval. Where the overseas commander is  authorized to approve such use, the commander or designee will prepare  and execute the necessary grant.</p>
