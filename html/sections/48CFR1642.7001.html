Examples of situations in which a Management Agreement may be accepted by OPM are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria for a novation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While a request for a novation is pending;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> While awaiting a decision on a request for a novation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As an interim measure, when the timing of a transfer of assets or the timing of a carrier's withdrawal make administration of the contract inconvenient;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When it is not in the interests of the Government to either recognize a successor in interest or to immediately terminate the existing FEHBP contract.</p>
