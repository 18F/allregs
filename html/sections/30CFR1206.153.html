                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is processed by the lessee and any other gas production to which this subpart applies and that is not subject to the valuation provisions of Sec. 1206.152 of this part. This section applies where the lessee's contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises that right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is processed by the lessee and any other gas production to which this subpart applies and that is not subject to the valuation provisions of Sec. 1206.152 of this part. This section applies where the lessee's contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises that right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to this section shall be the combined value of the residue gas and all gas plant products determined pursuant to this section, plus the value of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing determined pursuant to Sec. 1206.102 of this part, less applicable transportation allowances and processing allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(i)</em> The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In conducting these reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the residue gas or gas plant product. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the ONRR may require that the residue gas or gas plant product sold pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value of the residue gas or gas plant product because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the residue gas or gas plant product be valued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. However, if ONRR determines that the price specified in the transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the value of residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be determined by ONRR, and due consideration will be given to all valuation criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by ONRR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ONRR may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the residue gas or gas plant product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The value of residue gas or any gas plant product which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of like quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same processing plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from nearby plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of residue gas or gas plant products, volume, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the residue gas or gas plant products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A value determined by consideration of other information relevant in valuing like-quality residue gas or gas plant products, including gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or other nearby processing plants, posted prices for residue gas or gas plant products, prices received in spot sales of residue gas or gas plant products, other reliable public sources of price or market information, and other information as to the particular lease operation or the saleability of such residue gas or gas plant products; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal law at which any residue gas or gas plant products may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant to this section, then ONRR shall accept such maximum price as the value. For the purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal law at which any residue gas or gas plant products may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant to this section, then ONRR shall accept such maximum price as the value. For the purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The limitation prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply to residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and valued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and ONRR will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines upon review or audit that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and ONRR will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines upon review or audit that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the authorized ONRR or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like-quality residue gas and gas plant products sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the same processing plant or from nearby processing plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lessee shall notify ONRR if it has determined any value pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to the ONRR Director for Office of Natural Resources or his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first reports royalties on a Form ONRR-2014 using a valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If ONRR determines that a lessee has not properly determined value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are due based upon the value established by ONRR. The lessee shall also pay interest computed on that difference pursuant to Sec. 1218.54 of this chapter. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, ONRR will provide instructions for the taking of that credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The lessee may request a value determination from ONRR. In that event, the lessee shall propose to ONRR a value determination method, and may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until ONRR issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal. The ONRR shall expeditiously determine the value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. In making a value determination, ONRR may use any of the valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After ONRR issues its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for residue gas and/or any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances and processing allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The lessee must place residue gas and gas plant products in marketable condition and market the residue gas and gas plant products for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value established under this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the residue gas or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market the residue gas and gas plant products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part,

or timely, for a quantity of residue gas or gas plant product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in a redetermination by ONRR of value under this section shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Certain information submitted to ONRR to support valuation proposals, including transportation allowances, processing allowances or extraordinary cost allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requests for information about determinations made under this part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2.
