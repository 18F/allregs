                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aviation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board is responsible for the organization,  conduct, and control of all accident and incident investigations (see  Sec. 830.2 of this chapter) within the Untied States, its territories  and possessions, where the accident or incident involves any civil  aircraft or certain public aircraft (as specified in Sec. 830.5 of this  chapter), including an investigation involving civil or public aircraft  (as specified in Sec. 830.5) on the one hand, and an Armed Forces or  intelligence agency aircraft on the other hand. It is also responsible  for investigating accidents/incidents that occur outside the United  States, and which involve civil aircraft and/or certain public aircraft,  when the accident/incident is not in the territory of another country  (i.e., in international waters).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain aviation investigations may be conducted by the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), pursuant to a ``Request to the Secretary  of the Department of Transportation to Investigate Certain Aircraft  Accidents,'' effective February 10, 1977 (the text of the request is  contained in the appendix to part 800 of this chapter), but the Board  determines the probable cause of   such accidents or incidents. \1\ Under no circumstances are aviation  investigations where the portion of the investigation is so delegated to  the FAA by the Board considered to be joint investigations in the sense  of sharing responsibility. These investigations remain NTSB  investigations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ The authority of a representative of the FAA during such  investigations is the same as that of a Board investigator under this  part. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board is the agency charged with fulfilling the obligations  of the United States under Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention on  International Civil Aviation (Eighth Edition, July 1994), and does so  consistent with State Department requirements and in coordination with  that department. Annex 13 contains specific requirements for the  notification, investigation, and reporting of certain incidents and  accidents involving international civil aviation. In the case of an  accident or incident in a foreign state involving civil aircraft of U.S.  registry or manufacture, where the foreign state is a signatory to Annex  13 to the Chicago Convention of the International Civil Aviation  Organization, the state of occurrence is responsible for the  investigation. If the accident or incident occurs in a foreign state not  bound by the provisions of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention, or if the  accident or incident involves a public aircraft (Annex 13 applies only  to civil aircraft), the conduct of the investigation shall be in  consonance with any agreement entered into between the United States and  the foreign state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surface. The Board is responsible for the investigation of:  railroad accidents in which there is a fatality, substantial property  damage, or which involve a passenger train (see part 840 of this  chapter); major marine casualties and marine accidents involving a  public and non-public vessel or involving Coast Guard functions (see  part 850 of this chapter \2\); highway accidents, including railroad  grade-crossing accidents, the investigation of which is selected in  cooperation with the States; and pipeline accidents in which there is a  fatality, significant injury to the environment, or substantial property  damage. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Part 850 also governs the conduct of certain investigations in  which the Board and the Coast Guard participate jointly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other accidents/incidents. The Board is also responsible for the  investigation of an accident/incident that occurs in connection with the  transportation of people or property which, in the judgment of the  Board, is catastrophic, involves problems of a recurring character, or  would otherwise carry out the policy of the Independent Safety Board Act  of 1974. This authority includes, but is not limited to, marine and  boating accidents and incidents not covered by part 850 of this chapter,  and accidents/incidents selected by the Board involving transportation  and/or release of hazardous materials.
