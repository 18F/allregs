The designated representative of a  Phase I unit will be deemed not to violate, during a Phase I calendar  year, the requirement to submit a reduced utilization plan under  paragraph (b)(1) or (4) of this section if the designated representative  complies with the allowance surrender and other requirements of  Sec. Sec. 72.33, 72.91, and 72.92 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special provisions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emissions limitations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any  compensating unit designated under an approved reduced utilization plan  shall become a Phase I unit from January 1 of the calendar year in which  the plan takes effect until January 1 of the year for which the plan is  no longer in effect or is terminated, except that such unit shall not  become subject to the Acid Rain emissions limitations for nitrogen  oxides in Phase I under part 76 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The designated representative of any Phase I unit (including a  unit governed by a reduced utilization plan relying on energy  conservation, improved unit efficiency, sulfur-free generation, or a  compensating unit) shall surrender allowances, and the Administrator  will deduct or return allowances, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of  this section and subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting requirements.
