The filter(s) shall be inserted in the light path perpendicular to the axis of the beam and adjacent to the opening from which the beam of light from the light source emanates, and the recorder response shall be noted. Filters with exposed filtering media should be checked for opacity every six months; all other filters shall be checked every year, using NBS or equivalent reference filters. Deviations in excess of 1 percent of the nominal opacity shall be corrected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The instruments for measuring and recording engine rpm, engine torque, air inlet restrictions, exhaust system backpressure, throttle position, etc., which are used in the test prescribed herein, shall be calibrated in accordance with good engineering practice.
