                                Sec. 81.20  Ballots.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ballots are to be prepared clearly and simply so that it is easy  for the voters to indicate a choice between no more than two  alternatives. For example, if a tribal council or the petitioners  propose to reduce the one-half degree blood quantum required to qualify  for membership but want the voters to decide whether it should be one- fourth or one-eight, it would not be appropriate to put those two  alternatives on the ballot. Doing so, would deny the voters an  opportunity to vote for keeping the one-half degree blood quantum.  Neither would it be appropriate to include all three blood quantum  alternatives. Rather, those proposing the change should decide which  blood quantum is to be submitted to the voters. The ballot in the  Secretarial election would then give the electors the choice of marking  either ``yes'' or ``no.'' A vote against the proposed change would be in  favor of keeping the one-half degree blood quantum in the example.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In preparing ballots for proposed amendments, care should be  taken to ensure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each proposed amendment addresses only a single question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a proposed amendment conflicts with other provisions of the  document being amended, the ballot shall be prepared so that the  question includes all changes in those other directly related provisions  in order to avoid contradictions within the document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When more than one amendment is being submitted to the voters at  a given election, the proposals shall be identified with alphabetical  designations rather than numerical. The first of the several proposals  would be labeled ``Proposed Amendment A,'' the next would be ``Proposed  Amendment B,'' etc. Those amendments that are adopted and approved would  then be assigned consecutive numbers to follow those assigned any  earlier amendments that may have been make to that governing document. A  statement similar to the following shall appear on each of the proposed  amendments and shall be completed following the election:</p><p class="depth3">Having been duly adopted and approved, Proposed Amendment (A,B,C,  etc.) is hereby designated as Amendment No. -- to the (Constitution,  Charter, etc.) of the (name of tribe) Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The election board will supply all ballots. Each ballot shall be  stamped in red ink on its face in the same place:  OFFICIAL BALLOT (Facsimile Signature) CHAIRMAN, ELECTION BOARD</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Should any voter spoil or mutilate a ballot in the course of  voting at a poll, the voter shall destroy it in the presence of the  election officials and the election officials shall then make note of  the destroyed ballot and furnish the voter with another ballot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any spoiled or mutilated absentee ballot may be exchanged for a  new one by returning it to the election board with a request for  another. The board shall honor the request promptly and note the dates  of related actions. No extension of time will be granted for receipt of  exchanged ballots that might not be cast on time.</p>
