                            <p class="depth0">Each track owner with track constructed of CWR shall have in effect  and comply with written procedures which address the installation,  adjustment, maintenance and inspection of CWR, and a training program  for the application of those procedures, which shall be submitted to the  Federal Railroad Administration by March 21, 1999. FRA reviews each plan  for compliance with the following--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures for the installation and adjustment of CWR which  include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designation of a desired rail installation temperature range for  the geographic area in which the CWR is located; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> De-stressing procedures/methods which address proper attainment  of the desired rail installation temperature range when adjusting CWR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rail anchoring or fastening requirements that will provide  sufficient restraint to limit longitudinal rail and crosstie movement to  the extent practical, and specifically addressing CWR rail anchoring or  fastening patterns on bridges, bridge approaches, and at other locations  where possible longitudinal rail and crosstie movement associated with  normally expected train-induced forces, is restricted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures which specifically address maintaining a desired rail  installation temperature range when cutting CWR including rail repairs,  in-track welding, and in conjunction with adjustments made in the area  of tight track, a track buckle, or a pull-apart. Rail repair practices  shall take into consideration existing rail temperature so that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When rail is removed, the length installed shall be determined  by taking into consideration the existing rail temperature and the  desired rail installation temperature range; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under no circumstances should rail be added when the rail  temperature is below that designated by paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, without provisions for later adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures which address the monitoring of CWR in curved track  for inward shifts of alinement toward the center of the curve as a  result of disturbed track.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures which control train speed on CWR track when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance work, track rehabilitation, track construction, or  any other event occurs which disturbs the roadbed or ballast section and  reduces the lateral and/or longitudinal resistance of the track; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (e), the  track owner shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the speed required, and the duration and subsequent  removal of any speed restriction based on the restoration of the  ballast, along with sufficient ballast re-consolidation to stabilize the  track to a level that can accommodate expected train-induced forces.  Ballast re-consolidation can be achieved through either the passage of  train tonnage or mechanical stabilization procedures, or both; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Take into consideration the type of crossties used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures which prescribe when physical track inspections are  to be performed to detect buckling prone conditions in CWR track. At a  minimum, these procedures shall address inspecting track to identify--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Locations where tight or kinky rail conditions are likely to  occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Locations where track work of the nature described in paragraph  (e)(1) of   this section have recently been performed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In formulating the procedures under this paragraph (f), the  track owner shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify the timing of the inspection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specify the appropriate remedial actions to be taken when  buckling prone conditions are found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The track owner shall have in effect a comprehensive training  program for the application of these written CWR procedures, with  provisions for periodic re-training, for those individuals designated  under Sec. 213.305(c) of this part as qualified to supervise the  installation, adjustment, and maintenance of CWR track and to perform  inspections of CWR track.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The track owner shall prescribe recordkeeping requirements  necessary to provide an adequate history of track constructed with CWR.  At a minimum, these records shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rail temperature, location and date of CWR installations. This  record shall be retained for at least one year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A record of any CWR installation or maintenance work that does  not conform with the written procedures. Such record shall include the  location of the rail and be maintained until the CWR is brought into  conformance with such procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjusting/de-stressing means the procedure by which a rail's  temperature is re-adjusted to the desired value. It typically consists  of cutting the rail and removing rail anchoring devices, which provides  for the necessary expansion and contraction, and then re-assembling the  track.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Buckling incident means the formation of a lateral mis-alinement  sufficient in magnitude to constitute a deviation of 5 inches measured  with a 62-foot chord. These normally occur when rail temperatures are  relatively high and are caused by high longitudinal compressive forces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuous welded rail (CWR) means rail that has been welded  together into lengths exceeding 400 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Desired rail installation temperature range means the rail  temperature range, within a specific geographical area, at which forces  in CWR should not cause a buckling incident in extreme heat, or a pull- apart during extreme cold weather.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disturbed track means the disturbance of the roadbed or ballast  section, as a result of track maintenance or any other event, which  reduces the lateral or longitudinal resistance of the track, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Mechanical stabilization means a type of procedure used to  restore track resistance to disturbed track following certain  maintenance operations. This procedure may incorporate dynamic track  stabilizers or ballast consolidators, which are units of work equipment  that are used as a substitute for the stabilization action provided by  the passage of tonnage trains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Rail anchors means those devices which are attached to the rail  and bear against the side of the crosstie to control longitudinal rail  movement. Certain types of rail fasteners also act as rail anchors and  control longitudinal rail movement by exerting a downward clamping force  on the upper surface of the rail base.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Rail temperature means the temperature of the rail, measured  with a rail thermometer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Tight/kinky rail means CWR which exhibits minute alinement  irregularities which indicate that the rail is in a considerable amount  of compression.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Train-induced forces means the vertical, longitudinal, and  lateral dynamic forces which are generated during train movement and  which can contribute to the buckling potential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Track lateral resistance means the resistance provided to the  rail/crosstie structure against lateral displacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Track longitudinal resistance means the resistance provided by  the rail anchors/rail fasteners and the ballast section to the rail/ crosstie structure against longitudinal displacement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Track owners shall revise their CWR plans to include provisions  for the inspection of joint bars in accordance with Secs. 213.119(g) and  (i)(3).
