                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for determinations. Determinations made by the State  mental health or intellectual disability authority as to whether NF  level of services and specialized services are needed must be based on  an evaluation of data   concerning the individual, as specified in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of determinations. Determinations may be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance group determinations, in accordance with this section,  by category that take into account that certain diagnoses, levels of  severity of illness, or need for a particular service clearly indicate  that admission to or residence in a NF is normally needed, or that the  provision of specialized services is not normally needed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individualized determinations based on more extensive  individualized evaluations as required in Sec. 483.132, Sec. 483.134,  or Sec. 483.136 (or, in the case of an individual having both IID and  MI, Sec. Sec. 483.134 and 483.136).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c))</em>.  Sources of existing data on the individual that could form the basis for  applying a categorical determination by the State authorities would be  hospital records, physician's evaluations, election of hospice status,  records of community mental health centers or community intellectual  disability or developmental disability providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples of categories. Examples of categories for which the  State mental health or intellectual disability authority may make an  advance group determination that NF services are needed are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Convalescent care from an acute physical illness which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Required hospitalization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Does not meet all the criteria for an exempt hospital  discharge, which is not subject to preadmission screening, as specified  in Sec. 483.106(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Terminal illness, as defined for hospice purposes in Sec. 418.3  of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Severe physical illnesses such as coma, ventilator dependence,  functioning at a brain stem level, or diagnoses such as chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's  disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and congestive heart failure  which result in a level of impairment so severe that the individual  could not be expected to benefit from specialized services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provisional admissions pending further assessment in cases of  delirium where an accurate diagnosis cannot be made until the delirium  clears;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provisional admissions pending further assessment in emergency  situations requiring protective services, with placement in a nursing  facility not to exceed 7 days; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Very brief and finite stays of up to a fixed number of days to  provide respite to in-home caregivers to whom the individual with MI or  IID is expected to return following the brief NF stay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time limits. The State may specify time limits for categorical  determinations that NF services are needed and in the case of paragraphs  (d)(4), (5) and (6) of this section, must specify a time limit which is  appropriate for provisional admissions pending further assessment and  for emergency situations and respite care. If an individual is later  determined to need a longer stay than the State's limit allows, the  individual must be subjected to an annual resident review before  continuation of the stay may be permitted and payment made for days of  NF care beyond the State's time limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The State mental health and intellectual disability authorities  may make categorical determinations that specialized services are not  needed in the provisional, emergency and respite admission situations  identified in Sec. 483.130(d)(4)-(6). In all other cases, except for  Sec. 483.130(h), a determination that specialized services are not  needed must be based on a more extensive individualized evaluation under  Sec. 483.134 or Sec. 483.136.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Categorical determinations: No positive specialized treatment  determinations. The State mental health and intellectual disability  authorities must not make categorical determinations that specialized  services are needed. Such a determination must be based on a more  extensive individualized evaluation   under Sec. 483.134 or Sec. 483.136 to determine the exact nature of  the specialized services that are needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Categorical determinations: Dementia and IID. The State  intellectual disability authority may make categorical determinations  that individuals with dementia, which exists in combination with  intellectual disability or a related condition, do not need specialized  services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If a State mental health or intellectual disability authority  determines NF needs by category, it may not waive the specialized  services determination. The appropriate State authority must also  determine whether specialized services are needed either by category (if  permitted) or by individualized evaluations, as specified in Sec.  483.134 or Sec. 483.136.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Recording determinations. All determinations made by the State  mental health and intellectual disability authority, regardless of how  they are arrived at, must be recorded in the individual's record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notice of determination. The State mental health or intellectual  disability authority must notify in writing the following entities of a  determination made under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The evaluated individual and his or her legal representative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The admitting or retaining NF;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The individual or resident's attending physician; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The discharging hospital, unless the individual is exempt from  preadmission screening as provided for at Sec. 483.106(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Contents of notice. Each notice of the determination made by the  State mental health or intellectual disability authority must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether a NF level of services is needed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether specialized services are needed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The placement options that are available to the individual  consistent with these determinations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The rights of the individual to appeal the determination under  subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Placement options. Except as otherwise may be provided in an  alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the  Act, the placement options and the required State actions are as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Can be admitted to a NF. Any applicant for admission to a NF who  has MI or IID and who requires the level of services provided by a NF,  regardless of whether specialized services are also needed, may be  admitted to a NF, if the placement is appropriate, as determined in  Sec. 483.126. If specialized services are also needed, the State is  responsible for providing or arranging for the provision of the  specialized services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cannot be admitted to a NF. Any applicant for admission to a NF  who has MI or IID and who does not require the level of services  provided by a NF, regardless of whether specialized services are also  needed, is inappropriate for NF placement and must not be admitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Can be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF.  Any NF resident with MI or IID who requires the level of services  provided by a NF, regardless of the length of his or her stay or the  need for specialized services, can continue to reside in the NF, if the  placement is appropriate, as determined in Sec. 483.126.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> May choose to remain in the NF even though the placement would  otherwise be inappropriate. Any NF resident with MI or IID who does not  require the level of services provided by a NF but does require  specialized services and who has continuously resided in a NF for at  least 30 consecutive months before the date of determination may choose  to continue to reside in the facility or to receive covered services in  an alternative appropriate institutional or noninstitutional setting.  Wherever the resident chooses to reside, the State must meet his or her  specialized services needs. The determination notice must provide  information concerning how, when, and by whom the various placement  options available to the resident will be fully explained to the  resident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cannot be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF  and must be discharged (short-term residents). Any NF resident with MI  or IID who does not require the level of services provided by a NF but  does require specialized services and who has resided in a NF   for less than 30 consecutive months must be discharged in accordance  with Sec. 483.12(a) to an appropriate setting where the State must  provide specialized services. The determination notice must provide  information on how, when, and by whom the resident will be advised of  discharge arrangements and of his/her appeal rights under both PASARR  and discharge provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cannot be considered appropriate for continued placement in a NF  and must be discharged (short or long-term residents). Any NF resident  with MI or IID who does not require the level of services provided by a  NF and does not require specialized services regardless of his or her  length of stay, must be discharged in accordance with Sec. 483.12(a).  The determination notice must provide information on how, when, and by  whom the resident will be advised of discharge arrangements and of his  or her appeal rights under both PASARR and discharge provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Specialized services needed in a NF. If a determination is made  to admit or allow to remain in a NF any individual who requires  specialized services, the determination must be supported by assurances  that the specialized services that are needed can and will be provided  or arranged for by the State while the individual resides in the NF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Record retention. The State PASARR system must maintain records  of evaluations and determinations, regardless of whether they are  performed categorically or individually, in order to support its  determinations and actions and to protect the appeal rights of  individuals subjected to PASARR; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Tracking system. The State PASARR system must establish and  maintain a tracking system for all individuals with MI or IID in NFs to  ensure that appeals and future reviews are performed in accordance with  this subpart and subpart E.
