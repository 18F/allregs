                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The label of a cosmetic in package form shall bear a declaration  of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in terms of  weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count  and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure  if the cosmetic is liquid or in terms of weight if the cosmetic is  solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid. If there  is a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of  declaring the net quantity of a cosmetic by numerical count, linear  measure, or measure of area, such respective term may be used. If there  is a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of  declaring the contents of a liquid cosmetic by weight, or a solid,  semisolid, or viscous cosmetic by fluid measure, it may be used.  Whenever the Commissioner determines for a specific packaged cosmetic  that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by  weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of these does not  facilitate value comparisons by consumers, he shall by regulation  designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such cosmetic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and  ounce. Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon  of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid-ounce subdivisions  thereof and shall express the volume at 68 [deg]F. (20 [deg]C.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count,  linear measure, or measure of area does not give accurate information as  to the quantity of cosmetic in the package, it shall be augmented by  such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units or  the total weight or measure of the cosmetic as will give such  information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A  common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths,  sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly  established, general consumer usage and trade custom of employing  different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a  particular commodity they may be employed. A common fraction shall be  reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out  to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an  ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does  not include such fractions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel  of the label; with respect to packages bearing alternate principal  display panels, it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel:  Provided, That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The principal display panel of a cosmetic marketed in a  ``boudoir-type'' container including decorative cosmetic containers of  the ``cartridge,'' ``pill box,'' ``compact,'' or ``pencil'' variety, and  those with a capacity of one-fourth ounce or less, may be considered to  be a tear-away tag or tape affixed to the decorative container and  bearing the mandatory label information as required by this part, but  the type size of the net quantity of contents statement shall be  governed by the dimensions of the decorative container; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The principal display panel of a cosmetic marketed on a display  card to which the immediate container is affixed may be considered to be  the display panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity of  content statement is governed by the dimensions of the display card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal  display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the  height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed  label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at  least a space equal to twice the width of the letter ``N'' of the style  of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed  label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It  shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or  count (such as ``giant pint'' and ``full quart'') that tends to   exaggerate the amount of the cosmetic in the container. It shall be  placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of  the area of the label panel in line generally parallel to the base on  which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: Provided,  That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches  or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of  the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net  quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a cosmetic that is marketed with both outer and  inner retail containers bearing the mandatory label information required  by this part, and the inner container is not intended to be sold  separately, the net quantity of contents placement requirement of this  section applicable to such inner containers is waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of cosmetic  in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed  therewith: Provided, That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of cosmetics packed in containers designed to  deliver the cosmetic under pressure, the declaration shall state the net  quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for  use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included  in the net quantity declaration; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a package which contains the integral components  making up a complete kit, and which is designed to deliver the  components in the manner of an application (for example, a home  permanent wave kit), the declaration may state the net quantity of the  contents in nondeceptive terms of the number of applications available  in the kit when the instructions for use as shown on the container are  followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible  boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout,  color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except  that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass  or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so  formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility  shall include the specifications that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a  differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is  wide).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When  upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower  case letter ``o'' or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum  standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one- half the minimum height standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size  established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel  of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially  the same size by complying with the following type specifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages the  principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages the  principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more  than 25 square inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages the  principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not  more than 100 square inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this  section shall be increased by one-sixteenth of an inch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and  labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in  the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as  appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or  decimal fractions of the pint or quart (as set forth in paragraphs  (m)(3) and (4) of this section). Net weight or fluid measure of less  than 1 ounce shall be expressed in common or decimal fractions of the  respective ounce and not in drams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term ``net  weight'' shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in  terms of weight. Use of the terms ``net'' or ``net contents'' in terms  of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to  distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of  terms; for example, ``Net wt. 6 oz.'' or ``6 oz. net wt.'' and ``Net  contents 6 fl. oz.'' or ``6 fl. oz.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled  in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed  in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or  common or decimal fractions of the pound; in the case of fluid measure,  it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons, followed by  common or decimal fractions of a gallon or by the next smaller whole  unit or units (quarts or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms  of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (as  set forth in paragraph (m)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Examples: (1) A declaration of 1\1/2\ pounds weight shall be  expressed as ``Net wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.)'', ``Net wt. 24 oz. (1\1/2\  lb.)'', or ``Net wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lb.)''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be  expressed as ``Net wt. 12 oz.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as  ``Net contents 32 fl. oz. (1 qt.)''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A declaration of 1\3/4\ quarts liquid measure shall be expressed  as ``Net contents 56 fl. oz. (1 qt. 1\1/2\ pt.)'' or ``Net contents 56  fl. oz. (1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz.)'' but not in terms of quart and ounce such  as ``Net content 56 fl. oz. (1 qt. 24 oz.)''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A declaration of 2\1/2\ gallons liquid measure shall be  expressed in the alternative as ``Net contents 2 gal. 2 qt.'' and not as  ``2 gal. 4 pt.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may  be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):  weight wt. square sq. fluid fl. yard yd. feet or foot ft. inch in. gallon gal. quart qt. pint pt. ounce oz. pound lb.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> On packages labeled in terms of linear measure, the declaration  shall be expressed both in terms of inches and, if applicable (1 foot or  more), the largest whole units (yards, yards and feet, feet). The  declaration in terms of the largest whole units shall be in parentheses  following the declaration in terms of inches and any remainder shall be  in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot or yard.  Examples are ``86 inches (2 yd. 1 ft. 2 inches)'', ``90 inches (2\1/2\  yd.)'', ``30 inches (2.5 ft.)'', etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> On packages labeled in terms of area measure, the declaration  shall be expressed in terms of square inches and, if applicable (1  square foot or more), the largest whole square unit (square yards,  square yards and square feet, square feet). The declaration in terms of  the largest whole units shall be in parentheses following the  declaration in terms of square inches and any remainder shall be in  terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square foot  or square yard; for example, ``158 sq. inches (1 sq. ft. 14 sq.  inches)'', etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements  at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in  nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents, provided that such  supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include  any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends   to exaggerate the amount of the cosmetic contained in the package; for  example, ``giant pint'' and ``full quart.'' Dual or combination  declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs  (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net  weight plus numerical count) are not regarded as supplemental net  quantity statements and shall be located on the principal display panel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of  the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an  accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the  metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal  display panel or on other panels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an  accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package.  Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the  course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in  good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated  quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.</p>
