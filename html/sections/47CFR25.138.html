Certification that the on-site testing has been satisfactorily performed must be included with the certification filed pursuant to Sec. 25.133(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protection of downlink reception from adjacent satellite interference is based on either the antenna performance specified in Sec. 25.209 (a) and (b), or the actual receiving earth station antenna performance, if actual performance provides greater isolation from adjacent satellite interference. For purposes of ensuring the correct level of protection, the applicant must provide, for each earth station antenna type, antenna performance plots for the 18.3-18.8 GHz and 19.7-20.2 GHz bands in the format prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The holder of a blanket license pursuant to this section will be responsible for operation of any transceiver to receive service provided by that licensee or provided by another party with the blanket licensee's consent.
