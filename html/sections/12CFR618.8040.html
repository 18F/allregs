                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Farm Credit System banks (excluding banks for cooperatives)  (hereinafter banks) and associations may sell to their members and  borrowers, on an optional basis, credit or term life and credit  disability insurance appropriate to protect the loan commitment in the  event of death or disability of the debtors. The sale of other insurance  necessary to protect a member's or borrower's farm or aquatic unit is   permitted, but limited to hail and multiple-peril crop insurance, title  insurance, and insurance necessary to protect the facilities and  equipment of aquatic members and borrowers. A member or borrower shall  have the option, without coercion from the bank or association, to  accept or reject such insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bank and association board policies governing the provision of  member insurance programs shall be established within the following  general guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A System bank or association may provide credit or term-life or  credit-disability insurance only to persons who have a loan or lease  with any System bank or association, without regard to whether such  institution is the provider. Term-life insurance coverage may continue  after the loan has been repaid or the lease terminated, provided the  member can reasonably be expected to borrow again within 2 years, and  provided the continuation of insurance is not contrary to state law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A debtor-creditor relationship is not required for the sale of  other insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as  purchasers are members of a System bank or association. For the purposes  of this section, ``member'' means someone eligible to borrow who is a  stockholder or participation certificate holder and who acquired stock  or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for investment purposes,  or to qualify for other services of the association or bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In making insurance available through private insurers, each  bank shall approve the programs of more than two insurers for each type  of insurance offered in the bank's chartered territory, provided that  more than two insurers for each type of insurance have proposed programs  to the bank that will, in all likelihood, have long-term viability, and  meet the requirements of Sec. 618.8040(b)(4)(i) of this section. The  banks shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to attract more than  two qualified insurers for each insurance program offered to borrowers  in all States of the bank's chartered territory. Where the bank is  unable to approve more than two insurers, the bank shall document its  efforts to attract additional qualified insurers for the affected  insurance program and State. The banks may provide comparative  information relating to costs and quality of approved programs and the  financial condition of approved companies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Member insurance services may be offered only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The insurance program has been approved by the bank or  association from among eligible programs made available to it by  insurers--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Meeting reasonable financial and quality of service standards  prescribed by the bank; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Licensed under State law to do business in the State(s) in which  the insurance is offered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bank or association has the capacity to render authorized  insurance services in an effective and efficient manner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There exists the probability that the service will generate  sufficient revenue to cover all costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Rendering the insurance service will not have an adverse effect  on the credit or other operations of the bank or association; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In making insurance available through approved insurers, the  board of directors of the bank or association shall make a reasonable  and good faith effort to select and offer at least two approved insurers  for each type of insurance made available to the members and borrowers.  In the event that the bank or association has selected less than two  insurers for any insurance program, such bank or association shall  document the reasons why it is unable to offer members and borrowers  additional insurers for the affected insurance program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All costs to members and borrowers for insurance services  provided shall be disclosed separately from interest charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Bank and association personnel shall not benefit from insurance  sales by receipt of commissions or gifts from underwriting insurance  companies. However, employees may participate in an incentive plan under  which incentive compensation is provided based on the sale of insurance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In any single year, for all employees except full-time insurance  personnel or full-time supervisors or managers of insurance departments,  incentive compensation attributable to sales of all types of insurance  cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the recipient's  annual base salary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In any single year, for full-time insurance personnel and full- time supervisors and managers of insurance departments, incentive  compensation for sales of credit life and similar types of insurance  (i.e. insurance that pays on a loan or mortgage upon the death or  disability of the debtor) cannot exceed an amount equivalent to 5  percent of the recipient's annual base salary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No incentive compensation limit applies to sales of other  insurance (crop, title, etc.) by full-time insurance personnel or full- time supervisors or managers of insurance departments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Term insurance may be written for the amount of coverage desired  by the member or borrower, but in no case may the amount of term  insurance, credit life insurance, or a combination of the two with an  institution of the System, be in excess of total loan commitments to the  member or borrower by the institution writing the insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The banks may, only by agreement with an insurer, offer services  traditionally furnished by insurers to the Farm Credit System. This  shall include master marketers when considering the sale of Federal crop  insurance. The banks shall not underwrite insurance, adjust claim  payments or settlements, or train and school or service adjustors or  insurance agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly, condition  the extension of credit or provision of other service on the purchase of  insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association. At the time  insurance sold or endorsed by a bank or association is offered to a  member or borrower, a bank or association shall present a written notice  that the service is optional. The notice shall be in prominent type and  separately signed by the member or borrower. The bank or association  shall explain to the member or borrower that purchase of insurance from  the association is optional and that the member or borrower will not be  discriminated against for obtaining the insurance elsewhere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> No bank or association shall, directly or indirectly,  discriminate in any manner against any agent, broker, or insurer that is  not affiliated with such bank or association, or against any party who  purchases insurance through any such nonaffiliated insurance agent,  broker, or insurer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Bank supervision shall ensure that insurance services offered  by approved insurers consistently provide members or borrowers with a  high quality and cost-effective service as prescribed by policies of the  bank's board of directors, but such supervision shall be without any  coercion or suasion from any bank in favor of any agent or insurer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Records must be maintained by banks and associations in  sufficient detail to facilitate the review and supervision required  herein.
