                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> End-of-year and final reports must indicate the engine family,  the engine class, the actual production volume, the values required to  calculate credits as given in Sec. 90.207, and the number of credits  generated/required. Manufacturers must also submit how and where credit  surpluses were dispersed (or are to be banked) and/or how and through  what means credit deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to  credit trading must be included or supplied by the broker, if  applicable. The report must include a calculation of credit balances to  show that the credit summation for all engines is equal to or greater  than zero (or less than zero in cases of negative credit balances as  permitted in Sec. 90.207(c)). For model year 2005 and later, the report  must include a calculation of the production weighted average  HC+NOX (including NMHC+NOX) FEL for Class II  engine families to show compliance with the provisions of  Sec. 90.203(g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The calculation of eligible production for end-of-year and final  reports must be based on engines produced for the United States market,  excluding engines which are subject to state emission standards pursuant  to a waiver granted by EPA under section 209(e) of the Act. Upon advance  written request, the Administrator will consider other methods to track  engines for credit calculation purposes that provide high levels of  confidence that eligible production or sales are accurately counted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the  end of the model year to: Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group  (6403-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, final reports  must be submitted within 270 days of the end of the model year to:  Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group (6403-J), U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>  of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A manufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to  submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90  days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such  reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits  pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year  report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected in the  final report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error  occurred on an end-of-year or final report previously submitted to EPA  under this   section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations must be  recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as provided  in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit balances may  be adjusted by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's  favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the  manufacturer discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the  model year, EPA shall restore the credits for use by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For 2007 and later model years, include in your end-of-year and  final reports an accounting to show a separate balance of emission  credits for handheld and nonhandheld engines. Use your best judgment to  differentiate your current balance of banked credits for handheld and  nonhandheld engines. You may exchange handheld and nonhandheld credits  to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this part 90.  However, emission credits you generate for banking under this part 90  will be restricted for engines subject to the requirements of 40 CFR  part 1054.
