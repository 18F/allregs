                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contracting officers shall prepare invitations for bids and contracts using the uniform contract format outlined in Table 14-1 to the maximum practicable extent. The use of the format facilitates preparation of the solicitation and contract as well as reference to, and use of, those documents by bidders and contractors. It need not be used for acquisition of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction (see part 36).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shipbuilding (including design, construction, and conversion), ship overhaul, and ship repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsistence items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supplies or services requiring special contract forms prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that are inconsistent with the uniform contract format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment acquisitions that use the simplified contract format (see 14.201-9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information suitable for inclusion in invitations for bids under the uniform contract format shall also be included in invitations for bids not subject to that format if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Solicitations to which the uniform contract format applies shall include Parts I, II, III, and IV. If any section of the uniform contract format does not apply, the contracting officer should so mark that section in the solicitation. Upon award, the contracting officer shall not physically include Part IV in the resulting contract, but shall retain it in the contract file. (See 4.1201(c).) Award by acceptance of a bid on the award portion of Standard Form 33, Solicitation Offer and Award (SF 33), Standard Form 26, Award/Contract (SF 26), or Standard Form 1447, Solicitation/Contract (SF 1447), incorporates Section K, Representations, certifications, and other statements of bidders, in the resultant contract even though not physically attached. The representations and certifications shall be incorporated by reference in the contract by using 52.204-19 (see 4.1202(b)) or for acquisitions of commercial items see 52.212-4(v).</p><p class="depth2">Table 14-1</p><p class="depth2">Uniform Contract Format------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Section                               Title------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Part I--The Schedule</p><p class="depth2">A                              Solicitation/contract formB                              Supplies or services and pricesC                              Description/specificationsD                              Packaging and markingE                              Inspection and acceptanceF                              Deliveries or performanceG                              Contract administration dataH                              Special contract requirements</p><p class="depth2">Part II--Contract Clauses</p><p class="depth2">I                              Contract clauses</p><p class="depth2">Part III--List of Documents, Exhibits, and Other Attachments</p><p class="depth2">J                              List of documents, exhibits, and other</p><p class="depth2">attachments</p><p class="depth2">Part IV--Representations and Instructions</p><p class="depth2">K                              Representations, certifications, and</p><p class="depth2">other statements of biddersL                              Instructions, conditions, and notices to</p><p class="depth2">biddersM                              Evaluation factors for award------------------------------------------------------------------------
