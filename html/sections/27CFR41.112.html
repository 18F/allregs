                            <p class="depth0">The internal revenue taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), with respect to tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and shipped to the United States on computation of tax under the provisions of this subpart shall be paid on the basis of a semimonthly tax return. The bonded manufacturer of such products shall prepare TTB Form 5000.25 in duplicate, and file the original with the appropriate TTB officer, and maintain one copy for the file for each semimonthly return period. The bonded manufacturer shall execute the return, TTB Form 5000.25, under the penalties of perjury. He shall file a return for each return period at the time specified in Sec. 41.114, regardless of whether tax is due for that return period. However, where the appropriate TTB officer, grants specific authorization, the bonded manufacturer need not file a tax return during the term of such authorization for any period in which tax

liability was not incurred under the provisions of this subpart.
