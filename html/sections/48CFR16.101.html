                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A wide selection of contract types is available to the  Government and contractors in order to provide needed flexibility in  acquiring the large variety and volume of supplies and services required  by agencies. Contract types vary according to (1) the degree and timing  of the responsibility assumed by the contractor for the costs of  performance and (2) the amount and nature of the profit incentive  offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards  or goals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contract types are grouped into two broad categories: fixed- price contracts (see subpart 16.2) and cost-reimbursement contracts (see  subpart 16.3). The specific contract types range from firm-fixed-price,  in which the contractor has full responsibility for the performance  costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which  the contractor has minimal responsibility for the performance costs and  the negotiated fee (profit) is fixed. In between are the various  incentive contracts (see subpart 16.4), in which the contractor's  responsibility for the performance costs and the profit or fee  incentives offered are tailored to the uncertainties involved in  contract performance.</p>
