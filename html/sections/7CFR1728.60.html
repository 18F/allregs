Those items of material or equipment accepted by Technical Standards Committee ``A'' or ``B,'' with the exception of technically accepted nondomestic items, will be listed in the List of Materials. Items which do not qualify as domestic products may be accepted on a technical basis only (technical acceptance) for a period of one year as provided in Sec. 1728.30(c)(1) and will not be included in the List of Materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Publishing and Revisions. RUS will reissue the List of Materials every year, dated July, and issue supplements, if needed, dated October, January, and April of every year. An RUS office copy, which is the official current copy, of the List of Materials, will be updated every time changes are made by the Technical Standards Committees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dual Listings. RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees, will accept for listing only one item of a particular type of material or equipment for each manufacturer. If a manufacturer submits an item to perform the identical function of a listed item, RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees, may accept that item and remove the one previously listed. RUS will list only new items of material and equipment in the List of Materials. Used items will not be considered for listing.
