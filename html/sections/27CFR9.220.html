For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The three United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Asti Quadrangle--California, 1998;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cloverdale Quadrangle--California, 1960, photoinspected 1975; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Highland Springs Quadrangle--California, 1959, photorevised 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary.
