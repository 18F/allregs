EPA has the authority to establish or modify data  needs for individual pesticide chemicals. The actual data required may  be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and  properties, characteristics, or effects of specific pesticide products  under review. The Agency encourages each applicant to consult with EPA  to discuss the data requirements particular to its product prior to and  during the registration process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Agency cautions applicants that the data routinely required  in this part may not be sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate the  potential of the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or  the environment. EPA may require the submission of additional data or  information beyond that specified in this part if such data or  information are needed to appropriately evaluate a pesticide product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part will be updated as needed to reflect evolving program  needs and advances in science.</p>
