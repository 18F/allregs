A computer program listing for the purpose of this  section is defined as a printout that lists in appropriate sequence the  instructions, routines, and other contents of a program for a computer.  The program listing may be either in machine or machine-independent  (object or source) language which will cause a computer to perform a  desired procedure or task such as solve a problem, regulate the flow of  work in a computer, or control or monitor events. Computer program  listings may be submitted in patent applications as set forth in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Material which will be printed in the patent: If the computer  program listing is contained in 300 lines or fewer, with each line of 72  characters or fewer, it may be submitted either as drawings or as part  of the specification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drawings. If the listing is submitted as drawings, it must be  submitted in the manner and complying with the requirements for drawings  as provided in Sec.  1.84.

A compact disc containing   such a computer program listing is to be referred to as a ``computer  program listing appendix.'' The ``computer program listing appendix''  will not be part of the printed patent. The specification must include a  reference to the ``computer program listing appendix'' at the location  indicated in Sec.  1.77(b)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiple computer program listings for a single application may  be placed on a single compact disc. Multiple compact discs may be  submitted for a single application if necessary. A separate compact disc  is required for each application containing a computer program listing  that must be submitted on a ``computer program listing appendix.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ``computer program listing appendix'' must be submitted on a  compact disc that complies with Sec.  1.52(e) and the following  specifications (no other format shall be allowed):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Computer Compatibility: IBM PC/XT/AT, or compatibles, or Apple  Macintosh;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operating System Compatibility: MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Unix, or  Macintosh;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Line Terminator: ASCII Carriage Return plus ASCII Line Feed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Control Codes: the data must not be dependent on control  characters or codes which are not defined in the ASCII character set;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Compression: uncompressed data.
