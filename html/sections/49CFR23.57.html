                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You cannot be penalized, or treated by the Department as being  in noncompliance with this part, simply because your ACDBE participation  falls short of your overall goals. You can be penalized or treated as  being in noncompliance only if you have failed to administer your ACDBE  program in good faith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the awards and commitments shown on your Uniform Report of  ACDBE Participation (found in Appendix A to this Part) at the end of any  fiscal year are less than the overall goal applicable to that fiscal  year, you must do the following in order to be regarded by the  Department as implementing your ACDBE program in good faith:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Analyze in detail the reasons for the difference between the  overall goal and your awards and commitments in that fiscal year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish specific steps and milestones to correct the problems  you have identified in your analysis and to enable you to meet fully  your goal for the new fiscal year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are a CORE 30 airport or other airport designated by  the FAA, you must submit, within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year,  the analysis and corrective actions developed under paragraphs (b)(1)  and (2) of this section to the FAA for approval. If the FAA approves the  report, you will be regarded as complying with the requirements of this  section for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As an airport not meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(3)(i)  of this section, you must retain analysis and corrective actions in your  records for three years and make it available to the FAA, on request,  for their review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The FAA may impose conditions on the recipient as part of its  approval of the recipient's analysis and corrective actions including,  but not limited to, modifications to your overall goal methodology,  changes in your race-conscious/race-neutral split, or the introduction  of additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may be regarded as being in noncompliance with this part,  and   therefore subject to the remedies in Sec. 23.11 of this part and other  applicable regulations, for failing to implement your ACDBE program in  good faith if any of the following things occur:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You do not submit your analysis and corrective actions to FAA in  a timely manner as required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FAA disapproves your analysis or corrective actions; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You do not fully implement:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The corrective actions to which you have committed, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Conditions that FAA has imposed following review of your  analysis and corrective actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If information coming to the attention of FAA demonstrates that  current trends make it unlikely that you, as an airport, will achieve  ACDBE awards and commitments that would be necessary to allow you to  meet your overall goal at the end of the fiscal year, FAA may require  you to make further good faith efforts, such as modifying your race- conscious/race-neutral split or introducing additional race-neutral or  race-conscious measures for the remainder of the fiscal year.
