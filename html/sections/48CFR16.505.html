                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em> and (11), and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual orders shall clearly describe all services to be  performed or supplies to be delivered so the full cost or price for the  performance of the work can be established when the order is placed.  Orders shall be within the scope, issued within the period of  performance, and be within the maximum value of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Performance-based acquisition methods must be used to the  maximum extent practicable, if the contract or order is for services  (see 37.102(a) and Subpart 37.6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The following requirements apply when procuring items peculiar  to one manufacturer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer must justify restricting consideration  to an item peculiar to one manufacturer (e.g., a particular brand-name,  product, or a feature of a product that is peculiar to one  manufacturer). A brand-name item, even if available on more than one  contract, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. Brand-name  specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand-name,  product, or feature is essential to the Government's requirements and  market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products  lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to  meet, the agency's needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, (B), and (C) of this section, modified to  show the brand-name justification. A justification is required unless a  justification covering the requirements in the order was previously  approved for the contract in accordance with 6.302-1(c) or unless the  base contract is a single-award contract awarded under full and open  competition. Justifications for the use of brand-name specifications  must be completed and approved at the time the requirement for a brand- name is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For an order in excess of $30,000, the contracting officer  shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Post the justification and supporting documentation on the  agency Web site used (if any) to solicit offers for orders under the  contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide the justification and supporting documentation along  with the solicitation to all contract awardees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The justifications for brand-name acquisitions may apply to the  portion of the acquisition requiring the brand-name item. If the  justification is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is  brand-name, then it should so state; the approval level requirements  will then only apply to that portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requirements in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section do  not apply when disclosure would compromise the national security (e.g.,  would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other  security risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When acquiring information technology and related services,  consider the use of modular contracting to reduce program risk (see  39.103(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Orders may be placed by using any medium specified in the  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Orders placed under indefinite-delivery contracts must contain  the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Date of order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contract number and order number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For supplies and services, contract item number and  description, quantity, and unit price or estimated cost or fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Delivery or performance schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Place of delivery or performance (including consignee).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any packaging, packing, and shipping instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Accounting and appropriation data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Method of payment and payment office, if not specified in the  contract (see 32.1110(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Orders placed under a task-order contract or delivery-order  contract awarded by another agency (i.e., a Governmentwide acquisition  contract, or multi-agency contract)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are not exempt from the development of acquisition plans (see  subpart 7.1), and an information technology acquisition strategy (see  part 39);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May not be used to circumvent conditions and limitations  imposed on the use of funds (e.g., 31 U.S.C. 1501(a)(1)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Must comply with all FAR requirements for a bundled contract  when the order meets the definition of ``bundled contract'' (see  2.101(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> In accordance with section 1427(b) of Public Law 108-136 (40  U.S.C. 1103 note), orders placed under multi-agency contracts for  services that substantially or to a dominant extent specify performance  of architect-engineer services, as defined in 2.101, shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be awarded using the procedures at Subpart 36.6; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require the direct supervision of a professional architect or  engineer licensed, registered or certified in the State, Federal  District, or outlying area, in which the services are to be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No protest under subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection  with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order  contract or delivery-order contract, except for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope,  period, or maximum value of the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A protest of an order valued in excess of $10 million. Protests  of orders in excess of $10 million may only be filed with the Government  Accountability Office, in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The authority to protest the placement of an order under  (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for  agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d)  and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an  order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA,  and the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Publicize orders funded in whole or in part by the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.

The contracting  officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting  officers may use streamlined procedures, including oral   presentations. If the order does not exceed the simplified acquisition  threshold, the contracting officer need not contact each of the multiple  awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee if the  contracting officer has information available to ensure that each  awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.  The competition requirements in part 6 and the policies in subpart 15.3  do not apply to the ordering process. However, the contracting officer  must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Develop placement procedures that will provide each awardee a  fair opportunity to be considered for each order and that reflect the  requirement and other aspects of the contracting environment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Not use any method (such as allocation or designation of any  preferred awardee) that would not result in fair consideration being  given to all awardees prior to placing each order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tailor the procedures to each acquisition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Include the procedures in the solicitation and the contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Consider price or cost under each order as one of the factors in  the selection decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold shall be  placed on a competitive basis in accordance with paragraph  (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, unless supported by a written  determination that one of the circumstances described at 16.505(b)(2)(i)  applies to the order and the requirement is waived on the basis of a  justification that is prepared in accordance with 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contracting officer shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide a fair notice of the intent to make a purchase,  including a clear description of the supplies to be delivered or the  services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be  made to all contractors offering the required supplies or services under  the multiple-award contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Afford all contractors responding to the notice a fair  opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Orders exceeding $5.5 million. For task or delivery orders in  excess of $5.5 million, the requirement to provide all awardees a fair  opportunity to be considered for each order shall include, at a  minimum--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A notice of the task or delivery order that includes a clear  statement of the agency's requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A reasonable response period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors, including  cost or price, that the agency expects to consider in evaluating  proposals, and their relative importance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where award is made on a best value basis, a written statement  documenting the basis for award and the relative importance of quality  and price or cost factors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An opportunity for a postaward debriefing in accordance with  paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The contracting officer should consider the following when  developing the procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> Past performance on earlier orders under the contract,  including quality, timeliness and cost control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum order requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The amount of time contractors need to make informed business  decisions on whether to respond to potential orders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether contractors could be encouraged to respond to potential  orders by outreach efforts to promote exchanges of information, such  as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seeking comments from two or more contractors on draft  statements of work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Using a multiphased approach when effort required to respond to  a potential order may be resource intensive (e.g., requirements are  complex or need continued development), where all contractors are  initially considered on price considerations (e.g., rough estimates),  and other considerations as appropriate (e.g., proposed conceptual  approach, past performance). The contractors most likely to submit the  highest value solutions are then selected for one-on-one sessions with  the Government to increase their understanding of the requirements,  provide   suggestions for refining requirements, and discuss risk reduction  measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Formal evaluation plans or scoring of quotes or offers are not  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions to the fair opportunity process. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting  officer shall give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for  a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,500 unless one of the  following statutory exceptions applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that  providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or  services required at the level of quality required because the supplies  or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest  of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order  already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given  a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum  guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a  statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from  a specified source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (15 U.S.C.  644(r)), contracting officers may, at their discretion, set aside orders  for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3).

Contracting officers shall also be guided by the exemptions to  disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act (5  U.S.C. 552) and the prohibitions against disclosure in 24.202 in  determining whether other data should be removed. Although the submitter  notice process set out in Executive Order 12600 ``Predisclosure  Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information'' does  not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the  contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the  information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary  data before making the justification available for public inspection,  redacted as necessary.
