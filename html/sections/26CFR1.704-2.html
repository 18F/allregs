class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of and  allocations of nonrecourse deductions. Allocations of losses,  deductions, or section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures attributable to  partnership nonrecourse liabilities (``nonrecourse deductions'') cannot  have economic effect because the creditor alone bears any economic  burden that corresponds to those allocations. Thus, nonrecourse  deductions must be allocated in accordance with the partners' interests  in the partnership. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a test that  deems allocations of nonrecourse deductions to be in accordance with the  partners' interests in the partnership. If that test is not satisfied,  the partners' distributive shares of nonrecourse deductions are  determined under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(3), according to the partners' overall  economic interests in the partnership. See also paragraph (i) of this  section for special rules regarding the allocation of deductions  attributable to nonrecourse liabilities for which a partner bears the  economic risk of loss (as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of and allocations pursuant to a minimum gain  chargeback. To the extent a nonrecourse liability exceeds the adjusted  tax basis of the partnership property it encumbers, a disposition of  that property will generate gain that at least equals that excess  (``partnership minimum gain''). An increase in partnership minimum gain  is created by a decrease in the adjusted tax basis of property  encumbered by a nonrecourse liability below the amount of that liability  and by a partnership nonrecourse borrowing that exceeds the adjusted tax  basis of the property encumbered by the borrowing. Partnership minimum  gain decreases as reductions occur in the amount by which the  nonrecourse liability exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the property  encumbered by the liability. Allocations of gain attributable to a  decrease in partnership minimum gain (a ``minimum gain chargeback,'' as  required under paragraph (f) of this section) cannot have economic  effect because the gain merely offsets nonrecourse deductions previously  claimed by the partnership. Thus, to avoid impairing the economic effect  of other allocations, allocations pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback  must be made to the partners that either were allocated nonrecourse  deductions or received distributions of proceeds attributable to a  nonrecourse borrowing. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a test  that, if met, deems allocations of partnership income pursuant to a  minimum gain chargeback to be in accordance with   the partners' interests in the partnership. If property encumbered by a  nonrecourse liability is reflected on the partnership's books at a value  that differs from its adjusted tax basis, paragraph (d)(3) of this  section provides that minimum gain is determined with reference to the  property's book basis. See also paragraph (i)(4) of this section for  special rules regarding the minimum gain chargeback requirement for  partner nonrecourse debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i))</em> assumed by the  partnership from a partner on or after June 24, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definition of partner nonrecourse debt. Partner nonrecourse debt  or partner nonrecourse liability means any partnership liability to the  extent the liability is nonrecourse for purposes of Sec. 1.1001-2, and  a partner or related person (within the meaning of Sec. 1.752-4(b))  bears the economic risk of loss under Sec. 1.752-2 because, for  example, the partner or related person is the creditor or a guarantor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount of nonrecourse deductions. The amount of nonrecourse  deductions for a partnership taxable year equals the net increase in  partnership minimum gain during the year (determined under paragraph (d)  of this section), reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate  distributions made during the year of proceeds of a nonrecourse  liability that are allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain  (determined under paragraph (h) of this section). See paragraph (m),  Examples (1)(i) and (vi), (2), and (3) of this section. However,  increases in partnership minimum gain resulting from conversions,  refinancings, or other changes to a debt instrument (as described in  paragraph (g)(3)) do not generate nonrecourse deductions. Generally,  nonrecourse deductions consist first of certain depreciation or cost  recovery deductions and then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of other  partnership losses, deductions, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures  for that year; excess nonrecourse deductions are carried over. See  paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for more specific  ordering rules. See also paragraph (m), Example (1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Partnership minimum gain--(1) Amount of partnership minimum  gain. The amount of partnership minimum gain is determined by first  computing for each partnership nonrecourse liability any gain the  partnership would realize if it disposed of the property subject to that  liability for no consideration other than full satisfaction of the  liability, and then aggregating the separately computed gains. The  amount of partnership minimum gain includes minimum gain arising from a  conversion, refinancing, or other change to a debt instrument, as  described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, only to the extent a  partner is allocated a share of that minimum gain. For any partnership  taxable year, the net increase or decrease in partnership minimum gain  is determined by comparing the partnership minimum gain on the last day  of the immediately preceding taxable year with the partnership minimum  gain on the last day of the current taxable year. See paragraph (m),  Examples </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (i) and (iv), (2), and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property subject to more than one liability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If  property is subject to more than one liability, only the portion of the  property's adjusted tax basis that is allocated to a nonrecourse  liability under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is used to compute  minimum gain with respect to that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocating liabilities. If property is subject to two or more  liabilities of equal priority, the property's adjusted tax basis is  allocated among the liabilities in proportion to their outstanding  balances. If property is subject to two or more liabilities of unequal  priority, the adjusted tax basis is allocated first to the liability of  the highest priority to the extent of its outstanding balance and then  to each liability in descending order of priority to the extent of its  outstanding balance, until fully allocated. See paragraph (m), Example  (1) (v) and (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule for year of revaluation. If the partners' capital  accounts are increased pursuant to Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (d), (f), or  (r) to reflect a revaluation of partnership property subject to a  nonrecourse liability, the net increase or decrease in partnership  minimum gain for the partnership taxable year of the revaluation is  determined by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First calculating the net decrease or increase in partnership  minimum gain using the current year's book values and the prior year's  partnership minimum gain amount; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Then adding back any decrease in minimum gain arising solely  from the revaluation.   See paragraph (m), Example (3)(iii) of this section. If the partners'  capital accounts are decreased to reflect a revaluation, the net  increases or decreases in partnership minimum gain are determined in the  same manner as in the year before the revaluation, but by using book  values rather than adjusted tax bases. See section 7701(g) and Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(1) (property being revalued cannot be booked down  below the amount of any nonrecourse liability to which the property is  subject).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requirements to be satisfied. Allocations of nonrecourse  deductions are deemed to be in accordance with the partners' interests  in the partnership only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and  (2) of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b) are satisfied (i.e., capital accounts  are maintained in accordance with Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and  liquidating distributions are required to be made in accordance with  positive capital account balances), and requirement (3) of either Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b) or Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) is satisfied (i.e.,  partners with deficit capital accounts have an unconditional deficit  restoration obligation or agree to a qualified income offset);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beginning in the first taxable year of the partnership in which  there are nonrecourse deductions and thereafter throughout the full term  of the partnership, the partnership agreement provides for allocations  of nonrecourse deductions in a manner that is reasonably consistent with  allocations that have substantial economic effect of some other  significant partnership item attributable to the property securing the  nonrecourse liabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beginning in the first taxable year of the partnership that it  has nonrecourse deductions or makes a distribution of proceeds of a  nonrecourse liability that are allocable to an increase in partnership  minimum gain, and thereafter throughout the full term of the  partnership, the partnership agreement contains a provision that  complies with the minimum gain chargeback requirement of paragraph (f)  of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(v))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Minimum gain chargeback requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If there is  a net decrease in partnership minimum gain for a partnership taxable  year, the minimum gain chargeback requirement applies and each partner  must be allocated items of partnership income and gain for that year  equal to that partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum  gain (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain conversions and refinancings. A partner is  not subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement to the extent the  partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain is  caused by a recharacterization of nonrecourse partnership debt as  partially or wholly recourse debt or partner nonrecourse debt, and the  partner bears the economic risk of loss (within the meaning of Sec.  1.752-2) for the liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for certain capital contributions. A partner is not  subject to   the minimum gain chargeback requirement to the extent the partner  contributes capital to the partnership that is used to repay the  nonrecourse liability or is used to increase the basis of the property  subject to the nonrecourse liability, and the partner's share of the net  decrease in partnership minimum gain results from the repayment or the  increase to the property's basis. See paragraph (m), Example (1)(iv) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Waiver for certain income allocations that fail to meet minimum  gain chargeback requirement if minimum gain chargeback distorts economic  arrangement. In any taxable year that a partnership has a net decrease  in partnership minimum gain, if the minimum gain chargeback requirement  would cause a distortion in the economic arrangement among the partners  and it is not expected that the partnership will have sufficient other  income to correct that distortion, the Commissioner has the discretion,  if requested by the partnership, to waive the minimum gain chargeback  requirement. The following facts must be demonstrated in order for a  request for a waiver to be considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The partners have made capital contributions or received net  income allocations that have restored the previous nonrecourse  deductions and the distributions attributable to proceeds of a  nonrecourse liability; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum gain chargeback requirement would distort the  partners' economic arrangement as reflected in the partnership agreement  and as evidenced over the term of the partnership by the partnership's  allocations and distributions and the partners' contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional exceptions. The Commissioner may, by revenue ruling,  provide additional exceptions to the minimum gain chargeback  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Partnership items subject to the minimum gain chargeback  requirement. Any minimum gain chargeback required for a partnership  taxable year consists first of a pro rata portion of certain gains  recognized from the disposition of partnership property subject to one  or more partnership nonrecourse liabilities and income from the  discharge of indebtedness relating to one or more partnership  nonrecourse liabilities to which partnership property is subject, and  then, if necessary, consists of a pro rata portion of the partnership's  other items of income and gain for that year. If the amount of the  minimum gain chargeback requirement exceeds the partnership's income and  gains for the taxable year, the excess carries over. See paragraphs  (j)(2)(i) and (j)(2)(iii) of this section for more specific ordering  rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions in  Sec. 1.704-2(f).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Partnership AB consists of two partners, limited partner  A and general partner B. Partner A contributes $90 and Partner B  contributes $10 to the partnership. The partnership agreement has a  minimum gain chargeback provision and provides that, except as otherwise  required by section 704(c), all losses will be allocated 90 percent to A  and 10 percent to B; and that all income will be allocated first to  restore previous losses and thereafter 50 percent to A and 50 percent to  B. Distributions are made first to return initial capital to the  partners and then 50 percent to A and 50 percent to B. Final  distributions are made in accordance with capital account balances. The  partnership borrows $200 on a nonrecourse basis from an unrelated third  party and purchases an asset for $300. The partnership's only tax item  for each of the first three years in $100 of depreciation on the asset.  A's and B's shares of minimum gain (under paragraph (g) of this section)  and deficit capital account balances are $180 and $20 respectively at  the end of the third year. In the fourth year, the partnership earns  $400 of net operating income and allocates the first $300 to restore the  previous losses (i.e., $270 to A and $30 to B); the last $100 is  allocated $50 each. The partnership distributes $200 of the available  cash that same year; the first $100 is distributed $90 to A and $10 to B  to return their capital contributions; the last $100 is distributed $50  each to reflect their ratio for sharing profits.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A        B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account on formation..........................     $90      $10</p><p class="depth0">Less: Net loss in years 1-3.......................

($50)    ($50)</p><p class="depth0">----------------- Capital accounts following distribution...............     ($0)     ($0) ------------------------------------------------------------------------   In the fifth year, the partnership sells the property for $300 and  realizes $300 of gain. $200 of the proceeds are used to pay the  nonrecourse lender. The partnership has $300 to distribute, and the  partners expect to share that equally. Absent a waiver under paragraph  (f)(4) of this section, the minimum gain chargeback would require the  partnership to allocate the first $200 of the gain $180 to A and $20 to  B, which would distort their economic arrangement. This allocation,  together with the allocation of the $100 profit $50 to each partner,  would result in A having a positive capital account balance of $230 and  B having a positive capital account balance of $70. The allocation of  income in year 4 in effect anticipated the minimum gain chargeback that  did not occur until year 5. Assuming the partnership would not have  sufficient other income to correct the distortion that would otherwise  result, the partnership may request that the Commissioner exercise his  or her discretion to waive the minimum gain chargeback requirement and  recognize allocations that would allow A and B to share equally the gain  on the sale of the property. These allocations would bring the partners'  capital accounts to $150 each, allowing them to share the last $300  equally. The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, permit this  allocation pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section because the  minimum gain chargeback would distort the partners' economic arrangement  over the term of the partnership as reflected in the partnership  agreement and as evidenced by the partners' contributions and the  partnership's allocations and distributions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A and B form a partnership, contribute $25 each to the  partnership's capital, and agree to share all losses and profits 50  percent each. Neither partner has an unconditional deficit restoration  obligation and all the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section are  met. The partnership obtains a nonrecourse loan from an unrelated third  party of $100 and purchases two assets, stock for $50 and depreciable  property for $100. The nonrecourse loan is secured by the partnership's  depreciable property. The partnership generates $20 of depreciation in  each of the first five years as its only tax item. These deductions are  properly treated as nonrecourse deductions and the allocation of these  deductions 50 percent to A and 50 percent to B is deemed to be in  accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. At the end  of year five, A and B each have a $25 deficit capital account and a $50  share of partnership minimum gain. In the beginning of year six, (at the  lender's request), A guarantees the entire nonrecourse liability.  Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the partnership has a net  decrease in minimum gain of $100 and under paragraph (g)(2) of this  section, A's and B's shares of that net decrease are $50 each. Under  paragraph (f)(1) of this section (the minimum gain chargeback  requirement), B is subject to a $50 minimum gain chargeback. Because the  partnership has no gross income in year six, the entire $50 carries over  as a minimum gain chargeback requirement to succeeding taxable years  until their is enough income to cover the minimum gain chargeback  requirement. Under the exception to the minimum gain chargeback in  paragraph (f)(2) of this section, A is not subject to a minimum gain  chargeback for A's $50 share of the net decrease because A bears the  economic risk of loss for the liability. Instead, A's share of partner  nonrecourse debt minimum gain is $50 pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of  this section. In year seven, the partnership earns $100 of net operating  income and uses the money to repay the entire $100 nonrecourse debt  (that A has guaranteed). Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, the  partnership has a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain  of $50. B must be allocated $50 of the operating income pursuant to the  carried over minimum gain chargeback requirement; pursuant to paragraph  (i)(4) of this section, the other $50 of operating income must be  allocated to A as a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Shares of partnership minimum gain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Partner's share of  partnership minimum gain. Except as increased in paragraph (g) (3) of  this section, a partner's share of partnership minimum gain at the end  of any partnership taxable year equals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of nonrecourse deductions allocated to that partner (and  to that partner's predecessors in interest) up to that time and the  distributions made to that partner (and to that partner's predecessors'  in interest) up to that time of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability  allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain (see paragraph  (h)(1) of this section); minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(d)</em>, a partner's share of  partnership minimum gain is added to the limited dollar amount, if any,  of the deficit balance in the partner's capital account that the partner  is obligated to restore. See paragraph (m), Examples (1)(i) and (3)(i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain.  A partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain is the  amount of the total net decrease multiplied by the partner's percentage  share of the partnership's minimum gain at the end of the immediately  preceding taxable year. A partner's share of any decrease in partnership  minimum gain resulting from a revaluation of partnership property equals  the increase in the partner's capital account attributable to the  revaluation to the extent the reduction in minimum gain is caused by the  revaluation. See paragraph (m), Example (3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> if a recourse  or partner nonrecourse liability becomes partially or wholly  nonrecourse. If a recourse liability becomes a nonrecourse liability, a  partner has a share of the partnership's minimum gain that results from  the conversion equal to the partner's deficit capital account  (determined under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)) to the extent the partner no  longer bears the economic burden for the entire deficit capital account  as a result of the conversion. For purposes of the preceding sentence,  the determination of the extent to which a partner bears the economic  burden for a deficit capital account is made by determining the  consequences to the partner in the case of a complete liquidation of the  partnership immediately after the conversion applying the rules  described in Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iii)(c) that deem the value of  partnership property to equal its basis, taking into account section  7701(g) in the case of property that secures nonrecourse indebtedness.  If a partner nonrecourse debt becomes a nonrecourse liability, the  partner's share of partnership minimum gain is increased to the extent  the partner is not subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement  under paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Distribution of nonrecourse liability proceeds allocable to an  increase in partnership minimum gain--(1) In general. If during its  taxable year a partnership makes a distribution to the partners  allocable to the proceeds of a nonrecourse liability, the distribution  is allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain to the extent  the increase results from encumbering partnership property with  aggregate nonrecourse liabilities that exceed the property's adjusted  tax basis. See paragraph (m), Example </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(vi)</em> of this section. If the  net increase in partnership minimum gain for a partnership taxable year  is allocable to more than one nonrecourse liability, the net increase is  allocated among the liabilities in proportion to the amount each  liability contributed to the increase in minimum gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distribution allocable to nonrecourse liability proceeds. A  partnership may use any reasonable method to determine whether a  distribution by the partnership to one or more partners is allocable to  proceeds of a nonrecourse liability. The rules prescribed under Sec.  1.163-8T for allocating debt proceeds among expenditures (applying those  rules to the partnership as if it were an individual) constitute a  reasonable method for determining whether the nonrecourse liability  proceeds are distributed to the partners and the partners to whom the  proceeds are distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Option when there is an obligation to restore. A partnership may  treat any distribution to a partner of the proceeds of a nonrecourse  liability (that would otherwise be allocable to an increase in  partnership minimum gain) as a distribution that is not allocable to an  increase in partnership minimum gain to the extent the distribution does  not cause or increase a deficit balance in the partner's capital account  that exceeds the amount the partner is otherwise obligated to restore  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)) as of the end of the  partnership taxable year in which the distribution occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carryover to immediately succeeding taxable year. The carryover  rule of this paragraph applies if the net increase in partnership  minimum gain for a partnership taxable year that is allocable to a  nonrecourse liability under paragraph (h)(2) of this section exceeds the  distributions allocable to the proceeds of the liability (``excess  allocable amount''), and all or part of the net increase in partnership  minimum gain for the year is carried over as an increase in partnership  minimum gain for the immediately succeeding taxable year (pursuant to  paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section). If the carryover rule of this  paragraph applies, the excess allocable amount (or the amount carried  over under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, if less) is treated in  the succeeding taxable year as an increase in partnership minimum gain  that arose in that year as a result of incurring the nonrecourse  liability to which the excess allocable amount is attributable. See  paragraph (m), Example (1)(vi) of this section. If for a partnership  taxable year there is an excess allocable amount with respect to more  than one partnership nonrecourse liability, the excess allocable amount  is allocated to each liability in proportion to the amount each  liability contributed to the increase in minimum gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partnership nonrecourse liabilities where a partner bears the  economic risk of loss--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Partnership losses, deductions,  or section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures that are attributable to a  particular partner nonrecourse liability (``partner nonrecourse  deductions,'' as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) must be  allocated to the partner that bears the economic risk of loss for the  liability. If more than one partner bears the economic risk of loss for  a partner nonrecourse liability, any partner nonrecourse deductions  attributable to that liability must be allocated among the partners  according to the ratio in which they bear the economic risk of loss. If  partners bear the economic risk of loss for different portions of a  liability, each portion is treated as a separate partner nonrecourse  liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of and determination of partner nonrecourse  deductions. For any partnership taxable year, the amount of partner  nonrecourse deductions with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt equals  the net increase during the year in minimum gain attributable to the  partner nonrecourse debt (``partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain''),  reduced (but not below zero) by proceeds of the liability distributed  during the year to the partner bearing the economic risk of loss for the  liability that are both attributable to the liability and allocable to  an increase in the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain. See paragraph  (m), Example (1) (viii) and (ix) of this section.

For purposes of Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d), a partner's share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum  gain is added to the limited dollar amount, if any, of the deficit  balance in the partner's capital account that the partner is obligated  to restore, and the partner is not otherwise considered to have a  deficit restoration obligation as a result of bearing the economic risk  of loss for any partner nonrecourse debt.

The sum of  the nonrecourse deductions that the lower-tier partnership allocates to  the upper-tier partnership for any taxable year of the upper-tier  partnership, and the distributions made during that taxable year from  the lower-tier partnership to the upper-tier partnership of proceeds of  nonrecourse debt that are allocable to an increase in the lower-tier  partnership's minimum gain, is treated as an increase in the upper-tier  partnership's minimum gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Decrease in upper-tier partnership's minimum gain.

The principles of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonrecourse deductions and partnerships minimum gain. For  Example 1, unless otherwise provided, the following facts are assumed.  LP, the limited partner, and GP, the general partner, form a limited  partnership to acquire and operate a commercial office building. LP  contributes $180,000, and GP contributes $20,000. The partnership  obtains an $800,000 nonrecourse loan and purchases the building (on  leased land) for $1,000,000. The nonrecourse loan is secured only by the  building, and no principal payments are due for 5 years. The partnership  agreement provides that GP will be required to restore any deficit  balance in GP's capital account following the liquidation of GP's  interest (as set forth in Sec. 1.704-1 (b) (2)(ii)(b)(3)), and LP will  not be required to restore any deficit balance in LP's capital account  following the liquidation of LP's interest. The partnership agreement  contains the following provisions required by paragraph (e) of this  section: a qualified income offset (as defined in Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d)); a minimum gain chargeback (in accordance with paragraph  (f) of this section); a provision that the partners' capital accounts  will be determined and maintained in accordance with Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(1); and a provision that distributions will be made in  accordance with partners' positive capital account balances (as set  forth in Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2)). In addition, as of the end of  each partnership taxable year discussed herein, the items described in  Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) (4), (5), and (6) are not reasonably expected  to cause or increase a deficit balance in LP's capital account. The  partnership agreement provides that, except as otherwise required by its  qualified income offset and minimum gain chargeback provisions, all  partnership items will be allocated 90 percent to LP and 10 percent to  GP until the first time when the partnership has recognized items of  income and gain that exceed the items of loss and deduction it has  recognized over its life, and all further partnership items will be  allocated equally between LP and GP. Finally, the partnership agreement  provides that all distributions, other than distributions in liquidation  of the partnership or of a partner's interest in the partnership, will  be made 90 percent to LP and 10 percent to GP until a total of $200,000  has been distributed, and thereafter all the distributions will be made  equally to LP and GP. In each of the partnership's first 2 taxable  years, it generates rental income of $95,000, operating expenses  (including land lease payments) of $10,000, interest expense of $80,000,  and a depreciation deduction of $90,000, resulting in a net taxable loss  of $85,000 in each of those years. The allocations of these losses 90  per percent to LP and 10 percent to GP have substantial economic effect.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account on formation.....................   $180,000    $20,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: net loss in years 1 and 2..............

The partnership makes no distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculation of nonrecourse deductions and partnership minimum  gain. If the partnership were to dispose of the building in full  satisfaction of the nonrecourse liability at the end of the third year,  it would realize $70,000 of gain ($800,000 amount realized less $730,000  adjusted tax basis). Because the amount of partnership minimum gain at  the end of the third year (and the net increase in partnership minimum  gain during the year) is $70,000, there are partnership nonrecourse  deductions for that year of $70,000, consisting of depreciation  deductions allowable with respect to the building of $70,000. Pursuant  to the partnership agreement, all partnership items comprising the net  taxable loss of $85,000, including the $70,000 nonrecourse deduction,  are allocated 90 percent to LP and 10 percent to GP. The allocation of  these items, other than the nonrecourse deductions, has substantial  economic effect.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account at end of year 2.................    $27,000     $3,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: net loss in year 3 (without nonrecourse    (13,500)    (1,500)</p><p class="depth0">deductions).................................</p><p class="depth0">Less: nonrecourse deductions in year 3.......

($49,500)   ($5,500) ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The allocation of the $70,000 nonrecourse deduction satisfies  requirement (2) of paragraph (e) of this section because it is  consistent with allocations having substantial   economic effect of other significant partnership items attributable to  the building. Because the remaining requirements of paragraph (e) of  this section are satisfied, the allocation of nonrecourse deductions is  deemed to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the  partnership. At the end of the partnership's third taxable year, LP's  and GP's shares of partnership minimum gain are $63,000 and $7,000,  respectively. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section,  LP is treated as obligated to restore a deficit capital account balance  of $63,000, so that in the succeeding year LP could be allocated up to  an additional $13,500 of partnership deductions, losses, and section  705(a)(2)(B) items that are not nonrecourse deductions. Even though this  allocation would increase a deficit capital account balance, it would be  considered to have economic effect under the alternate economic effect  test contained in Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). If the partnership were to  dispose of the building in full satisfaction of the nonrecourse  liability at the beginning of the partnership's fourth taxable year (and  had no other economic activity in that year), the partnership minimum  gain would be decreased from $70,000 to zero, and the minimum gain  chargeback would require that LP and GP be allocated $63,000 and $7,000,  respectively, of the gain from that disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration of reasonable consistency requirement. Assume  instead that the partnership agreement provides that all nonrecourse  deductions of the partnership will be allocated equally between LP and  GP. Furthermore, at the time the partnership agreement is entered into,  there is a reasonable likelihood that over the partnership's life it  will realize amounts of income and gain significantly in excess of  amounts of loss and deduction (other than nonrecourse deductions). The  equal allocation of excess income and gain has substantial economic  effect.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account on formation.....................   $180,000    $20,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: net loss in years 1 and 2..............

($21,500)  ($33,500) ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The allocation of the $70,000 nonrecourse deduction equally between LP  and GP satisfies requirement (2) of paragraph (e) of this section  because the allocation is consistent with allocations, which will have  substantial economic effect, of other significant partnership items  attributable to the building. Because the remaining requirements of  paragraph (e) of this section are satisfied, the allocation of  nonrecourse deductions is deemed to be in accordance with the partners'  interests in the partnership. The allocation of the nonrecourse  deductions 75 percent to LP and 25 percent to GP (or in any other ratio  between 90 percent to LP/10 percent to GP and 50 percent to LP/50  percent to GP) also would satisfy requirement (2) of paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of nonrecourse deductions that fails reasonable  consistency requirement. Assume instead that the partnership agreement  provides that LP will be allocated 99 percent, and GP 1 percent, of all  nonrecourse deductions of the partnership. Allocating nonrecourse  deductions this way does not satisfy requirement (2) of paragraph (e) of  this section because the allocations are not reasonably consistent with  allocations, having substantial economic effect, of any other  significant partnership item attributable to the building. Therefore,  the allocation of nonrecourse deductions will be disregarded, and the  nonrecourse deductions of the partnership will be reallocated according  to the partners' overall economic interests in the partnership,  determined under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Capital contribution to pay down nonrecourse debt. At the  beginning of the partnership's fourth taxable year, LP contributes  $144,000 and GP contributes $16,000 of addition capital to the  partnership, which the partnership immediately uses to reduce the amount  of its nonrecourse liability from $800,000 to $640,000. In addition, in  the partnership's fourth taxable year, it generates rental income of  $95,000, operating expenses of $10,000, interest expense of $64,000  (consistent with the debt reduction), and a depreciation deduction of  $90,000, resulting in a net taxable loss of $69,000. If the partnership  were to dispose of the building in full satisfaction of the nonrecourse  liability at the end of that year, it would realize no gain ($640,000  amount realized less $640,000 adjusted tax basis). Therefore, the amount  of partnership minimum gain at the end of the year is zero, which  represents a net decrease in partnership minimum gain of $70,000 during  the year. LP's and GP's shares of this net decrease are $63,000 and  $7,000 respectively, so that at the end of the partnership's fourth  taxable year, LP's and GP's shares of partnership minimum gain are zero.  Although there has been a net decrease in partnership minimum gain,  pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section LP and GP are not subject  to a minimum gain chargeback.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account at end of year 3.................

Assume instead that the building  acquired by the partnership is secured by a $700,000 nonrecourse loan  and a $100,000 recourse loan, subordinate in priority to the nonrecourse  loan. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, $700,000 of the adjusted  basis of the building at the end of the partnership's third taxable year  is allocated to the nonrecourse liability (with the remaining $30,000  allocated to the recourse liability) so that if the partnership disposed  of the building in full satisfaction of the nonrecourse liability at the  end of that year, it would realize no gain ($700,000 amount realized  less $700,000 adjusted tax basis). Therefore, there is no minimum gain  (or increase in minimum gain) at the end of the partnership's third  taxable year. If, however, the $700,000 nonrecourse loan were  subordinate in priority to the $100,000 recourse loan, under paragraph  (d)(2) of this section, the first $100,000 of adjusted tax basis in the  building would be allocated to the recourse liability, leaving only  $630,000 of the adjusted basis of the building to be allocated to the  $700,000 nonrecourse loan. In that case, the balance of the $700,000  nonrecourse liability would exceed the adjusted tax basis of the  building by $70,000, so that there would be $70,000 of minimum gain (and  a $70,000 increase in partnership minimum gain) in the partnership's  third taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Nonrecourse borrowing; distribution of proceeds in subsequent  year. The partnership obtains an additional nonrecourse loan of $200,000  at the end of its fourth taxable year, secured by a second mortgage on  the building, and distributes $180,000 of this cash to its partners at  the beginning of its fifth taxable year. In addition, in its fourth and  fifth taxable years, the partnership again generates rental income of  $95,000, operating expenses of $10,000, interest expense of $80,000  ($100,000 in the fifth taxable year reflecting the interest paid on both  liabilities), and a depreciation deduction of $90,000, resulting in a  net taxable loss of $85,000 ($105,000 in the fifth taxable year  reflecting the interest paid on both liabilities). The partnership has  distributed its $5,000 of operating cash flow in each year ($95,000 of  rental income less $10,000 of operating expense and $80,000 of interest  expense) to LP and GP at the end of each year. If the partnership were  to dispose of the building in full satisfaction of both nonrecourse  liabilities at the end of its fourth taxable year, the partnership would  realize $360,000 of gain ($1,000,000 amount realized less $640,000  adjusted tax basis). Thus, the net increase in partnership minimum gain  during the partnership's fourth taxable year is $290,000 ($360,000 of  minimum gain at the end of the fourth year less $70,000 of minimum gain  at the end of the third year). Because the partnership did not  distribute any of the proceeds of the loan it obtained in its fourth  year during that year, the potential amount of partnership nonrecourse  deductions for that year is $290,000. Under paragraph (c) of this  section, if the partnership had distributed the proceeds of that loan to  its partners at the end of its fourth year, the partnership's  nonrecourse deductions for that year would have been reduced by the  amount of that distribution because the proceeds of that loan are  allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain under paragraph  (h)(1) of this section. Because the nonrecourse deductions of $290,000  for the partnership's fourth taxable year exceed its total deductions  for that year, all $180,000 of the partnership's deductions for that  year are treated as nonrecourse deductions, and the $110,000 excess  nonrecourse deductions are treated as an increase in partnership minimum  gain in the partnership's fifth taxable year under paragraph (c) of this  section.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account at end of year 3 (including cash    ($63,000)   ($7,000)</p><p class="depth0">flow distributions).............................

($144,000)  ($16,000) ------------------------------------------------------------------------  At the end of the partnership's fourth taxable year, LP's and GP's  shares of partnership minimum gain are $225,000 and $25,000,  respectively (because the $110,000 excess of nonrecourse deductions is  carried forward to the next year). If the partnership were to dispose of  the building in full satisfaction of the nonrecourse liabilities at the  end of its fifth taxable year, the partnership would realize $450,000 of  gain ($1,000,000 amount realized less $550,000 adjusted tax basis).  Therefore, the net increase in partnership minimum gain during the  partnership's fifth taxable year is $200,000 ($110,000 deemed increase  plus the $90,000 by which minimum gain at the end of the fifth year  exceeds minimum gain at the end of the fourth year ($450,000 less  $360,000)). At the beginning of its fifth year, the partnership  distributes $180,000 of the loan proceeds (retaining $20,000 to pay the  additional interest expense). Under paragraph (h) of this section, the  first $110,000 of this distribution (an amount equal to the deemed  increase in partnership minimum gain for the year) is considered  allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain for the year. As a  result, the amount of nonrecourse deductions for the partnership's fifth  taxable year is $90,000 ($200,000 net increase in minimum gain less  $110,000 distribution of nonrecourse liability proceeds allocable to an  increase in partnership minimum gain), and the nonrecourse deductions   consist solely of the $90,000 depreciation deduction allowable with  respect to the building. As a result of the distributions during the  partnership's fifth taxable year, the total distributions to the  partners over the partnership's life equal $205,000. Therefore, the last  $5,000 distributed to the partners during the fifth year will be divided  equally between them under the partnership agreement. Thus, out of the  $185,000 total distribution during the partnership's fifth taxable year,  the first $180,000 is distributed 90 percent to LP and 10 percent to GP,  and the last $5,000 is divided equally between them.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">LP          GP ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account at end of year 4...............

LP and GP personally  guarantee the ``first'' $100,000 of the $800,000 nonrecourse loan (i.e.,  only if the building is worth less than $100,000 will they be called  upon to make up any deficiency). Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,  only $630,000 of the adjusted tax basis of the building is allocated to  the $700,000 nonrecourse portion of the loan because the collateral will  be applied first to satisfy the $100,000 guaranteed portion, making it  superior in priority to the remainder of the loan. On the other hand, if  LP and GP were to guarantee the ``last'' $100,000 (i.e., if the building  is worth less than $800,000, they will be called upon to make up the  deficiency up to $100,000), $700,000 of the adjusted tax basis of the  building would be allocated to the $700,000 nonrecourse portion of the  loan because the guaranteed portion would be inferior in priority to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Partner nonrecourse debt. Assume instead that the $800,000  loan is made by LP, the limited partner. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this  section, the $800,000 obligation does not constitute a nonrecourse  liability of the partnership for purposes of this section because LP, a  partner, bears the economic risk of loss for that loan within the  meaning of Sec. 1.752-2. Instead, the $800,000 loan constitutes a  partner nonrecourse debt under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In the  partnership's third taxable year, partnership minimum gain would have  increased by $70,000 if the debt were a nonrecourse liability of the  partnership. Thus, under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, there is a  net increase of $70,000 in the minimum gain attributable to the $800,000  partner nonrecourse debt for the partnership's third taxable year, and  $70,000 of the $90,000 depreciation deduction from the building for the  partnership's third taxable year constitutes a partner nonrecourse  deduction with respect to the debt. See paragraph (i)(4) of this  section. Under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, this partner  nonrecourse deduction must be allocated to LP, the partner that bears  the economic risk of loss for that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Nonrecourse debt and partner nonrecourse debt of differing  priorities. As in Example 1 (viii) of this paragraph (m), the $800,000  loan is made to the partnership by LP, the limited partner, but the loan  is a purchase money loan that ``wraps around'' a $700,000 underlying  nonrecourse note (also secured by the building) issued by LP to an  unrelated person in connection with LP's acquisition of the building.  Under these circumstances, LP bears the economic risk of loss with  respect to only $100,000 of the liability within the meaning of Sec.  1.752-2. See Sec. 1.752-2(f) (Example 6). Therefore, for purposes of  paragraph (d) of this section, the $800,000 liability is treated as a  $700,000 nonrecourse liability of the partnership and a $100,000 partner  nonrecourse debt (inferior in priority to the $700,000 liability) of the  partnership for which LP bears the economic risk of loss. Under  paragraph (i)(2) of this section, $70,000 of the $90,000 depreciation  deduction realized in the partnership's third taxable year constitutes a  partner nonrecourse deduction that must be allocated to LP.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Netting of increases and decreases in partnership minimum  gain. For Example 2 unless otherwise provided, the following facts are  assumed. X and Y form a general partnership to acquire and operate  residential real properties. Each partner contributes $150,000 to the  partnership. The partnership obtains a $1,500,000 nonrecourse loan and  purchases 3 apartment buildings (on leased land) for $720,000  (``Property A''), $540,000 (``Property B''), and $540,000 (``Property  C''). The nonrecourse loan is secured only by the 3 buildings, and no  principal payments are due for 5 years. In each of the partnership's  first 3 taxable years, it generates rental income of $225,000, operating  expenses (including land lease payments) of $50,000, interest expense   of $175,000, and depreciation deductions on the 3 properties of $150,000  ($60,000 on Property A and $45,000 on each of Property B and Property  C), resulting in a net taxable loss of $150,000 in each of those years.  The partnership makes no distributions to X or Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculation of net increases and decreases in partnership  minimum gain. If the partnership were to dispose of the 3 apartment  buildings in full satisfaction of its nonrecourse liability at the end  of its third taxable year, it would realize $150,000 of gain ($1,500,000  amount realized less $1,350,000 adjusted tax basis). Because the amount  of partnership minimum gain at the end of that year (and the net  increase in partnership minimum gain during that year) is $150,000, the  amount of partnership nonrecourse deductions for that year is $150,000,  consisting of depreciation deductions allowable with respect to the 3  apartment buildings of $150,000. The result would be the same if the  partnership obtained 3 separate nonrecourse loans that were ``cross- collateralized'' (i.e., if each separate loan were secured by all 3 of  the apartment buildings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Netting of increases and decreases in partnership minimum gain  when there is a disposition. At the beginning of the partnership's  fourth taxable year, the partnership (with the permission of the  nonrecourse lender) disposes of Property A for $835,000 and uses a  portion of the proceeds to repay $600,000 of the nonrecourse liability  (the principal amount attributable to Property A), reducing the balance  to $900,000. As a result of the disposition, the partnership realizes  gain of $295,000 ($835,000 amount realized less $540,000 adjusted tax  basis). If the disposition is viewed in isolation, the partnership has  generated minimum gain of $60,000 on the sale of Property A ($600,000 of  debt reduction less $540,000 adjusted tax basis). However, during the  partnership's fourth taxable year it also generates rental income of  $135,000, operating expenses of $30,000, interest expense of $105,000,  and depreciation deductions of $90,000 ($45,000 on each remaining  building). If the partnership were to dispose of the remaining two  buildings in full satisfaction of its nonrecourse liability at the end  of the partnership's fourth taxable year, it would realize gain of  $180,000 ($900,000 amount realized less $720,000 aggregate adjusted tax  basis), which is the amount of partnership minimum gain at the end of  the year. Because the partnership minimum gain increased from $150,000  to $180,000 during the partnership's fourth taxable year, the amount of  partnership nonrecourse deductions for that year is $30,000, consisting  of a ratable portion of depreciation deductions allowable with respect  to the two remaining apartment buildings. No minimum gain chargeback is  required for the taxable year, even though the partnership disposed of  one of the properties subject to the nonrecourse liability during the  year, because there is no net decrease in partnership minimum gain for  the year. See paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Nonrecourse deductions and partnership minimum gain  before third partner is admitted. For purposes of Example 3, unless  otherwise provided, the following facts are assumed. Additional facts  are given in each of Examples 3 (ii), (iii), and (iv). A and B form a  limited partnership to acquire and lease machinery that is 5-year  recovery property. A, the limited partner, and B, the general partner,  contribute $100,000 each to the partnership, which obtains an $800,000  nonrecourse loan and purchases the machinery for $1,000,000. The  nonrecourse loan is secured only by the machinery. The principal amount  of the loan is to be repaid $50,000 per year during each of the  partnership's first 5 taxable years, with the remaining $550,000 of  unpaid principal due on the first day of the partnership's sixth taxable  year. The partnership agreement contains all of the provisions required  by paragraph (e) of this section, and, as of the end of each partnership  taxable year discussed herein, the items described in Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d) (4), (5), and (6) are not reasonably expected to cause or  increase a deficit balance in A's or B's capital account. The  partnership agreement provides that, except as otherwise required by its  qualified income offset and minimum gain chargeback provisions, all  partnership items will be allocated equally between A and B. Finally,  the partnership agreement provides that all distributions, other than  distributions in liquidation of the partnership or of a partner's  interest in the partnership, will be made equally between A and B. In  the partnership's first taxable year it generates rental income of  $130,000, interest expense of $80,000, and a depreciation deduction of  $150,000, resulting in a net taxable loss of $100,000. In addition, the  partnership repays $50,000 of the nonrecourse liability, reducing that  liability to $750,000. Allocations of these losses equally between A and  B have substantial economic effect.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A           B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account on formation....................   $100,000    $100,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: net loss in year 1....................

In addition, the  partnership repays $50,000 of the nonrecourse liability, reducing that  liability to $700,000, and distributes $2,500 of cash to each partner.  If the partnership were to dispose of the machinery   in full satisfaction of the nonrecourse liability at the end of that  year, it would realize $70,000 of gain ($700,000 amount realized less  $630,000 adjusted tax basis). Therefore, the amount of partnership  minimum gain at the end of that year (and the net increase in  partnership minimum gain during the year) is $70,000, and the amount of  partnership nonrecourse deductions for the year is $70,000. The  partnership nonrecourse deductions for its second taxable year consist  of $70,000 of the depreciation deductions allowable with respect to the  machinery. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, all partnership items  comprising the net taxable loss of $165,000, including the $70,000  nonrecourse deduction, are allocated equally between A and B. The  allocation of these items, other than the nonrecourse deductions, has  substantial economic effect.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A          B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account at end of year 1..................   $50,000    $50,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: net loss in year 2 (without nonrecourse    (47,500)   (47,500)</p><p class="depth0">deductions)..................................</p><p class="depth0">Less: nonrecourse deductions in year 2........

Because all of the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section  are satisfied, the allocation of nonrecourse deductions is deemed to be  made in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. At  the end of the partnership's second taxable year, A's and B's shares of  partnership minimum gain are $35,000 each. Therefore, pursuant to  paragraph (g)(1) of this section, A and B are treated as obligated to  restore deficit balances in their capital accounts of $35,000 each. If  the partnership were to dispose of the machinery in full satisfaction of  the nonrecourse liability at the beginning of the partnership's third  taxable year (and had no other economic activity in that year), the  partnership minimum gain would be decreased from $70,000 to zero. A's  and B's shares of that net decrease would be $35,000 each. Upon that  disposition, the minimum gain chargeback would require that A and B each  be allocated $35,000 of that gain before any other allocation is made  under section 704 (b) with respect to partnership items for the  partnership's third taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonrecourse deductions and restatement of capital accounts. (a)  Additional facts. C is admitted to the partnership at the beginning of  the partnership's third taxable year. At the time of C's admission, the  fair market value of the machinery is $900,000. C contributes $100,000  to the partnership (the partnership invests $95,000 of this in  undeveloped land and holds the other $5,000 in cash) in exchange for an  interest in the partnership. In connection with C's admission to the  partnership, the partnership's machinery is revalued on the  partnership's books to reflect its fair market value of $900,000.  Pursuant to Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the capital accounts of A and B  are adjusted upwards to $100,000 each to reflect the revaluation of the  partnership's machinery. This adjustment reflects the manner in which  the partnership gain of $270,000 ($900,000 fair market value minus  $630,000 adjusted tax basis) would be shared if the machinery were sold  for its fair market value immediately prior to C's admission to the  partnership.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A           B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capital account before C's admission............

The partnership agreement also is modified to provide that depreciation  and gain or loss, as computed for tax purposes, with respect to the  machinery will be shared among the partners in a manner that takes  account of the variation between the property's $630,000 adjusted tax  basis and its $900,000 book value, in accordance with Sec. 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and the special rule contained in Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(iv)</em>. If the partnership were to dispose of the machinery in full  satisfaction of the nonrecourse liability immediately following the  revaluation of the machinery, it would realize no book gain ($700,000  amount realized less $900,000 book value). As a result of the  revaluation of the machinery upward by $270,000, under part (i) of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the partnership minimum gain is  reduced from $70,000 immediately prior to the revaluation to zero; but  under part (ii) of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the partnership  minimum gain is increased by the $70,000 decrease arising solely from  the revaluation. Accordingly, there is no net increase or decrease  solely on account of the revaluation, and so no minimum gain chargeback  is triggered. All future nonrecourse deductions that occur will be the  nonrecourse deductions as calculated   for book purposes, and will be charged to all 3 partners in accordance  with the partnership agreement. For purposes of determining the  partners' shares of minimum gain under paragraph (g) of this section,  A's and B's shares of the decrease resulting from the revaluation are  $35,000 each. However, as illustrated below, under section 704(c)  principles, the tax capital accounts of A and B will eventually be  charged $35,000 each, reflecting their 50 percent shares of the decrease  in partnership minimum gain that resulted from the revaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of nonrecourse deductions following restatement of  capital accounts. (a) Additional facts.

Allocations of increase in partnership minimum gain among  partnership properties. For Example 4, unless otherwise provided, the  following facts are assumed. A partnership owns 4 properties, each of  which is subject to a nonrecourse liability of the partnership. During a  taxable year of the partnership, the following events take place. First,  the partnership generates a depreciation deduction (for both book and  tax purposes) with respect to Property W of $10,000 and repays $5,000 of  the nonrecourse liability secured only by that property, resulting in an  increase in minimum gain with respect to   that liability of $5,000. Second, the partnership generates a  depreciation deduction (for both book and tax purposes) with respect to  Property X of $10,000 and repays none of the nonrecourse liability  secured by that property, resulting in an increase in minimum gain with  respect to that liability of $10,000. Third, the partnership generates a  depreciation deduction (for both book and tax purposes) of $2,000 with  respect to Property Y and repays $11,000 of the nonrecourse liability  secured only by that property, resulting in a decrease in minimum gain  with respect to that liability of $9,000 (although at the end of that  year, there remains minimum gain with respect to that liability).  Finally, the partnership borrows $5,000 on a nonrecourse basis, giving  as the only security for that liability Property Z, a parcel of  undeveloped land with an adjusted tax basis (and book value) of $2,000,  resulting in a net increase in minimum gain with respect to that  liability of $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocation of increase in partnership minimum gain. The net  increase in partnership minimum gain during that partnership taxable  year is $9,000, so that the amount of nonrecourse deductions of the  partnership for that taxable year is $9,000. Those nonrecourse  deductions consist of $3,000 of depreciation deductions with respect to  Property W and $6,000 of depreciation deductions with respect to  Property X. See paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of nonrecourse  deductions consisting of depreciation deductions is determined as  follows. With respect to the nonrecourse liability secured by Property  Z, for which there is no depreciation deduction, the amount of  depreciation deductions that constitutes nonrecourse deductions is zero.  Similarly, with respect to the nonrecourse liability secured by Property  Y, for which there is no increase in minimum gain, the amount of  depreciation deductions that constitutes nonrecourse deductions is zero.  With respect to each of the nonrecourse liabilities secured by  Properties W and X, which are secured by property for which there are  depreciation deductions and for which there is an increase in minimum  gain, the amount of depreciation deductions that constitutes nonrecourse  deductions is determined by the following formula:   net increase in the partnership minimum gain for that taxable year X  total depreciation deductions for that taxable year on the specific  property securing the nonrecourse liability to the extent minimum gain  increased on that liability (divided by) total depreciation deductions  for that taxable year on all properties securing nonrecourse liabilities  to the extent of the aggregate increase in minimum gain on all those  liabilities.  Thus, for the liability secured by Property W, the amount is $9,000  times $5,000/$15,000, or $3,000. For the liability secured by Property  X, the amount is $9,000 times $10,000/$15,000, or $6,000. (If one  depreciable property secured two partnership nonrecourse liabilities,  the amount of depreciation or book depreciation with respect to that  property would be allocated among those liabilities in accordance with  the method by which adjusted basis is allocated under paragraph (d)(2)  of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative allocation of increase in partnership minimum gain  among partnership properties. Assume instead that the loan secured by  Property Z is $15,000 (rather than $5,000), resulting in a net increase  in minimum gain with respect to that liability of $13,000. Thus, the net  increase in partnership minimum gain is $19,000, and the amount of  nonrecourse deductions of the partnership for that taxable year is  $19,000. Those nonrecourse deductions consist of $5,000 of depreciation  deductions with respect to Property W, $10,000 of depreciation  deductions with respect to Property X, and a pro rata portion of the  partnership's other items of deduction, loss, and section 705(a)(2)(B)  expenditure for that year. The method for computing the amounts of  depreciation deductions that constitute nonrecourse deductions is the  same as in (i) of this Example 4 for the liabilities secured by  Properties Y and Z. With respect to each of the nonrecourse liabilities  secured by Properties W and X, the amount of depreciation deductions  that constitutes nonrecourse deductions equals the total depreciation  deductions with respect to the partnership property securing that  particular liability to the extent of the increase in minimum gain with  respect to that liability.
