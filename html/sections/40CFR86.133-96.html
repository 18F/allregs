                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and  gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles following  the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 24-hour cycle, with  the highest emission level used to determine compliance with the  standards specified in subpart A of this part. The Administrator may  truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle without affecting the validity  of the collected data. Sampling of emissions from the running loss and  hot soak tests is not required as preparation for the diurnal emission  test. The diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the  three- diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test  sequence, as described in Sec. 86.130-96.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the full three-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal emission  test outlined in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section follows the  high-temperature hot soak test concluded in Sec. 86.138-96(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal  emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the  alternate hot soak test specified in Sec. 86.138-96(k). This test is not  required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test vehicle shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor  more than 36 hours between the end of the hot soak test and the start of  the diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of this period,  the vehicle shall be soaked at 72[3 F. The temperature tolerance may  be waived for up to 10 minutes to allow purging of the enclosure or  transporting the vehicle into the enclosure at the beginning of the  diurnal emission test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The test vehicle shall be exposed to ambient temperatures cycled  according to the profile specified in Sec. 86.133 and appendix II of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temperatures measured with the underbody temperature sensor  shall follow the profile with a maximum deviation of 3 F at any time  and an average temperature deviation not to exceed 2 F, where the  average deviation is calculated using the absolute value of each  measured deviation. In addition, the temperature from the sidewall  temperature sensors shall follow the profile with a maximum deviation of  5 F at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ambient temperatures shall be measured at least every minute.  Temperature cycling shall begin when time=0 minutes, as specified in  paragraph (i)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The diurnal enclosure shall be purged for several minutes prior  to the test. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons,  of methanol or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the  enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at  least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The test vehicle, with the engine shut off and the test vehicle  windows and luggage compartment(s) opened, shall be moved into the  diurnal enclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)-(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prior to sampling for emissions and throughout the period of  cycled ambient temperatures, the mixing fan(s) shall circulate the air  at a rate of 0.8[0.2 cfm per cubic foot of ambient volume. The mixing  fan(s), plus any additional fans if needed, shall also maintain a  minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/hr) under the fuel tank of the test  vehicle. The Administrator may adjust fan speed and location to ensure  sufficient air circulation around the fuel tank. The wind speed  requirement may be satisfied by consistently using a fan configuration  that has been demonstrated to maintain a broad 5-mph air flow in the  vicinity of the vehicle's fuel tank, subject to verification by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Emission sampling may begin as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and  spanned immediately prior to the sampling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impingers charged with known volumes of pure deionized water  shall be placed in the methanol sampling system (methanol-fueled  vehicles only).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Turn off purge blowers (if not already off).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Close and seal enclosure doors (if not already closed and  sealed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within 10 minutes of closing and sealing the doors, analyze  enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the initial  (time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, CHCi, required in  Sec. 86.143. Hydrocarbon emissions may be sampled continuously during  the test period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable,  and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the  initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 4.0[0.5 minutes.  This is the initial methanol concentration,  CCH3OHi, required in Sec. 86.143. Record the time  elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is  inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow  accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and  then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow  rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow  through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses. If the  test is conducted in a fixed-volume enclosure that allows airflow into  and   out of the enclosure, the effect of makeup air dilution must be factored  into the analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If testing indicates that a vehicle design may result in fuel  temperature responses during enclosure testing that are not  representative of in-use summertime conditions, the Administrator may  adjust air circulation and temperature during the test as needed to  ensure that the test sufficiently duplicates the vehicle's in-use  experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and  spanned immediately prior to the end of each emission sampling period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection  system immediately prior to the end of each emission measurement, if  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The end of the first, second, and third emission sampling period  shall occur 1440[6, 2880[6, 4320[6 minutes, respectively, after the  beginning of the initial sampling, as specified in paragraph (i)(5) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the end of each emission sampling period, analyze the  enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the final  hydrocarbon concentration, CHCf, required in Sec. 86.143. The  emission measurement at the end of each period becomes the initial  hydrocarbon concentration, CHCi, of the next emission  sampling period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable,  and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the  initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 4.0[0.5 minutes.  This is the final (time=1440 minutes) methanol concentration,  CCH3OHf, required in Sec. 86.143. Record the time  elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is  inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow  accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and  then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow  rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow  through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses. If the  test is conducted in a fixed-volume enclosure that allows airflow into  and out of the enclosure, the effect of makeup air dilution must be  factored into the analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> At the end of the temperature cycling period the enclosure doors  shall be unsealed and opened, the test vehicle windows and luggage  compartments may be closed and the test vehicle, with the engine shut  off, shall be removed from the enclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> This completes the full three-diurnal evaporative emission test  sequence described in Sec. 86.130-96.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in  Sec. 86.130-96, the following steps shall be performed in lieu of the  steps described in paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the test vehicle  shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor more than 36 hours between  the end of the hot soak test described in Sec. 86.138-96(k), and the  start of the two-diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of  this period, the vehicle shall be soaked at 72[3 F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vehicle shall be tested for diurnal emissions according to  the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section,  except that the test includes only two 24-hour periods. Therefore the  end of the first and second emission sampling periods shall occur 1440[6  and 2880[6 minutes, respectively, after the initial sampling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This completes the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence for  evaporative emission measurement.
