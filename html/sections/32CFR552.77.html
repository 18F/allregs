                            <p class="depth0">The installation commander will personally approve all cases in which solicitation privileges have been denied or suspended for cause. This includes agents, companies, or other commercial enterprises. Authority to temporarily suspend solicitation privileges for 30 days or less while an investigation is conducted may be delegated by the commander to the installation solicitation officer or other designee. Exception to this time frame must be approved by The Adjutant General (DAAG-PSI) or by the overseas commander. The commander will make the final determination.


Sec. 552.78  ``Show cause'' hearing.</p><p class="depth0">Before suspending the solicitation privilege, the company and the agent will have a chance to show cause why the action should not be taken. ``Show cause'' is an opportunity for the company, the agent, or both to present facts informally on their behalf. The company and agent will be notified, by letter, far in advance of the pending hearing. If unable to notify the agent directly or indirectly of the hearing, then the hearing may proceed.</p>
