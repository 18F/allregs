If it is intended for administration by parenteral injection, the quantity or proportion of all inactive ingredients, except that ingredients added to adjust the pH or to make the drug isotonic may be declared by name and a statement of their effect; and if the vehicle is water for injection, it need not be named.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An identifying lot or control number from which it is possible to determine the complete manufacturing history of the package of the drug;
Provided, however, That in the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear all such information, but which are packaged within an outer container from which they are removed for dispensing or use, the information required by paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (5) of this section may be contained in other labeling on or within the package from which it is to be so dispensed, and the information referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be placed on such outer container only, and the information required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section may be on the crimp of the dispensing tube.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is advertised or represented; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is advertised or represented; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the article is subject to section 512 or 572 of the act, the labeling bearing such information is the labeling authorized by the approved new animal drug application or contained in the index listing: Provided, however, That the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be omitted from the dispensing package if, but only if, the article is a drug for which directions, hazards, warnings, and use information are commonly known to veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug.

Provided, however, That the information required by paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section is not required on the so-called reminder-piece labeling which calls attention to the name of the drug but does not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All labeling, except labels and cartons, bearing information for use of the drug also bears the date of the issuance or the date of the latest revision of such labeling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A prescription drug intended for both human and veterinary use shall comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and Sec. 201.100.
