                            <p class="depth0">Each claimant for drawback under this subpart agrees in the bond  filed by him that he will furnish, within a reasonable time, evidence  satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer that the tobacco products,  and cigarette papers and tubes covered by his claim have been landed at  some port beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the  United States, or that after shipment from the United States the  articles were lost, and have not been relanded within the limits of the  United States. The landing certificate shall accurately describe the  articles involved, so as to readily identify the drawback claim to which  it relates. The landing certificate shall be signed by a revenue officer  at the place of destination, unless it is shown that no such officer can  furnish such landing certificate, in which case the certificate of  landing shall be signed by the consignee, or by the vessel's agent at  the place of landing, and shall be sworn to before a notary public or  other officer authorized to administer oaths and having an official  seal. The landing certificate shall be filed with the appropriate TTB  officer, with whom the drawback claim was filed, within 6 months from  the date of clearance of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and  tubes from the United States. A landing certificate prepared in a  foreign language shall be accompanied by an accurate translation thereof  in English.  (72 Stat. 1419; 26 U.S.C. 5706)  [T.D. 6871, 31 FR 56, Jan. 4, 1966.
