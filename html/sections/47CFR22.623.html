                            <p class="depth0">This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to- multipoint systems using the channels listed in Sec. 22.621.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 928-960 MHz. The channels may be assigned, individually or  paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least  four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel.  If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942 MHz channel are assigned as a  pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control  transmitters; the 932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or  fixed relay transmitters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 470-512 MHz. These channels may be assigned only individually  (unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least four  public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed  relay transmitters are not authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Selection and assignment. The FCC selects and assigns a channel  when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to  transmit in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges.  Applicants having a preference may request the assignment of a specific  channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to  satisfy such requests.</p>
