EPA is determining that, as of July 21, 1995, the Lewiston-Auburn ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Lewiston-Auburn ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination. EPA is determining that, as of July 21, 1995, the Knox and Lincoln Counties ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard.
