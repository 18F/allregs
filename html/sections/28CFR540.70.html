                            <p class="depth0">Except when precluded by statute (see Sec. 540.72), the Bureau of  Prisons permits an inmate to subscribe to or to receive publications  without prior approval and has established procedures to determine if an  incoming publication is detrimental to the security, discipline, or good  order of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.  The term publication, as used in this subpart, means a book, booklet,  pamphlet, or similar document, or a single issue of a magazine,  periodical, newsletter, newspaper, plus such other   materials addressed to a specific inmate such as advertising brochures,  flyers, and catalogs.
