Total revenues anticipated or received may exceed  the $10 Million Adjusted Limitation in any fiscal year if an exemption  is granted pursuant to Sec. 3035.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each fiscal year, the $10 Million Adjusted Limitation shall  reflect the average CPI result during the previous fiscal year  calculated as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Commission  shall publish this figure annually, after the close of the fiscal year,  on its Web site at http://www.prc.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The calculation of the $10 Million Adjusted Limitation involves  the following steps. First, a simple average CPI-U index was calculated  for fiscal year 2008 by summing the monthly CPI-U values from October  2007 through September 2008 and dividing the sum by 12 (Base Average).  The resulting Base Average is 214.5. Then, a second simple average CPI-U  index is similarly calculated for each subsequent fiscal year by summing  the 12 monthly CPI-U values for the previous fiscal year and dividing  the sum by 12 (Recent Average). Finally, the annual limitation for the  current fiscal year is calculated by multiplying $10,000,000 by the  Recent Average divided by 214.5. The result is expressed as a number,  rounded to the nearest dollar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The formula for calculating the $10 Million Adjusted Limitation  is as follows: $10 Million Adjusted Limitation = $10,000,000 * (Recent  Average/214.5).</p>
