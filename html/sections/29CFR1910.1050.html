(i) If the employer selects the initial physician who conducts any medical examination or consultation provided to an employee under this section, and the employee has signs or symptoms of occupational exposure to MDA (which could include an abnormal liver function test), and the employee disagrees with the opinion of the examining physician, and this opinion could affect the employee's job status, the employee may designate an appropriate, mutually acceptable second physician:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to seek a

second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial physician conducts a medical examination or consultation pursuant to this section. The employer may condition its participation in, and payment for, the multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the foregoing notification, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, whichever is later:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The employee informing the employer that he or she intends to seek a second medical opinion, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employee initiating steps to make an appointment with a second physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the employer and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two physicians to resolve any disagreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the two physicians have been unable to resolve quickly their disagreement, then the employer and the employee through their respective physicians shall designate a third physician;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the prior physicians; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and discussions with the prior physicians as the third physician deems necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The employer shall act consistent with the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the employer and the employee reach an agreement which is otherwise consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the three physicians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Information provided to the examining and consulting physicians. (i) The employer shall provide the following information to the examining physician:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A copy of this regulation and its appendices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee's potential exposure to MDA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The employee's current actual or representative MDA exposure level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of any personal protective equipment used or to be used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Information from previous employment-related medical examinations of the affected employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall provide the foregoing information to a second physician under this section upon request either by the second physician, or by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Physician's written opinion. (i) For each examination under this section, the employer shall obtain, and provide the employee with a copy of, the examining physician's written opinion within 15 days of its receipt. The written opinion shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The occupationally-pertinent results of the medical examination and tests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The physician's opinion concerning whether the employee has any detected medical conditions which would place the employee at increased risk of material impairment of health from exposure to MDA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The physician's recommended limitations upon the employee's exposure to MDA or upon the employee's use of protective clothing or equipment and respirators; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the medical examination and any medical conditions resulting from MDA exposure which require further explanation or treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The written opinion obtained by the employer shall not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Medical removal--(i) Temporary medical removal of an employee--(A) Temporary removal resulting from occupational exposure. The employee shall be removed from work environments in which exposure to MDA is at or above the action level or where dermal exposure to MDA may occur, following an initial examination (paragraph (m)(2) of this section), periodic examinations (paragraph (m)(3) of this section), an emergency situation paragraph (m)(4) of this section, or an additional examination (paragraph (m)(5) of this section) in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the employee exhibits signs and/or symptoms indicative of acute exposure to MDA; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the examining physician determines that an employee's abnormal liver function tests are not associated with MDA exposure but that the abnormalities may be exacerbated as a result of occupational exposure to MDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (1) The employer shall remove an employee from work environments in which exposure to MDA is at or above the action level or where dermal exposure to MDA may occur, on each occasion that there is a final medical determination or opinion that the employee has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``final medical determination'' shall mean the outcome of the physician review mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where a final medical determination results in any recommended special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an employee's exposure to MDA, the employer shall implement and act consistent with the recommendation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer shall return an employee to his or her former job status:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the employee no longer shows signs or symptoms of exposure to MDA, or upon the advice of the physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a subsequent final medical determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Removal of other employee special protective measure or limitations. The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an employee, or end any special protective measures provided to an employee, pursuant to a final medical determination, when a subsequent final medical determination indicates that the limitations or special protective measures are no longer necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where the physician review mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to MDA, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Return. The employer may return the employee to his or her former job status, and end any special protective measures provided to the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status, with two exceptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the employee has been on removal status for the preceding six months as a result of exposure to MDA, then the employer shall await a final medical determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Medical removal protection benefits--(A) Provisions of medical removal protection benefits. The employer shall provide to an employee up to six (6) months of medical removal protection benefits on each occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to MDA or otherwise limited pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide medical removal protection benefits means that the employer shall maintain the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee removal or limitations. During the period of time that an employee is removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited, the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's participation in follow-up medical surveillance made available pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a MDA-related disability, then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for workers' compensation payments received by the employee for treatment-related expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Other credits. The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded compensation program, or receives income from non-MDA-related employment with any employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Employees who do not recover within the 6 months of removal. The employer shall take the following measures with respect to any employee removed from exposure to MDA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall make available to the employee a medical examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical determination with respect to the employee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall assure that the final medical determination obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to his or her former job status, and, if not, what steps should be taken to protect the employee's health;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, or, once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to his or her former job status, the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely returning to his or her former job status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical determination which permits the return of the employee to his or her former job status, despite what would otherwise be an abnormal liver function test, later questions concerning removing the employee again shall be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the MDA removal criteria provided by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an employee from exposure to MDA or otherwise places limitations on an employee due to the effects of MDA exposure on the employee's medical condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (m)(9)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Recordkeeping--(1) Monitoring data for exempted employers. (i) Where as a result of the initial monitoring the processing, use, or handling of products made from or containing MDA are exempted from other requirements of this section under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the employer shall establish and maintain an accurate record of monitoring relied on in support of the exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This record shall include at least the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The product qualifying for exemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The source of the monitoring data (e.g., was monitoring performed by the employer or a private contractor);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The testing protocol, results of testing, and/or analysis of the material for the release of MDA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the operation exempted and how the data support the exemption (e.g., are the monitoring data representative of the conditions at the affected facility); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Other data relevant to the operations, materials, processing, or employee exposures covered by the exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The employer shall maintain this record for the duration of the employer's reliance upon such objective data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Objective data for exempted employers.

Substance Identification</p><p class="depth0">A. Substance: Methylenedianiline (MDA)</p><p class="depth0">B. Permissible Exposure:</p><p class="depth0">1. Airborne: Ten parts per billion parts of air (10 ppb), time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour workday and an action level of five parts per billion parts of air (5 ppb).</p><p class="depth0">2. Dermal: Eye contact and skin contact with MDA are not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">C. Appearance and odor: White to tan solid; amine odor</p><p class="depth0">II. Health Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Ways in which MDA affects your health. MDA can affect your health if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin or eyes. MDA is also harmful if you happen to swallow it. Do not get MDA in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.</p><p class="depth0">B. Effects of overexposure. 1. Short-term (acute) overexposure: Overexposure to MDA may produce fever, chills, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice. Contact may irritate skin, eyes and mucous membranes. Sensitization may occur.</p><p class="depth0">2. Long-term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or prolonged exposure to MDA, even at relatively low concentrations, may cause cancer. In addition, damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and spleen may occur with long term exposure.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reporting signs and symptoms. You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms which you suspect are caused by exposure to MDA including yellow staining of the skin.</p><p class="depth0">III. Protective Clothing and Equipment</p><p class="depth0">A. Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in which engineering controls or work-practice controls are not adequate or feasible to reduce exposure to the permissible limit. If respirators are worn, they must have a label issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 stating that the respirators have been approved for this purpose, and cartridges and canisters must be replaced in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, you can request a positive-pressure respirator from your employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the assigned respirator, and the training must be provided by your employer.</p><p class="depth0">MDA does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the permissible exposure limits. Do not depend on odor to warn you when a respirator canister is exhausted. If you can smell MDA while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Protective Clothing. You may be required to wear coveralls, aprons, gloves, face shields, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin contact with MDA. Where protective clothing is required, your employer is required to provide clean garments to you, as necessary, to assure that the clothing protects you adequately. Replace or repair impervious clothing that has developed leaks.</p><p class="depth0">MDA should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes which are not impervious to MDA should not be allowed to become contaminated with MDA, and if they do, the clothing and shoes should be promptly removed and decontaminated. The clothing should be laundered to remove MDA or discarded. Once MDA penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they should not be worn again.</p><p class="depth0">C. Eye protection. You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas where liquid MDA may contact your eyes. Contact lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact with MDA can occur. In addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed with MDA liquid.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Eye and face exposure. If MDA is splashed into the eyes, wash the eyes for at least 15 minutes. See a doctor as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">B. Skin exposure. If MDA is spilled on your clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large amounts of soap and water immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before you wear it again.</p><p class="depth0">C. Breathing. If you or any other person breathes in large amounts of MDA, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or confined space where the MDA concentration might be high without proper safety equipment and at least one other person present who will stay outside. A life line should be used.</p><p class="depth0">D. Swallowing. If MDA has been swallowed and the patient is conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a doctor immediately.</p><p class="depth0">V. Medical Requirements</p><p class="depth0">If you are exposed to MDA at a concentration at or above the action level for more than 30 days per year, or exposed to liquid mixtures more than 15 days per year, your employer is required to provide a medical examination, including a medical history and laboratory tests, within 60 days of the effective date of this standard and annually thereafter. These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally exposed to MDA (either by ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under conditions known or suspected to constitute toxic exposure to MDA, your employer is required to make special examinations and tests available to you.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Observation of Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to MDA and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you and your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Access to Records</p><p class="depth0">You or your representative are entitled to see the records of measurements of your exposure to MDA upon written request to your employer.

Special Storage and Handling Precautions</p><p class="depth0">A. High exposure to MDA can occur when transferring the substance from one container to another. Such operations should be well ventilated and good work practices must be established to avoid spills.</p><p class="depth0">B. Pure MDA is a solid with a low vapor pressure. Grinding or heating operations increase the potential for exposure.</p><p class="depth0">C. Store away from oxidizing materials.</p><p class="depth0">D. Employers shall advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to MDA could occur.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities</p><p class="depth0">A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary condition.</p><p class="depth0">The employer should institute a leak and spill detection program for operations involving MDA in order to detect sources of fugitive MDA emissions.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be provided and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of MDA from the skin.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Common Operations</p><p class="depth0">Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur include the following: Manufacture of MDA; Manufacture of Methylene diisocyanate; Curing agent for epoxy resin structures; Wire coating operations; and filament winding.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C toSec. 1910.1050--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for MDA</p><p class="depth0">I. Route of Entry</p><p class="depth0">Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or ingested.</p><p class="depth0">II. Toxicology</p><p class="depth0">MDA is a suspect carcinogen in humans. There are several reports of liver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to MDA. A well documented case of

an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to exposure to MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis secondary to MDA are known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause damage to the eyes. Dermatitis and skin sensitization have been observed. Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in humans involve the hepatic parenchyma and produce hepatocellular jaundice. This agent produces intrahepatic cholestasis. The clinical picture consists of cholestatic jaundice, preceded or accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Onset in about 60% of all observed cases is abrupt with severe abdominal pain. In about 30% of observed cases, the illness presented and evolved more slowly and less dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. In about 10% of the cases only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic nature of the jaundice is evident in the prominence of itching, the histologic predominance of bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompanied by only slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderately elevated transaminase values. Acute, high doses, however, have been known to cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.</p><p class="depth0">Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and excreted over a 48-hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the skin, causing dermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not thoroughly removed through washing.</p><p class="depth0">MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting this assumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, human data collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility where MDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposed workers.</p><p class="depth0">III. Signs and Symptoms</p><p class="depth0">Skin may become yellow from contact with MDA.</p><p class="depth0">Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring dermatitis (red-itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin at high concentrations may result in hepatitis, causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, dark urine, anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Corneal burns may occur when MDA is splashed in the eyes.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects/Emergency Situation</p><p class="depth0">If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amounts of water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminated skin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from exposure and given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required under the emergency section of the medical surveillance section (M)(4) must be conducted.</p><p class="depth0">If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove by gastric lavage.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D toSec. 1910.1050--Sampling and Analytical Methods for MDA</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring and Measurement Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure to MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour exposure may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in a random manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling means that any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other. The arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee).</p><p class="depth0">There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposures to MDA. The method OSHA currently uses is included below.</p><p class="depth0">The employer, however, has the obligation of selecting any monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the select PEL.</p><p class="depth0">OSHA Methodology</p><p class="depth0">Sampling Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Apparatus</p><p class="depth0">Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated within 5% of the recommended flow rate with the sampling filter in line.</p><p class="depth0">Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E glass fiber filters treated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each filter with 0.5 mL of 0.26N H2 SO4. (0.26 N H2 SO4 can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N H2 SO4 to 200 mL with deionized water.) The filters are dried in an oven at 100 degrees C for one hour and then assembled into two-piece 37 mm polystyrene cassettes with backup pads. The cassettes are sealed with shrink bands and the ends are plugged with plastic plugs.</p><p class="depth0">After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettes and individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2 mL deionized water. The vials

must be tightly sealed. The water can be added before or after the filters are transferred. The vials must be sealable and capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass scintillation vials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended.</p><p class="depth0">Reagents</p><p class="depth0">Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials.</p><p class="depth0">Sampling Technique</p><p class="depth0">Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the filter cassettes.</p><p class="depth0">Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing and place the cassette in the employee's breathing zone.</p><p class="depth0">After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the filters are transferred to the vials containing deionized water.</p><p class="depth0">At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer the sample filters to vials.</p><p class="depth0">Seal the small vials lengthwise.</p><p class="depth0">Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set.

Instead of using backup pads, blank acid-treated filters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon analysis, the top filters were found to have an average of 91.8% of the spiked amount. There was no MDA found on the bottom filters, so the amount lost was probably due to the slight instability of the MDA salt.</p><p class="depth0">Extraction Efficiency</p><p class="depth0">The average extraction efficiency for six filters spiked at the target concentration is 99.6%.</p><p class="depth0">The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified by reanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards. The average extraction efficiency for the reanalyzed samples is 98.7%.</p><p class="depth0">Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate</p><p class="depth0">The recommended air volume is 100 L.</p><p class="depth0">The recommended sampling rate is 1 L/min.</p><p class="depth0">Interferences (Sampling)</p><p class="depth0">MDI appears to be a positive interference. It was found that when MDI was spiked onto an acid-treated filter, the MDI converted to MDA after air was drawn through it.</p><p class="depth0">Suspected interferences should be reported to the laboratory with submitted samples.</p><p class="depth0">Safety Precautions (Sampling)</p><p class="depth0">Attach the sampling equipment to the employees so that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.</p><p class="depth0">Follow all safety procedures that apply to the work area being sampled.</p><p class="depth0">Analytical Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Apparatus: The following are required for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">A GC equipped with an electron capture detector.

Substance Identification</p><p class="depth0">A. Substance: 1,3-Butadiene (CH2=CH-CH=CH2).</p><p class="depth0">B. Synonyms: 1,3-Butadiene (BD); butadiene; biethylene; bi-vinyl; divinyl; butadiene-1,3; buta-1,3-diene; erythrene; NCI-C50602; CAS-106-99-0.</p><p class="depth0">C. BD can be found as a gas or liquid.</p><p class="depth0">D. BD is used in production of styrene-butadiene rubber and polybutadiene rubber for the tire industry. Other uses include copolymer latexes for carpet backing and paper coating, as well as resins and polymers for pipes and automobile and appliance parts. It is also used as an intermediate in the production of such chemicals as fungicides.</p><p class="depth0">E. Appearance and odor: BD is a colorless, non-corrosive, flammable gas with a mild aromatic odor at standard ambient temperature and pressure.</p><p class="depth0">F. Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed 1 part BD per million parts of air averaged over the 8-hour workday, nor may short-term exposure exceed 5 parts of BD per million parts of air averaged over any 15-minute period in the 8-hour workday.</p><p class="depth0">II. Health Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. BD can affect the body if the gas is inhaled or if the liquid form, which is very cold (cryogenic), comes in contact with the eyes or skin.</p><p class="depth0">B. Effects of overexposure: Breathing very high levels of BD for a short time can cause central nervous system effects, blurred vision, nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood pressure and pulse rate, and unconsciousness. There are no recorded cases of accidental exposures at high levels that have caused death in humans, but this could occur. Breathing lower levels of BD may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Skin contact with liquefied BD can cause irritation and frostbite.</p><p class="depth0">C. Long-term (chronic) exposure: BD has been found to be a potent carcinogen in rodents, inducing neoplastic lesions at multiple target sites in mice and rats. A recent study of BD-exposed workers showed that exposed workers have an increased risk of developing leukemia. The risk of leukemia increases with increased exposure to BD. OSHA has concluded that there is strong evidence that workplace exposure to BD poses an increased risk of death from cancers of the lymphohematopoietic system.</p><p class="depth0">D. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your supervisor if you develop any of these signs or symptoms and suspect that they are caused by exposure to BD.</p><p class="depth0">III. Emergency First Aid Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In the event of an emergency, follow the emergency plan and procedures designated for your work area. If you have been trained in first aid procedures, provide the necessary first aid measures. If necessary, call for additional assistance from co-workers and emergency medical personnel.</p><p class="depth0">A. Eye and Skin Exposures: If there is a potential that liquefied BD can come in contact with eye or skin, face shields and skin protective equipment must be provided and used. If liquefied BD comes in contact with the eye, immediately flush the eyes with large amounts of water, occasionally lifting the lower and the upper lids. Flush repeatedly. Get medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical. In the event of skin contact, which can cause frostbite, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the affected area repeatedly with large amounts of tepid water.</p><p class="depth0">B. Breathing: If a person breathes in large amounts of BD, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you have been trained in this procedure. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediately.</p><p class="depth0">C. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If the exposed person has been overcome, call for help and begin emergency rescue procedures. Use extreme caution so that you do not become a casualty. Understand the plant's emergency rescue procedures and know the locations of rescue equipment before the need arises.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Respirators and Protective Clothing</p><p class="depth0">A. Respirators: Good industrial hygiene practices recommend that engineering and work practice controls be used to reduce environmental concentrations to the permissible exposure level. However, there are some exceptions where respirators may be used to control exposure. Respirators may be used when engineering and work practice controls are not technically feasible, when such controls are in the process of being installed, or when these controls fail and need to be supplemented or during brief, non-routine, intermittent exposure. Respirators may also be used in situations involving non-routine work operations which are performed infrequently and in which exposures are limited in duration, and in emergency situations. In some instances cartridge respirator use is allowed, but only with strict time constraints. For example, at exposure below 5 ppm BD, a cartridge (or canister) respirator, either full or half face, may be used, but the cartridge must be replaced at least every 4 hours, and it must be replaced every 3 hours when the exposure is between 5 and 10 ppm. If the use

of respirators is necessary, the only respirators permitted are those that have been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to respirator selection, a complete respiratory protection program must be instituted which includes regular training, maintenance, fit testing, inspection, cleaning, and evaluation of respirators. If you can smell BD while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air, and change cartridge (or canister) before re-entering an area where there is BD exposure. If you experience difficulty in breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your supervisor.</p><p class="depth0">B. Protective Clothing: Employees should be provided with and required to use impervious clothing, gloves, face shields (eight-inch minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent the skin from becoming frozen by contact with liquefied BD (or a vessel containing liquid BD).</p><p class="depth0">Employees should be provided with and required to use splash-proof safety goggles where liquefied BD may contact the eyes.</p><p class="depth0">V. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage</p><p class="depth0">A. Fire and Explosion Hazards: BD is a flammable gas and can easily form explosive mixtures in air. It has a lower explosive limit of 2%, and an upper explosive limit of 11.5%. It has an autoignition temperature of 420 [deg]C (788 [deg]F). Its vapor is heavier than air (vapor density, 1.9) and may travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back. Usually it contains inhibitors to prevent self-polymerization (which is accompanied by evolution of heat) and to prevent formation of explosive peroxides. At elevated temperatures, such as in fire conditions, polymerization may take place. If the polymerization takes place in a container, there is a possibility of violent rupture of the container.</p><p class="depth0">B. Hazard: Slightly toxic. Slight respiratory irritant. Direct contact of liquefied BD on skin may cause freeze burns and frostbite.</p><p class="depth0">C. Storage: Protect against physical damage to BD containers. Outside or detached storage of BD containers is preferred. Inside storage should be in a cool, dry, well-ventilated, noncombustible location, away from all possible sources of ignition. Store cylinders vertically and do not stack. Do not store with oxidizing material.</p><p class="depth0">D. Usual Shipping Containers: Liquefied BD is contained in steel pressure apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">E. Electrical Equipment: Electrical installations in Class I hazardous locations, as defined in Article 500 of the National Electrical Code, should be in accordance with Article 501 of the Code. If explosion-proof electrical equipment is necessary, it shall be suitable for use in Group B. Group D equipment may be used if such equipment is isolated in accordance with Section 501-5(a) by sealing all conduit \1/2\- inch size or larger. See Venting of Deflagrations (NFPA No. 68, 1994), National Electrical Code (NFPA No. 70, 1996), Static Electricity (NFPA No. 77, 1993), Lightning Protection Systems (NFPA No. 780, 1995), and Fire Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and Volatile Solids (NFPA No. 325, 1994).</p><p class="depth0">F. Fire Fighting: Stop flow of gas. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Fire extinguishers and quick drenching facilities must be readily available, and you should know where they are and how to operate them.</p><p class="depth0">G. Spill and Leak: Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until clean-up has been completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken:</p><p class="depth0">1. Eliminate all ignition sources.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopped in place, remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow the cylinder to empty.</p><p class="depth0">H. Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It is listed as hazardous waste number D001 due to its ignitability. The transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of this waste material must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262, 263, 264, 268 and 270. Disposal can occur only in properly permitted facilities. Check state and local regulation of any additional requirements as these may be more restrictive than federal laws and regulation.</p><p class="depth0">I. You should not keep food, beverages, or smoking materials in areas where there is BD exposure, nor should you eat or drink in such areas.</p><p class="depth0">J. Ask your supervisor where BD is used in your work area and ask for any additional plant safety and health rules.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Medical Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to offer you the opportunity to participate in a medical screening and surveillance program if you are exposed to BD at concentrations exceeding the action level (0.5 ppm BD as an 8-hour TWA) on 30 days or more a year, or at or above the 8 hr TWA (1 ppm) or STEL (5 ppm for 15 minutes) on 10 days or more a year. Exposure for any part of a day counts. If you have had exposure to BD in the past, but have been transferred to another job, you may still be eligible to participate in the medical screening and surveillance program.

The OSHA rule specifies the past exposures that would qualify you for participation in the program. These past exposure are work histories that suggest the following: (1) That you have been exposed at or above the PELs on 30 days a year for 10 or more years; (2) that you have been exposed at or above the action level on 60 days a year for 10 or more years; or (3) that you have been exposed above 10 ppm on 30 days in any past year. Additionally, if you are exposed to BD in an emergency situation, you are eligible for a medical examination within 48 hours. The basic medical screening program includes a health questionnaire, physical examination, and blood test. These medical evaluations must be offered to you at a reasonable time and place, and without cost or loss of pay.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Observation of Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to BD and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Access to Information</p><p class="depth0">A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the information contained in this appendix. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work practices for using BD, emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment.</p><p class="depth0">B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to BD. You or your representative has the right to observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to inform you of the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within permissible exposure limits and of the schedule to implement these actions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at least thirty (30) years.</p><p class="depth0">D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical records to you or your representative upon your request.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B toSec. 1910.1051--Substance Technical Guidelines for 1,3-</p><p class="depth0">Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)</p><p class="depth0">I.

Solubility in water, g/100 g water at 20 [deg]C (68 [deg]F): 0.05.</p><p class="depth0">6. Appearance and odor: Colorless, flammable gas with a mildly aromatic odor. Liquefied BD is a colorless liquid with a mildly aromatic odor.</p><p class="depth0">II. Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Fire:</p><p class="depth0">1. Flash point: -76 [deg]C (-105 [deg]F) for take out; liquefied BD; Not applicable to BD gas.</p><p class="depth0">2. Stability: A stabilizer is added to the monomer to inhibit formation of polymer during storage. Forms explosive peroxides in air in absence of inhibitor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Lower: 2.0; Upper: 11.5.</p><p class="depth0">4. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide for small fires, polymer or alcohol foams for large fires.</p><p class="depth0">5. Special fire fighting procedures: Fight fire from protected location or maximum possible distance. Stop flow of gas before extinguishing fire. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed cylinders cool.</p><p class="depth0">6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: BD vapors are heavier than air and may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Closed containers may rupture violently when heated.</p><p class="depth0">7. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106, BD is classified as a flammable gas. For example, 7,500 ppm, approximately one-fourth of the lower flammable limit, would be considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard.</p><p class="depth0">8. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.155, BD is classified as a Class B fire hazard.</p><p class="depth0">9. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.307, locations classified as hazardous due to the presence of BD shall be Class I.</p><p class="depth0">B. Reactivity:</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions contributing to instability: Heat. Peroxides are formed when inhibitor

concentration is not maintained at proper level. At elevated temperatures, such as in fire conditions, polymerization may take place.</p><p class="depth0">2. Incompatibilities: Contact with strong oxidizing agents may cause fires and explosions. The contacting of crude BD (not BD monomer) with copper and copper alloys may cause formations of explosive copper compounds.</p><p class="depth0">3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases (such as carbon monoxide) may be released in a fire involving BD.</p><p class="depth0">4. Special precautions: BD will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings. BD in storage should be checked for proper inhibitor content, for self-polymerization, and for formation of peroxides when in contact with air and iron. Piping carrying BD may become plugged by formation of rubbery polymer.</p><p class="depth0">C. Warning Properties:</p><p class="depth0">1. Odor Threshold: An odor threshold of 0.45 ppm has been reported in The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Report, Odor Thresholds for Chemicals with Established Occupational Health Standards. (Ex. 32-28C)</p><p class="depth0">2. Eye Irritation Level: Workers exposed to vapors of BD (concentration or purity unspecified) have complained of irritation of eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Dogs and rabbits exposed experimentally to as much as 6700 ppm for 7\1/2\ hours a day for 8 months have developed no histologically demonstrable abnormality of the eyes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Evaluation of Warning Properties: Since the mean odor threshold is about half of the 1 ppm PEL, and more than 10-fold below the 5 ppm STEL, most wearers of air purifying respirators should still be able to detect breakthrough before a significant overexposure to BD occurs.</p><p class="depth0">III. Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken:</p><p class="depth0">1. Eliminate all ignition sources.</p><p class="depth0">2. Ventilate areas of spill or leak.</p><p class="depth0">3. If in liquid form, for small quantities, allow to evaporate in a safe manner.</p><p class="depth0">4. Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopped in place, remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow the cylinder to empty.</p><p class="depth0">B. Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It is listed by the EPA as hazardous waste number D001 due to its ignitability. The transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of this waste material must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262, 263, 264, 268 and 270. Disposal can occur only in properly permitted facilities. Check state and local regulations for any additional requirements because these may be more restrictive than federal laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit (8-hr TWA) or Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL):</p><p class="depth0">1. 8-hr TWA exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this standard are best taken with consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples must be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee).</p><p class="depth0">2. STEL exposure evaluation: Measurements must represent 15 minute exposures associated with operations most likely to exceed the STEL in each job and on each shift.</p><p class="depth0">3.

Monitoring techniques: appendix D describes the validated method of sampling and analysis which has been tested by OSHA for use with BD. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under his or her unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must be accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent for concentrations of BD at or above 1 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 percent for concentrations below 1 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">V. Personal Protective Equipment</p><p class="depth0">A. Employees should be provided with and required to use impervious clothing, gloves, face shields (eight-inch minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent the skin from becoming frozen from contact with liquid BD.</p><p class="depth0">B. Any clothing which becomes wet with liquid BD should be removed immediately and not re-worn until the butadiene has evaporated.</p><p class="depth0">C. Employees should be provided with and required to use splash proof safety goggles where liquid BD may contact the eyes.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of complying with 29 CFR 1910.141, the following items should be emphasized:</p><p class="depth0">A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary condition.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be provided and maintained in a sanitary condition.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Additional Precautions</p><p class="depth0">A. Store BD in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated area and take all necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard.</p><p class="depth0">B. Non-sparking tools must be used to open and close metal containers. These containers must be effectively grounded.</p><p class="depth0">C. Do not incinerate BD cartridges, tanks or other containers.</p><p class="depth0">D. Employers must advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to BD might occur.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C toSec. 1910.1051--Medical Screening and Surveillance for</p><p class="depth0">1,3-Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)</p><p class="depth0">I. Basis for Medical Screening and Surveillance Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A. Route of Entry Inhalation</p><p class="depth0">B. Toxicology</p><p class="depth0">Inhalation of BD has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, damage to the reproductive organs, and fetotoxicity. Butadiene can be converted via oxidation to epoxybutene and diepoxybutane, two genotoxic metabolites that may play a role in the expression of BD's toxic effects.</p><p class="depth0">BD has been tested for carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Both species responded to BD exposure by developing cancer at multiple primary organ sites. Early deaths in mice were caused by malignant lymphomas, primarily lymphocytic type, originating in the thymus.</p><p class="depth0">Mice exposed to BD have developed ovarian or testicular atrophy. Sperm head morphology tests also revealed abnormal sperm in mice exposed to BD; lethal mutations were found in a dominant lethal test. In light of these results in animals, the possibility that BD may adversely affect the reproductive systems of male and female workers must be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Additionally, anemia has been observed in animals exposed to butadiene. In some cases, this anemia appeared to be a primary response to exposure; in other cases, it may have been secondary to a neoplastic response.</p><p class="depth0">C. Epidemiology</p><p class="depth0">Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that BD exposure poses an increased risk of leukemia. Mild alterations of hematologic parameters have also been observed in synthetic rubber workers exposed to BD.</p><p class="depth0">II. Potential Adverse Health Effects</p><p class="depth0">A. Acute</p><p class="depth0">Skin contact with liquid BD causes characteristic burns or frostbite. BD is gaseous form can irritate the eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Blurred vision, coughing, and drowsiness may also occur. Effects are mild at 2,000 ppm and pronounced at 8,000 ppm for exposures occurring over the full workshift.</p><p class="depth0">At very high concentrations in air, BD is an anesthetic, causing narcosis, respiratory paralysis, unconsciousness, and death. Such concentrations are unlikely, however, except in an extreme emergency because BD poses an explosion hazard at these levels.</p><p class="depth0">B. Chronic</p><p class="depth0">The principal adverse health effects of concern are BD-induced lymphoma, leukemia and potential reproductive toxicity. Anemia and other changes in the peripheral blood cells may be indicators of excessive exposure to BD.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reproductive</p><p class="depth0">Workers may be concerned about the possibility that their BD exposure may be affecting their ability to procreate a healthy child. For workers with high exposures to BD, especially those who have experienced difficulties in conceiving, miscarriages, or stillbirths, appropriate medical and laboratory evaluation of fertility may be necessary to determine if BD is having any adverse effect on the reproductive system or on the health of the fetus.</p><p class="depth0">III. Medical Screening Components At-A-Glance</p><p class="depth0">A. Health Questionnaire</p><p class="depth0">The most important goal of the health questionnaire is to elicit information from the worker regarding potential signs or symptoms generally related to leukemia or

other blood abnormalities. Therefore, physicians or other licensed health care professionals should be aware of the presenting symptoms and signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders and cancers, as well as the procedures necessary to confirm or exclude such diagnoses. Additionally, the health questionnaire will assist with the identification of workers at greatest risk of developing leukemia or adverse reproductive effects from their exposures to BD.</p><p class="depth0">Workers with a history of reproductive difficulties or a personal or family history of immune deficiency syndromes, blood dyscrasias, lymphoma, or leukemia, and those who are or have been exposed to medicinal drugs or chemicals known to affect the hematopoietic or lymphatic systems may be at higher risk from their exposure to BD. After the initial administration, the health questionnaire must be updated annually.</p><p class="depth0">B. Complete Blood Count (CBC)</p><p class="depth0">The medical screening and surveillance program requires an annual CBC, with differential and platelet count, to be provided for each employee with BD exposure. This test is to be performed on a blood sample obtained by phlebotomy of the venous system or, if technically feasible, from a fingerstick sample of capillary blood. The sample is to be analyzed by an accredited laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">Abnormalities in a CBC may be due to a number of different etiologies. The concern for workers exposed to BD includes, but is not limited to, timely identification of lymphohematopoietic cancers, such as leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Abnormalities of portions of the CBC are identified by comparing an individual's results to those of an established range of normal values for males and females. A substantial change in any individual employee's CBC may also be viewed as ``abnormal'' for that individual even if all measurements fall within the population-based range of normal values. It is suggested that a flowsheet for laboratory values be included in each employee's medical record so that comparisons and trends in annual CBCs can be easily made.</p><p class="depth0">A determination of the clinical significance of an abnormal CBC shall be the responsibility of the examining physician, other licensed health care professional, or medical specialist to whom the employee is referred. Ideally, an abnormal CBC should be compared to previous CBC measurements for the same employee, when available. Clinical common sense may dictate that a CBC value that is very slightly outside the normal range does not warrant medical concern. A CBC abnormality may also be the result of a temporary physical stressor, such as a transient viral illness, blood donation, or menorrhagia, or laboratory error. In these cases, the CBC should be repeated in a timely fashion, i.e., within 6 weeks, to verify that return to the normal range has occurred. A clinically significant abnormal CBC should result in removal of the employee from further exposure to BD. Transfer of the employee to other work duties in a BD-free environment would be the preferred recommendation.</p><p class="depth0">C. Physical Examination</p><p class="depth0">The medical screening and surveillance program requires an initial physical examination for workers exposed to BD; this examination is repeated once every three years. The initial physical examination should assess each worker's baseline general health and rule out clinical signs of medical conditions that may be caused by or aggravated by occupational BD exposure. The physical examination should be directed at identification of signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders, including lymph node enlargement, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.</p><p class="depth0">Repeated physical examinations should update objective clinical findings that could be indicative of interim development of a lymphohematopoietic disorder, such as lymphoma, leukemia, or other blood abnormality. Physical examinations may also be provided on an as needed basis in order to follow up on a positive answer on the health questionnaire, or in response to an abnormal CBC. Physical examination of workers who will no longer be working in jobs with BD exposure are intended to rule out lymphohematopoietic disorders.</p><p class="depth0">The need for physical examinations for workers concerned about adverse reproductive effects from their exposure to BD should be identified by the physician or other licensed health care professional and provided accordingly. For these workers, such consultations and examinations may relate to developmental toxicity and reproductive capacity.</p><p class="depth0">Physical examination of workers acutely exposed to significant levels of BD should be especially directed at the respiratory system, eyes, sinuses, skin, nervous system, and any region associated with particular complaints. If the worker has received a severe acute exposure, hospitalization may be required to assure proper medical management. Since this type of exposure may place workers at greater risk of blood abnormalities, a CBC must be obtained within 48 hours and repeated at one, two, and three months.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D toSec. 1910.1051--Sampling and Analytical Method for 1,3-</p><p class="depth0">Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)</p><p class="depth0">OSHA Method No.: 56.</p><p class="depth0">Matrix: Air.</p><p class="depth0">Target concentration: 1 ppm (2.21 mg/m\3\)</p><p class="depth0">Procedure: Air samples are collected by drawing known volumes of air through sampling tubes containing charcoal adsorbent which has been coated with 4-tert-butylcatechol.

Background</p><p class="depth0">This work was undertaken to develop a sampling and analytical procedure for BD at 1 ppm. The current method recommended by OSHA for collecting BD uses activated coconut shell charcoal as the sampling medium (Ref. 5.2). This method was found to be inadequate for use at low BD levels because of sample instability.</p><p class="depth0">The stability of samples has been significantly improved through the use of a specially cleaned charcoal which is coated with 4-tert-butylcatechol (TBC). TBC is a polymerization inhibitor for BD (Ref. 5.3).</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 Toxic effects</p><p class="depth0">Symptoms of human exposure to BD include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. It can also cause coughing, drowsiness and fatigue. Dermatitis and frostbite can result from skin exposure to liquid BD. (Ref. 5.1)</p><p class="depth0">NIOSH recommends that BD be handled in the workplace as a potential occupational carcinogen. This recommendation is based on two inhalation studies that resulted in cancers at multiple sites in rats and in mice. BD has also demonstrated mutagenic activity in the presence of a liver microsomal activating system. It has also been reported to have adverse reproductive effects. (Ref. 5.1)</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2. Potential workplace exposure</p><p class="depth0">About 90% of the annual production of BD is used to manufacture styrene-butadiene rubber and Polybutadiene rubber.

Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated to within 5% of the recommended 0.05 L/min sampling rate with the sampling tube in line.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2. Samples are collected with laboratory prepared sampling tubes. The sampling tube is constructed of silane-treated glass and is about 5-cm long. The ID is 4 mm and the OD is 6 mm. One end of the tube is tapered so that a glass wool end plug will hold the contents of the tube in place during sampling. The opening in the tapered end of the sampling tube is at least one-half the ID of the tube (2 mm). The other end of the sampling tube is open to its full 4-mm ID to facilitate packing of the tube. Both ends of the tube are fire-polished for safety. The tube is packed with 2 sections of pretreated charcoal which has been coated with TBC. The tube is packed with a 50-mg backup section, located nearest the tapered end, and with a 100-mg sampling section of charcoal. The two sections of coated adsorbent are separated and retained with small plugs of silanized glass wool. Following packing, the sampling tubes are sealed with two \7/32\ inch OD plastic end caps. Instructions for the pretreatment and coating of the charcoal are presented in Section 4.1 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">2.2. Reagents</p><p class="depth0">None required.</p><p class="depth0">2.3. Technique</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1. Properly label the sampling tube before sampling and then remove the plastic end caps.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.2. Attach the sampling tube to the pump using a section of flexible plastic tubing such that the larger front section of the sampling tube is exposed directly to the atmosphere. Do not place any tubing ahead of the sampling tube. The sampling tube should be attached in the worker's breathing zone in a vertical manner such that it does not impede work performance.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.3. After sampling for the appropriate time, remove the sampling tube from the pump and then seal the tube with plastic end caps. Wrap the tube lengthwise.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.4. Include at least one blank for each sampling set. The blank should be handled in the same manner as the samples with the exception that air is not drawn through it.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.5. List any potential interferences on the sample data sheet.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.6. The samples require no special shipping precautions under normal conditions. The samples should be refrigerated if they are to be exposed to higher than normal ambient temperatures. If the samples are to be stored before they are shipped to the laboratory, they should be kept in a freezer. The samples should be placed in a freezer upon receipt at the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">2.4. Breakthrough</p><p class="depth0">(Breakthrough was defined as the relative amount of analyte found on the backup section of the tube in relation to the total amount of analyte collected on the sampling tube. Five-percent breakthrough occurred after sampling a test atmosphere containing 2.0 ppm BD for 90 min at 0.05 L/min. At the end of this time 4.5 L of air had been sampled and 20.1 [micro]g of the analyte was collected. The relative humidity of the sampled air was 80% at 23 [deg]C.)</p><p class="depth0">Breakthrough studies have shown that the recommended sampling procedure can be used at air concentrations higher than the target concentration. The sampling time, however, should be reduced to 45 min if both the expected BD level and the relative humidity of the sampled air are high.</p><p class="depth0">2.5. Desorption efficiency</p><p class="depth0">The average desorption efficiency for BD from TBC coated charcoal over the range from 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration was 96.4%. The efficiency was essentially constant over the range studied.</p><p class="depth0">2.6. Recommended air volume and sampling rate</p><p class="depth0">2.6.1. The recommended air volume is 3L.</p><p class="depth0">2.6.2. The recommended sampling rate is 0.05 L/min for 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">2.7. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">There are no known interferences to the sampling method.</p><p class="depth0">2.8. Safety precautions</p><p class="depth0">2.8.1.

Standard preparation</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1. Prepare standards by diluting known volumes of BD gas with carbon disulfide. This can be accomplished by injecting the appropriate volume of BD into the headspace above the 1-mL of carbon disulfide contained in sealed 2-mL vial. Shake the vial after the needle is removed from the septum. \6\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ A standard containing 7.71 [micro]g/mL (at ambient temperature and pressure) was prepared by diluting 4 [micro]L of the gas with 1-mL of carbon disulfide.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2. The mass of BD gas used to prepare standards can be determined by use of the following equations:

Results are obtained by use of calibration curves. Calibration curves are prepared by plotting detector response against concentration for each standard. The best line through the data points is determined by curve fitting.</p><p class="depth0">3.7.2. The concentration, in ug/mL, for a particular sample is determined by comparing its detector response to the calibration curve. If any analyte is found on the backup section, this amount is added to the amount found on the front section. Blank corrections should be performed before adding the results together.</p><p class="depth0">3.7.3. The BD air concentration can be expressed using the following equation:

Nitrogen gas, GC grade.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Weigh 30g of charcoal into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add about 250 mL of 10% phosphoric acid to the flask and then swirl the mixture. Stir the mixture for 1 hour using a magnetic stirrer. Filter the mixture using a fitted Buchner funnel. Wash the charcoal several times with 250-mL portions of deionized water to remove all traces of the acid. Transfer the washed charcoal to the tube furnace quartz tube. Place the quartz tube in the furnace and then connect the nitrogen gas purge to the tube. Fire the charcoal to 700 [deg]C. Maintain that temperature for at least 1 hour. After the charcoal has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to a tared beaker. Determine the weight of the charcoal and then add an amount of TBC which is 10% of the charcoal, by weight.</p><p class="depth0">CAUTION-TBC is toxic and should only be handled in a fume hood while wearing gloves.</p><p class="depth0">Carefully mix the contents of the beaker and then transfer the mixture to a 4-oz bottle. Stopper the bottle with a clean rubber stopper which has been wrapped with Teflon tape. Clamp the bottle in a water bath so that the water level is above the charcoal level. Gently heat the bath to 60 [deg]C and then maintain that temperature for 1 hour. Cool the charcoal to room temperature and then transfer the coated charcoal to a suitable container.</p><p class="depth0">The coated charcoal is now ready to be packed into sampling tubes. The sampling tubes should be stored in a sealed container

to prevent contamination. Sampling tubes should be stored in the dark at room temperature. The sampling tubes should be segregated by coated adsorbent lot number.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Chromatograms</p><p class="depth0">The chromatograms were obtained using the recommended analytical method. The chart speed was set at 1 cm/min for the first three min and then at 0.2 cm/min for the time remaining in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">The peak which elutes just before BD is a reaction product between an impurity on the charcoal and TBC. This peak is always present, but it is easily resolved from the analyte. The peak which elutes immediately before benzene is an oxidation product of TBC.</p><p class="depth0">5.
