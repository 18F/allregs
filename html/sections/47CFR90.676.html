The Transition  Administrator may direct that adjoining regions be reconfigured  simultaneously when conditions so require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Transition Administrator will coordinate relocation of a  NPSPAC Region's NPSPAC channels with the relevant Regional Planning  Committee(s) prior to commencing band reconfiguration in a NPSPAC  Region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once band reconfiguration commences in a given NPSPAC Region,  the Transition Administrator will;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitor the retuning schedule and resolve any schedule delays or  refer same to the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, for  resolution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordinate with adjoining NPSPAC Regions to ensure that  interference is not being caused to their existing facilities from  relocated stations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide quarterly progress reports to the Commission in such  detail as the Commission may require and include, with such reports,  certifications by Nextel and the relevant licensees that relocation has  been completed and that both parties agree on the amount received from  the letter of credit proceeds in connection with relocation of the  licensees' facilities.

Sec.  90.615(a), (b) and 90.617(g), (h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Transition Administrator may not serve as the repository of  funds used in band reconfiguration, excepting such sums as Nextel may  pay for the Transition Administrator's services. Moreover, the  Transition Administrator will not be certified by the Commission as a  frequency coordinator.
