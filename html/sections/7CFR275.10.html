                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As part of the Performance Reporting System, each State agency is responsible for conducting quality control reviews. For food stamp quality control reviews, a sample of households shall be selected from two different categories: Households which are participating in the Food Stamp Program (called active cases) and households for which participation was denied, suspended or terminated (called negative cases). Reviews shall be conducted on active cases to determine if households are eligible and receiving the correct allotment of food stamps. The determination of whether the household received the correct allotment will be made by comparing the eligibility data gathered during the review against the amount authorized on the master

issuance file. Reviews of negative cases shall be conducted to determine whether the State agency's decision to deny, suspend or terminate the household, as of the review date, was correct. Quality control reviews measure the validity of food stamp cases at a given time (the review date) by reviewing against the Food Stamp Program standards established in the Food Stamp Act and the Regulations, taking into account any FNS authorized waivers to deviate from specific regulatory provisions. FNS and the State agency shall analyze findings of the reviews to determine the incidence and dollar amounts of errors, which will determine the State agency's liability for payment errors in accordance with the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, and to plan corrective action to reduce excessive levels of errors for any State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The objectives of quality control reviews are to provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A systematic method of measuring the validity of the food stamp caseload;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A basis for determining error rates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A timely continuous flow of information on which to base corrective action at all levels of administration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A basis for establishing State agency liability for errors that exceed the National performance measure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The review process is the activity necessary to complete reviews and document findings of all cases selected in the sample for quality control reviews. The review process shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Case assignment and completion monitoring;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Case reviews;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Supervisory review of completed worksheets and schedules; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transmission of completed worksheets and schedules to the State agency for centralized data compilation and analysis.
