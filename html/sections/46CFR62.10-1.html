Typical failsafe  states are listed in Table 62.10-1(a).</p><p class="depth2">Table 62.10-1(a)--Typical Failsafe States ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">System or component               Preferred failsafe state ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cooling water valve.......................
