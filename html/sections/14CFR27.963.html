                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each fuel tank must be able to withstand, without failure, the vibration, inertia, fluid, and structural loads to which it may be subjected in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each fuel tank of 10 gallons or greater capacity must have internal baffles, or must have external support to resist surging.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each fuel tank must be separated from the engine compartment by a firewall. At least one-half inch of clear airspace must be provided between the tank and the firewall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Spaces adjacent to the surfaces of fuel tanks must be ventilated so that fumes cannot accumulate in the tank compartment in case of leakage. If two or more tanks have interconnected outlets, they must be considered as one tank, and the airspaces in those tanks must be interconnected to prevent the flow of fuel from one tank to another as a result of a difference in pressure between those airspaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The maximum exposed surface temperature of any component in the fuel tank must be less, by a safe margin as determined by the Administrator, than the lowest expected autoignition temperature of the fuel or fuel vapor in the tank. Compliance with this requirement must be shown under all operating conditions and under all failure or malfunction conditions of all components inside the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each fuel tank installed in personnel compartments must be isolated by fume-proof and fuel-proof enclosures that are drained and vented to the exterior of the rotorcraft. The design and construction of the enclosures must provide necessary protection for the

tank, must be crash resistant during a survivable impact in accordance with Sec. 27.952, and must be adequate to withstand loads and abrasions to be expected in personnel compartments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each flexible fuel tank bladder or liner must be approved or shown to be suitable for the particular application and must be puncture resistant. Puncture resistance must be shown by meeting the TSO-C80, paragraph 16.0, requirements using a minimum puncture force of 370 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each integral fuel tank must have provisions for inspection and repair of its interior.
