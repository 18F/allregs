                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and  cholesterol and that include soy protein and the risk of CHD. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory  system. CHD is one of the most common and serious forms of  cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and  supporting blood vessels. High blood total cholesterol and low density  lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk  of developing CHD. High CHD rates occur among people with high total  cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21  millimole per liter (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160  mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk total cholesterol  levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159  mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. The scientific evidence  establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are  associated with increased levels of blood total and LDL-cholesterol and,  thus, with increased risk of CHD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Populations with a low incidence of CHD tend to have relatively  low blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. These  populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in  total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also  relatively high in plant foods that contain dietary fiber and other  components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat  and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD. Other evidence demonstrates  that the addition of soy protein to a diet that is low in saturated fat  and cholesterol may also help to reduce the risk of CHD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Significance of the relationship between diets that are low in  saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soy protein and the risk  of CHD. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CHD is a major public health concern in the United States.  It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases.  Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal  that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL- cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in the diets  of many people in the United States. One of the major public health  recommendations relative to CHD risk is to consume less than 10 percent  of calories from saturated fat and an average of 30 percent or less of  total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are  300 mg or less per day. Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low  in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with lower blood total  and LDL-cholesterol levels. Soy protein, when included in a low  saturated fat and cholesterol diet, also helps to lower blood total and  LDL-cholesterol levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All requirements set forth in Sec. 101.14  shall be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific requirements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nature of the claim. A health claim  associating diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that  include soy protein with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on  the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of  this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The claim states that diets that are low in saturated fat and  cholesterol and that include soy protein ``may'' or ``might'' reduce the  risk of heart disease;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms:  ``heart disease'' or ``coronary heart disease'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In specifying the substance, the claim uses the term ``soy  protein'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In specifying the fat component, the claim uses the terms  ``saturated fat'' and ``cholesterol'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The claim does not attribute any degree of risk reduction for  CHD to diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that  include soy protein;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The claim does not imply that consumption of diets that are low  in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soy protein is the  only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of CHD; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> The claim specifies the daily dietary intake of soy protein that  is necessary to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and the  contribution one serving of the product makes to the specified daily  dietary intake level. The daily dietary intake level of soy protein that  has been associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease is 25  grams (g) or more per day of soy protein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nature of the substance. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Soy protein from the legume seed  Glycine max.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> FDA will assess qualifying levels of soy protein in the  following fashion: FDA will measure total protein content by the  appropriate method of analysis given in the ``Official Methods of  Analysis of the AOAC International,'' as described at Sec. 101.9(c)(7).  For products that contain no sources of protein other than soy, FDA will  consider the amount of soy protein as equivalent to the total protein  content. For products that contain a source or sources of protein in  addition to soy, FDA will, using the measurement of total protein  content, calculate the soy protein content based on the ratio of soy  protein ingredients to total protein ingredients in the product. FDA  will base its calculation on information identified and supplied by  manufacturers, such as nutrient data bases or analyses, recipes or  formulations, purchase orders for ingredients, or any other information  that reasonably substantiates the ratio of soy protein to total protein.  Manufacturers must maintain records sufficient to substantiate the claim  for as long as the products are marketed and provide these records, on  written request, to appropriate regulatory officials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nature of the food eligible to bear the claim. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The food  product shall contain at least 6.25 g of soy protein per reference  amount customarily consumed of the food product;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The food shall meet the nutrient content requirements in  Sec. 101.62 for a ``low saturated fat'' and ``low cholesterol'' food;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The food shall meet the nutrient content requirement in  Sec. 101.62 for a ``low fat'' food, unless it consists of or is derived  from whole soybeans and contains no fat in addition to the fat  inherently present in the whole soybeans it contains or from which it is  derived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optional information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claim may state that the  development of heart disease depends on many factors and may identify  one or more of the following risk factors for heart disease about which  there is general scientific agreement: A family history of CHD; elevated  blood total and LDL-cholesterol; excess body weight; high blood  pressure; cigarette smoking; diabetes; and physical inactivity. The  claim may also provide additional information about the benefits of  exercise and management of body weight to help lower the risk of heart  disease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claim may state that the relationship between intake of  diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soy  protein and reduced risk of heart disease is through the intermediate  link of ``blood cholesterol'' or ``blood total and LDL-cholesterol'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section, which summarize the relationship between diets that are  low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soy protein and  CHD and the significance of the relationship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The claim may state that a diet low in saturated fat and  cholesterol that includes soy protein is consistent with ``Nutrition and  Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),  Government Printing Office (GPO);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The claim may state that individuals with elevated blood total  and LDL-cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice  and treatment. If the claim defines high or normal blood total and LDL- cholesterol levels, then the claim shall state that individuals with  high blood cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical  advice and treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The claim may include information on the number of people in the  United States who have heart disease. The sources of this information  shall be identified, and it shall be current information from the  National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of  Health, or ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for  Americans,'' USDA and DHHS, GPO;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Model health claim. The following model health claims may be  used in food labeling to describe the relationship between diets that  are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soy protein  and reduced risk of heart disease:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in  saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A  serving of [name of food] supplies ---- grams of soy protein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams  of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving  of [name of food] provides ---- grams of soy protein.  [64 FR 57732, Oct. 26, 1999]</p><p class="depth3">Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 57732, Oct. 26, 1999, Sec. 101.82 was  added. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) contains information collection and  recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval  has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
