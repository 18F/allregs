Any claim for a relocation payment must be  supported by such documentation as may be required to support the claim,  for example the length of occupancy at the displacement dwelling, the  rent paid at the displacement dwelling, expenses incurred in relocating,  etc. A displaced person must be provided reasonable assistance to  complete and file any required claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for Filing.

The certification that the claimant has occupied decent, safe, and  sanitary housing must be completed prior to final payment of replacement  housing payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relocation Payments Not Considered as Income. Upon approval of  the claim and delivery of the relocation payment, the displaced person  must be advised that no relocation payment made under these procedures  shall be considered as income for the purpose of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954, or for the purpose of determining the eligibility or the  extent of eligibility of any person for assistance under the Social  Security Act or any other Federal Law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification. Certification that a person is displaced will be  provided any agency requiring such information to assist that person  under any Federal law or program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Advance of Funds. If the displaced person cannot arrange for the  acquisition of a replacement property because of financial problems and  the problems would be solved by an advance of funds, the Postal Service  may determine the estimated amount of the actual claim and authorize an  advance of that amount or a portion thereof. The displaced person will  be fully informed in writing that his or her final claim will then be  subject to adjustment. Advance payments should not be made to persons  with a history of financial irresponsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Money Owed to the Postal Service. In cases of Postal Service  leasing the acquired property to a displaced persons, or in cases of  advance moving cost payments, any monies due the Postal Service by the  displaced person and not paid before the remainder of the relocation  payments are made must be deducted from such payments and the relocation  file so documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notice of Denial of Claim. If the Postal Service disapproves all  or part of a payment claimed, of refuses to consider the claim on its  merits because of untimely filing or other grounds, it must promptly  notify the claimant in writing of the determination, the basis for the  determination, and the procedures for appealing the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Appeal Procedure. If a displaced person wishes to file an  appeal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appeal must be in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The appeal must be directed to the General Manager, Real Estate  Division, and must set forth the displaced person's reasons for the  appeal. (The General Manager shall not have taken part in the decision  which led to the appeal. Appeals misdirected to others must be forwarded  immediately to the General Manager with notification of the forwarding  to the appellant.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appeal must be submitted within 60 days after the displaced  person receives written notification of the Postal Service's original  determination concerning the displacee's claim. The Postal Service may  extend this time limit for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Right of Representation. A displaced person has a right to be  represented by legal counsel or other representative in connection with  his or her appeal, but solely at the person's own expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Review of Files by Appellant. The Postal Service must permit a  person to inspect and copy all materials pertinent to his or her appeal,  except materials which are confidential. Such inspection will be  permitted as allowed under the Freedom of Information Act, 39 CFR Part  265.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Scope of Review. In deciding an appeal, the Postal Service must  consider all pertinent justification and other material submitted by the  displaced person and all other available information that is needed to  ensure a fair and full review of the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Determination and Notification After Appeal. Promptly after  receipt of all supporting information submitted by the appellant, the  General Manager, Real Estate Division, must make a written determination  on the appeal, including the basis on which the decision was made, and  furnish the appellant a copy. If the full relief requested is not  granted at the Service Center level, the General Manager, Real Estate  Division, must advise the person of his or her right to appeal the  decision to the Director, Office of Real Estate. The rules stated here  for appeals to the General Manager apply as well as to appeals to the  Director, Office of Real Estate.
