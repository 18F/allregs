                            <p class="depth0">Payment for a procedure identified by a HCPCS/CPT code shall not  exceed the amount derived by multiplying the relative values for that  procedure by the geographic indices for services in that area and by the  dollar amount assigned to one unit in that category of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ``locality'' which serves as a basis for the determination  of average cost is defined by the Bureau of Census Metropolitan  Statistical Areas. OWCP shall base the determination of the relative per  capita cost of medical care in a locality using information about  enrollment and medical cost per county, provided by the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OWCP shall assign the relative value units (RVUs) published by  CMS to all services for which CMS has made assignments, using the most  recent revision. Where there are no RVUs assigned to a procedure, OWCP  may develop and assign any RVUs considered appropriate. The geographic  adjustment factor shall be that designated by Geographic Practice Cost  Indices for Metropolitan Statistical Areas as devised for CMS and as  updated or revised by CMS from time to time. OWCP will devise conversion  factors for each category of service, and in doing so may adapt CMS  conversion factors as appropriate using OWCP's processing experience and  internal data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For example, if the unit values for a particular surgical  procedure are 2.48 for physician's work (W), 3.63 for practice expense  (PE), and 0.48 for malpractice insurance (M), and the dollar value  assigned to one unit in that category of service (surgery) is $61.20,  then the maximum allowable charge for one performance of that procedure  is the product of the three RVUs times the corresponding geographical  indices for the locality times the conversion factor. If the geographic  indices for the locality are 0.988(W), 0.948 (PE), and 1.174 (M), then  the maximum payment calculation is:  [(2.48)(0.988) + (3.63)(0.948) + (0.48)(1.174)] x $61.20 [2.45 + 3.44 + .56] x $61.20 6.45 x $61.20 = $394.74</p>
