For purposes of this section, a nonthrift's tentative  taxable income (or loss) is its separate taxable income (determined  under Sec. 1.1502-12), adjusted for the portion of the consolidated net  operating loss deduction attributable to the member, the portion of the  consolidated net capital loss carryover or carryback attributable to the  member, and further adjusted as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments for all members.

A thrift's separate  taxable income (as adjusted under paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is  reduced (but not below zero) by losses of thrifts and to the extent  attributable to functionally related activities, losses of a nonthrift.  Certain operating rules for determining the amount of the reductions are  provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. The reductions are made in  the following amounts in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph  (h)(2) of this section) of another thrift's tentative taxable loss. That  tentative taxable loss is determined by including a deduction under  section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for the year in which  the loss arises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph  (h)(3) of this section) of the portion of the consolidated net operating  loss deduction attributable to it or another thrift. That consolidated  net operating loss deduction is determined by including a deduction  under section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for the year in  which the loss arose. The portion of a consolidated net operating loss  deduction attributable to another thrift is computed by excluding losses  arising in taxable years for which the due date   (without extensions) for filing returns is before March 15, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph  (h)(4) of this section) of the loss attributable to functionally related  activities of a nonthrift (as determined under paragraph (g) of this  section).

This increase is the amount of the  thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph (h)(6) of this  section) of the income attributable to functionally related activities  of a nonthrift in a consolidated return year and is made only in that  year. This increase is made only if both the thrift and the nonthrift  were members of the group in the consolidated return years in which both  the reduction and increase are made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> limits the increases to a thrift's  separate taxable income to assure that income of a particular nonthrift  is used to restore reductions of a thrift only to the extent that such  nonthrift's losses reduced the thrift's income. Therefore, as of the end  of a consolidated return year, the cumulative increases to a thrift's  tentative taxable income (by reason of income attributable to  functionally related activities of a nonthrift) may not exceed the  cumulative reductions to the thrift's separate taxable income made (by  reason of the nonthrift's functionally related activities) under  paragraph (f)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section in the current and all  prior consolidated return years during which both the thrift institution  and the nonthrift institution were members of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a netting rule, see paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special Rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a carryback to a thrift's separate taxable  income diminishes the reduction to a thrift's separate taxable income  for a prior consolidated return year otherwise required by paragraph  (f)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this section, then any increases to a thrift's  separate taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for an  intervening consolidated return year must be recomputed to take into  account the effect of such carryback. Thus, if a net operating loss  attributable to a thrift is carried back and completely offsets the  thrift's separate taxable income (before the reductions under paragraph  (f)(1) (iii) or (iv) or this section), any increase to the thrift's  separate taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section  (attributable to a reduction in the year to which the loss is carried)  for an intervening consolidated return year will be eliminated. The  recomputation required by this subparagraph (3) must be reflected on an  amended return for the intervening consolidated return year for which  the increase was previously reported. See example (2) in paragraph (j)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a deficiency for an intervening consolidated return year  results from the application of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section with  respect to an item to which section 6501(h) applies, the deficiency may  be assessed at any time within the period described in section 6501(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of chapter 67 of the Code (relating to interest),  the last date prescribed for payment of any tax owed as a result of the  application of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section is   deemed to be the last day of the taxable year for which the item carried  back arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operating rules. For purposes of paragraphs (d) through (j) of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The portion of a consolidated net operating loss deduction  attributable to a member is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First, determine under Secs. 1.1502-21(b) (or Sec. 1.1502- 79A(a)(3), as appropriate) the portion of each consolidated net  operating loss attributable to the member for the particular year in  which the loss arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Second, apply the anti-double-counting rule in paragraph  (h)(3)(iii) of this section so as not to take the same loss into account  twice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Finally, apply the loss absorption limit in paragraph  (f)(4)(iii) of this section to the total amount of the consolidated net  operating loss deduction from a particular loss year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capital loss carryovers and carrybacks shall be taken into  account in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraphs (d)  through (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> prescribes a loss absorption limit. The  total amount of the consolidated net operating loss deduction from a  given year (loss year) taken into account as reductions under paragraph  (f)(1) of this section for another year (absorption year) shall not  exceed the amount of the consolidated net operating loss deduction  attributable to the loss year absorbed in computing consolidated taxable  income for the absorption year. For this purpose, consolidated taxable  income for the absorption year shall include a deduction under section  593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for each thrift member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this section to reduce a  thrift's tentative taxable income, but:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Only if the income year is not later than the loss year and the  reduction year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only to the extent the income had not previously been taken into  account under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or this subdivision (iv)  as of the close of the later of the loss year and the reduction year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Income (or loss) attributable to functionally related activities  of a nonthrift--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the income  (or loss) attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift  is the income (or loss) of the nonthrift:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Attributable to the provision of assets or the rendition of  services to a thrift (such as the leasing of office space or providing  computer or financial services), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Derived from the assets described in section 7701(a)(19)(C)  (iii) through (x), but only if such assets comprise 5 percent or more of  the gross assets of the nonthrift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of income (or loss).The amount of income (or loss) from  such activities is the excess of (i) gross income from such activities  over (ii) the deductions of the nonthrift allocable and apportionable to  that gross income under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8. The loss  attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is the  excess (if any) of such deductions over such gross income. That loss,  however, may not exceed the amount of the tentative taxable loss of that  nonthrift (determined by excluding losses arising in taxable years for  which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is before  March 15, 1983).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)(2)</em> through (5) of this section provides rules for allocating  different losses among thrifts that have tentative taxable income  greater than zero. Generally, these allocations are made in the order  listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and are based upon the  relative tentative taxable income of the thrifts to which the particular  loss is allocated. For purposes of each allocation under a subdivision  of such paragraph (f)(1), the   tentative taxable income of the thrifts used in making this allocation  is reduced by the thrift's allocable share of losses allocated to the  thrift under a prior subdivision of such paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. Accordingly,  for purposes of this paragraph (h), tentative taxable income is  determined without regard to paragraph (f) of this section, except as  otherwise provided. Paragraph (h)(6) of this section provides rules for  allocating income attributable to functionally related activities of a  nonthrift based upon the relative reductions to thrift income made on  account of that nonthrift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of tentative taxable loss of other thrifts. For  purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, a thrift's allocable  share of another thrift's tentative taxable loss is the loss multiplied  by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the tentative taxable  income (if greater than zero) of the thrift, and the denominator is the  aggregate of such tentative taxable income of each thrift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation of portions of a consolidated net operating loss  deduction. (i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a  first thrift's allocable share of the portion of the consolidated net  operating loss deduction attributable to another thrift is determined  under paragraph (h)(2) of this section as if that portion were a  tentative taxable loss of that other thrift and by computing tentative  taxable income under such paragraph (h)(2) by taking into account  paragraph (f)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section. A thrift's allocable share of the  portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction attributable to  that thrift is equal to that entire portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, and (iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> prevents the ``double-counting'' of  losses. The reduction to the tentative taxable income of a thrift is  diminished to the extent the loss that gave rise to the reduction has  previously been taken into account in reducing a thrift's tentative  taxable income. Thus, any loss taken into account as a reduction to a  thrift's separate taxable income under any subdivision of paragraph  (f)(1) of this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the  extent taken into account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In a prior consolidated return year under any subdivision of  such paragraph (f)(1) or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the current consolidated return year under a previous  subdivision of such paragraph (f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of loss attributable to functionally related  activities of a nonthrift. For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this  section, a thrift's allocable share of a loss attributable to  functionally related activities of a nonthrift is determined by  multiplying the loss by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the  tentative taxable income (if greater than zero) of the thrift (taking  into account paragraph (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section) and the  denominator is the aggregate of such tentative taxable income (so  determined) of each thrift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction  attributable to functionally related activities of a particular  nonthrift. The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction  attributable to functionally related activities of a particular  nonthrift is the lesser of the following two amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction  attributable to that nonthrift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate of the losses attributable to functionally  related activities of that nonthrift for the taxable years in which the  consolidated net operating loss deduction arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of income attributable to functionally related  activities of a nonthrift. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)   of this section, a thrift institution's allocable share of the income  attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is  determined by multiplying that income by a fraction. The numerator of  the fraction is the amount of the cumulative reductions referred to in  paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section (minus the cumulative increases  under paragraph (f)(2) of this section) made on account of that  nonthrift for the thrift and the denominator is the sum of such  cumulative reductions (minus such cumulative increases) made on account  of that nonthrift for all thrifts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Proper accounting The provisions of section 482 apply in  determining a thrift institution's tentative taxable income, and in  determining the gross income and deductions attributable to functionally  related activities. For example, an expense such as the salary of an  individual who performs services for both a thrift and a nonthrift must  be allocated in a manner that fairly reflects the value of the services  rendered to each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples. In each example the letter ``T'' for a member  denotes a thrift and the letters ``NT'' denote a nonthrift. Also, in  each example, a thrift loss includes a bad debt deduction under section  593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for such year and a thrift  with income would have such a bad debt deduction of zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In 1983, corporations T1, T2, NT1, and NT2 are  formed. These corporations constitute an affiliated group that files a  consolidated return on the basis of a calendar year. For 1983, 1984, and  1985, the tentative taxable income (or loss) of each member (before the  application of paragraph (f) of this section) is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1983     1984     1985 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ NT1...........................................   $(60)    $(140)     $15 T1............................................   1,000       500     750 NT2...........................................

For 1983 and 1984, T1's tentative taxable  income was reduced by a total of $138 (i.e., $60 + $78) due to NT1's  losses from functionally related activities. For 1984, T2's tentative  taxable income was reduced by $62 due to those losses. Accordingly,  under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, T1's tentative taxable income  for 1983 is increased by $10 (i.e., $15x$138/($138+$62)) and T2's  tentative taxable income is increased by $5 (i.e., $15x$62/($138+$62)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In 1983, corporations T, NT1, and NT2 are formed.  these corporations constitute an affiliated group.

In addition,  under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the group must file an  amended return for 1984 to eliminate the increase to T's bad debt  deduction for 1984 by reason of the consolidated net operating loss  carryback to 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> T and NT are formed in 1983 and are the only members  of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return on a calendar year  basis.

However, T's tentative taxable income for  1983 is not reduced under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, since,  under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, NT's 1984 income  attributable to functionally related activities of $40 is netted against  that $40 carryback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In 1983, corporations T1, T2, NT1, and NT2 are  formed.

T1's remaining tentative taxable income of $10 is reduced to  zero, under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, by NT1's 1984  tentative taxable loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For 1985, the only thrift with tentative taxable income greater  than zero (before applying paragraph (f) of this section) is T1. T1's  tentative taxable income for 1985 of $30 is reduced to $5 by T2's 1985  loss of $25 under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Next, the  portions attributable to T1 and T2 of the consolidated net operating  loss carryover from 1983 to 1985 for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of  this section must be determined. That determination is made without  applying the rules for loss absorption in computing consolidated taxable  income under Sec. 1.1502-21A(b)(3). Those portions are instead  determined in 3 steps under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. The  first of those steps is to determine each of T1's and T2's attributable  portions of the 1983 consolidated net operating loss which under  Sec. 1.1502-79A (a)(3) is $10 or $20 for both thrifts. The second of  those steps is to apply the anti-double counting rule under paragraph  (h)(3)(iii) of this section to reduce that $20 amount by the $10 total  of the two $5 portions attributable to T1 and T2 of the consolidated net  operating loss carryover from 1983 to 1984 taken into account as  reductions to T1's tentative taxable income for 1984 under paragraph  (f)(1)(ii) of this section. That leaves a $10   total amount available to be taken into account as reductions to T1's  remaining tentative taxable income of $5 for 1985 under paragraph  (f)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the third of those steps that $10  amount, however, is limited, under the loss absorption limit of  paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, to the $6 of the 1983  consolidated net operating loss carryover to 1985 which is absorbed in  computing consolidated taxable income for 1985 since 1985 consolidated  taxable income available for absorption after a bad debt deduction under  section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for that year is $6  (i.e., $30+$100-$99-$25). Because separate taxable income cannot be  reduced below zero under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, T1's  remaining tentative taxable income of $5 is thus reduced to zero by the  portions attributable to T1 and T2, respectively, of the consolidated  net operating loss carryover from 1983 to 1985 under paragraph  (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
