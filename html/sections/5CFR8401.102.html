                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition. Except as provided in this section, no employee (other than a special Government employee), or spouse or minor child of such an employee, shall have a financial interest, including compensated employment or indebtedness, in any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Federal Mine Safety and Health Act), 30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. (1) This section does not prohibit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from investing in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund which, in its prospectus, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in the securities of any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, provided that the employee neither:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section does not prohibit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from investing in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund which, in its prospectus, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in the securities of any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, provided that the employee neither:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exercises control over the financial interests held in the fund; nor</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Unless divestiture is required by paragraph (c) of this section, this section does not prohibit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from owning or controlling securities of any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, whenever:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unless divestiture is required by paragraph (c) of this section, this section does not prohibit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from owning or controlling securities of any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, whenever:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ownership or control was acquired prior to the employee's commencement of employment, through a change in marital status, or through circumstances beyond the employee's control and without the appearance of attempting to circumvent the prohibitions in this section, such as acquisition by inheritance, gift, or merger, acquisition or other change in corporate ownership, provided that: (1) The employee makes full, written disclosure to the designated agency ethics official within 30 days after the security is acquired or the employment is commenced; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employee is disqualified from participating in any decision, examination, audit, or other particular matter having a direct and predictable effect on such company or other person, in which the employee holds a direct or indirect interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The securities result from a stock split, stock dividend or the exercise of preemptive rights arising out of securities permitted by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. This paragraph does not permit the holding of stocks purchased through voluntary reinvestment of cash dividends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``securities'' includes all interests in debt or equity instruments. The term includes, without limitation, secured and unsecured bonds, debentures, notes, securitized assets and commercial paper, as well as all types of preferred and common stock. The term encompasses both current and contingent ownership interests, including any beneficial or legal interest derived from a

trust. It extends to any right to acquire or dispose of any long or short position in such securities and includes, without limitation, interests convertible into such securities, as well as options, rights, warrants, puts, calls, and straddles with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Divestiture. The designated agency ethics official may require an employee to divest a security the employee is otherwise authorized to retain under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, based on a determination of substantial conflict under Sec. 2635.403(b) of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Waivers. The designated agency ethics official may grant a written waiver from the prohibition contained in this section based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which Commission programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may be accompanied by appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written statement of disqualification. Notwithstanding the grant of any waiver, an employee remains subject to the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 and 2635.502.</p>
