                            <p class="depth0">You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any  individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the  affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected  source. You must use either the compliant material option or the  emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation(s)  in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To  demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on  controls option, the coating operation(s) must meet the applicable  emission limit in Sec. 63.4090 but not the operating limits or work  practice standards in Sec. Sec. 63.4092 and 63.4093, respectively,  during the initial compliance period. You must meet all of the  requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the  applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090 for the coating operation(s).  When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this  section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials  used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material  option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need  to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or  cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the  coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate without add-on  controls option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determine the volume of each material used during the compliance  period.

The mass of organic HAP emissions is the combined  mass of organic HAP contained in all coatings, thinners, and cleaning  materials used during the compliance period minus the organic HAP in  certain waste materials.
