                                Sec. 225.115  Applicability of Bank Service Corporation Act in
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Questions have been presented to the Board of Governors  regarding the applicability of the recently enacted Bank Service  Corporation Act (Pub. L. 87-856, approved October 23, 1962) in cases  involving service corporations that are subsidiaries of bank holding  companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. In addition to  being charged with the administration of the latter Act, the Board is  named in the Bank Service Corporation Act as the Federal supervisory  agency with respect to the performance of bank services for State member  banks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Holding company-owned corporation serving only subsidiary banks.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One question is whether the Bank Service Corporation Act is  applicable in the case of a corporation, wholly owned by a bank holding  company, which is engaged in performing ``bank services'', as defined in  section 1(b) of the Act, exclusively for subsidiary banks of the holding  company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as noted below with respect to section 5 thereof, the  Bank Service Corporation Act is not applicable in this case. This is  true because none of the stock of the corporation performing the  services is owned by any bank and the corporation, therefore, is not a  ``bank service corporation'' as defined in section 1(c) of the Act. A  corporation cannot meet that definition unless part of its stock is  owned by two or more banks. The situation clearly is unaffected by  section 2(b) of the Act which permits a corporation that fell within the  definition initially to continue to function as a bank service  corporation although subsequently only one of the banks remains as a  stockholder in the corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> However, although it is not a bank service corporation, the  corporation in question and each of the banks for which it performs bank  services are subject to section 5 of the Bank Service Corporation Act.  That section, which requires the furnishing of certain assurances to the  appropriate Federal supervisory agency in connection with the  performance of bank services for a bank, is applicable whether such  services are performed by a bank service corporation or by others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 4(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the  acquisition by a bank holding company of ``direct or indirect ownership  or control'' of shares of a nonbanking company, subject to certain  exceptions. Section 4(c)(1) of the Act exempts from section 4(a)(1)  shares of a company engaged ``solely in the business of furnishing  services to or performing services for'' its bank holding company or  subsidiary banks thereof. Assuming that the bank services performed by  the corporation in question are ``services'' of the kinds contemplated  by section 4(c)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act (as would be true,  for example, of the electronic data processing of deposit accounts), the  holding company's ownership of the corporation's shares in the situation  described above clearly is permissible under that section of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bank service corporation owned by holding company subsidiaries  and serving also other banks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The other question concerns the  applicability of the Bank Service Corporation Act and the Bank Holding  Company Act in the case of a corporation, all the stock of which is  owned either by a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks together  or by the subsidiary banks alone, which is engaged in performing ``bank  services'', as defined in section 1(b) of the Bank Service Corporation  Act, for the subsidiary banks and for other banks, as well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In contrast to the situation under paragraph (b) of this  section, the corporation in this case is a ``bank service corporation''  within the meaning of section 1(c) of the Bank Service Corporation Act  because of the ownership by each of the subsidiary banks of a part of  the corporation's stock. This stock ownership is one of the important  facts differentiating this case from the first one. Being a bank service  corporation, the corporation in question is subject to section 3 of the  Act concerning applications to bank service corporations by competitive  banks for bank services, and to section 4 forbidding a bank service  corporation from engaging in any activity other than the performance of  bank services   for banks. Section 5, mentioned previously and relating to  ``assurances'', also is applicable in this case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The other important difference between this case and the  situation in paragraph (b) of this section is that here the bank service  corporation performs services for nonsubsidiary banks, as well as for  subsidiary banks. This is permissible because section 2(a) of the Bank  Service Corporation Act, which authorizes any two or more banks to  invest limited amounts in a bank service corporation, removes all  limitations and prohibitions of Federal law exclusively relating to  banks that otherwise would prevent any such investment. From the  legislative history of section 2(a), it is clear that section 6 of the  Bank Holding Company Act is among the limitations and prohibitions so  removed. But for such removal, section 6(a)(1) of that Act would make it  unlawful for any of the subsidiary banks of the bank holding company in  question to own stock in the bank service corporation subsidiary of the  holding company, as the exemption in section 6(b)(1) would not apply  because of the servicing by the bank service corporation of  nonsubsidiary banks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of the Act.  That section exempts from section 4(a) ``shares which are of the kinds  and amounts eligible for investment by National banking associations  under the provisions of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes''. Section  5136 provides, in part, that: ``Except as hereinafter provided or  otherwise permitted by law, nothing herein contained shall authorize the  purchase by the association for its own account of any shares of stock  of any corporation.'' As the provisions of section 2(a) of the Bank  Service Corporation Act and its legislative history make it clear that  shares of a bank service corporation are of a kind eligible for  investment by national banks under section 5136, it follows that the  direct or indirect ownership on control of such shares by a bank holding  company are permissible within the amount limitation discussed in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limit on investment by bank holding company system in stock of  bank service corporation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the situation presented by paragraph  (c) the bank holding company clearly owns or controls, directly or  indirectly, all of the stock of the bank service corporation. The  remaining question, therefore, is whether the total direct and indirect  investment of the bank holding company in the bank service corporation  exceeds the amount permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effect of sections 4(a)(1) and 4(c)(4) of the Bank Holding  Company Act is to limit the amount of shares of a bank service  corporation that a bank holding company may own or control, directly or  indirectly, to the amount eligible for investment by a national bank, as  previously indicated. Under section 2(a) of the Bank Service Corporation  Act, the amount of shares of a bank service corporation eligible for  investment by a national bank may not exceed ``10 per centum [of the  bank's] * * * paid-in and unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board's view is that this aspect of the matter should be  determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Sec. 225.111,  as revised (27 FR 12671), involving the application of sections 4(a)(1)  and 4(c)(4) of the Bank Holding Company Act in the light of section  302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act limiting the amount eligible  for investment by a national bank in the shares of a small business  investment company to two percent of the bank's ``capital and surplus''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except for the differences in the percentage figures, the  investment limitation in section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment  Act is essentially the same as the investment limitation in section 2(a)  of the Bank Service Corporation Act since, as an accounting matter and  for the purposes under consideration, ``capital and surplus'' may be  regarded as equivalent in meaning to ``paid-in and unimpaired capital  and   unimpaired surplus.'' Accordingly, the maximum permissible investment by  a bank holding company system in the stock of a bank service corporation  should be determined in accordance with the formula prescribed in  Sec. 222.111.  [27 FR 12918, Dec. 29, 1962. Redesignated at 36 FR 21666, Nov. 12, 1971]</p>
