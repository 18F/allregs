                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to be eligible as a borrower under this subpart the  applicant shall be a profit or non-profit entity, which owns a nursing  home or intermediate care facility for which the Secretary of Health and  Human Services has determined that the installation of fire safety  equipment in such facility is necessary to meet the applicable  requirements of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for providers  of services under Title XVIII and Title XIX of the Social Security Act  and that upon completion of the installation of such equipment the  nursing home or intermediate care facility will meet not only the  applicable fire safety requirements of HHS but will meet other pertinent  health and safety requirements of HHS for providers of such services. At  the time of application, a nursing home or intermediate care facility  need not be providing such services if upon completion of installation  such home or facility will meet other pertinent health and safety  requirements of HHS for providers of such services. In lieu of a  facility being able to meet HHS's requirements for other pertinent  health and safety requirements at the time of application, HHS may  accept a list of deficiencies from the State Agency responsible for  determining compliance with HHS's requirements for other pertinent  health and safety requirements for providers of such services along with  a plan prepared by the applicant for correcting those deficiencies. In  such event, HHS will inform HUD that, if the facility complies with such  plan, the facility will meet the applicable health and safety  requirements of HHS for providers of services under Titles XVIII and XIX  of the Social Security Act upon the installation of the fire safety  equipment. Until the termination of all obligations of the Commissioner  under an insurance contract under this subpart and during such further  period of time as the Commissioner shall be the owner, holder, or  reinsurer of the loan, the borrower shall be regulated or restricted by  the Commissioner as to methods of operation including requirements for  maintenance of fire safety equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Also eligible as a borrower shall be a profit or nonprofit  entity which owns an assisted living facility or board and care home for  which HUD has determined that the installation of fire safety equipment  is approvable   under the definition contained in Sec. 232.500(c).
