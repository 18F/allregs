                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses and other approvals with respect to defense articles and defense services originating in certain countries or areas.

This policy applies to countries or areas with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and UNITA (Angola)).
