The destruction, absence of, or  respondent's failure to provide research records adequately documenting  the questioned research is evidence of research misconduct where ORI  establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly had research records and  destroyed them, had the opportunity to maintain the records but did not  do so, or maintained the records and failed to produce them in a timely  manner and the respondent's conduct constitutes a significant departure  from accepted practices of the relevant research community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The respondent has the burden of going forward with and the  burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any and all  affirmative defenses raised. In determining whether ORI has carried the  burden of proof imposed by   this part, the ALJ shall give due consideration to admissible, credible  evidence of honest error or difference of opinion presented by the  respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ORI bears the burden of proving that the proposed HHS  administrative actions are reasonable under the circumstances of the  case. The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving by  a preponderance of the evidence any mitigating factors that are relevant  to a decision to impose HHS administrative actions following a research  misconduct proceeding.</p>
