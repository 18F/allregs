(1) For all by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents, if applicable, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable mercury emission limit by reducing the mercury emissions data to 52-week averages using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.8243 and maintaining the 52-week average mercury emissions no higher than the applicable mercury emissions limit in Sec. 63.8190(a)(2). To obtain the data to calculate these 52-week averages, you must monitor in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Continuous monitoring option. You must collect mercury emissions data according to Sec. 63.8244(a), representing at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods in each operating day of the 52-week compliance period (with data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities not counting toward the 75 percent requirement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Periodic monitoring option.

(1) For each mercury thermal recovery unit vent, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit specified

in Sec. 63.8190(a)(3) by maintaining the outlet mercury hourly-average concentration no higher than the applicable limit. To determine the outlet mercury concentration, you must monitor according to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Continuous monitoring option.
