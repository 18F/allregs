                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance reviews.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD will review the performance of each recipient in carrying  out its responsibilities under this part whenever determined necessary  by HUD, but at least annually. In conducting performance reviews, HUD  will rely primarily on information obtained from the records and reports  from the recipient and, when appropriate, its subrecipients, as well as  information from onsite monitoring, audit reports, and information from  IDIS and HMIS. Where applicable, HUD may also consider relevant  information pertaining to the recipient's performance gained from other  sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and  litigation. Reviews to determine compliance with specific requirements  of this part will be conducted as necessary, with or without prior  notice to the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If HUD determines preliminarily that the recipient or one of its  subrecipients has not complied with an ESG program requirement, HUD will  give the recipient notice of this determination and an opportunity to  demonstrate, within the time prescribed by HUD and on the basis of  substantial facts and data, that the recipient has complied with  Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) requirements. HUD may   change the method of payment to require the recipient to obtain HUD's  prior approval each time the recipient draws down Emergency Solutions  Grant (ESG) funds. To obtain prior approval, the recipient may be  required to manually submit its payment requests and supporting  documentation to HUD in order to show that the funds to be drawn down  will be expended on eligible activities in accordance with all ESG  program requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the recipient fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that  the activities were carried out in compliance with ESG program  requirements, HUD will take one or more of the remedial actions or  sanctions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Remedial actions and sanctions. Remedial actions and sanctions  for a failure to meet an ESG program requirement will be designed to  prevent a continuation of the deficiency; mitigate, to the extent  possible, its adverse effects or consequences; and prevent its  recurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD may instruct the recipient to submit and comply with  proposals for action to correct, mitigate, and prevent noncompliance  with ESG requirements, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Preparing and following a schedule of actions for carrying out  activities affected by the noncompliance, including schedules,  timetables, and milestones necessary to implement the affected  activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing and following a management plan that assigns  responsibilities for carrying out the remedial actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Canceling or revising activities likely to be affected by the  noncompliance, before expending ESG funds for the activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reprogramming ESG funds that have not yet been expended from  affected activities to other eligible activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Suspending disbursement of ESG funds for some or all activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reducing or terminating the remaining grant of a subrecipient  and reallocating those funds to other subrecipients; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Making matching contributions before or as draws are made from  the recipient's ESG grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD may change the method of payment to a reimbursement basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD may suspend payments to the extent HUD deems it necessary to  preclude the further expenditure of funds for affected activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HUD may remove the recipient from participation in reallocations  of funds under subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> HUD may deny matching credit for all or part of the cost of the  affected activities and require the recipient to make further matching  contributions to make up for the contribution determined to be  ineligible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> HUD may require the recipient to reimburse its line of credit in  an amount equal to the funds used for the affected activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> HUD may reduce or terminate the remaining grant of a recipient  and reallocate those funds to other recipients in accordance with  subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> HUD may condition a future grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> HUD may take other remedies that are legally available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recipient sanctions. If the recipient determines that a  subrecipient is not complying with an ESG program requirement or its  subgrant agreement, the recipient must take appropriate actions, as  prescribed for HUD in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If the  recipient is a State and funds become available as a result of an action  under this section, the recipient must reallocate those funds to other  subrecipients as soon as practicable. If the recipient is a unit of  general purpose local government of territory, it must either reallocate  those funds to other subrecipients or reprogram the funds for other  activities to be carried out by the recipient as soon as practicable.  The recipient must amend its Consolidated Plan in accordance with its  citizenship participation plan if funds become available and are  reallocated or reprogrammed under this section. The reallocated or  reprogrammed funds must be used by the expenditure deadline in Sec.   576.203.</p>
