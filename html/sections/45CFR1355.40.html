                                Sec. 1355.40  Foster care and adoption data collection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of the data collection system. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each title IV-E agency  which administers or supervises the administration of titles IV-B and  IV-E must implement a system to collect data. The data reporting system  must meet the requirements of Sec. 1355.40(b) and electronically report  certain data regarding children in foster care and adoption. The foster  care data elements are listed and defined in Appendix A to this part and  the adoption data elements are listed and defined in Appendix B to this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of foster care reporting, each data  transmission must include all children in foster care for whom the title  IV-E agency has responsibility for placement, care, or supervision. This  includes American Indian children covered under the assurances in  section 422(b)(8) of the Act on the same basis as any other child. For  children in care less than 30 days, only a core set of information will  be required, as noted in Appendix A to this part. For children who enter  foster care prior to October 1, 1995 and who are still in the system,  core data elements will be required; in addition, the title IV-E agency  also will be required to report on the most recent case plan goal  affecting those children. For children in out-of-State placement, the  State placing the child and making the foster care payment submits and  continually updates the data. For children in the Tribal title IV-E  agency's placement and care responsibility who are placed outside of the  Tribal service area, the Indian Tribe placing the child and making  foster care payments submits and continually updates the data for each  such child.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of adoption reporting, data are required to be  transmitted by the title IV-E agency on all adopted children who were  placed by   the title IV-E agency, and on all adopted children for whom the agency  is providing adoption assistance (either ongoing or for nonrecurring  expenses), care or services directly or by contract or agreement with  other private or public agencies. Full adoption data as specified in  appendix B to this part are required only for children adopted after the  implementation date of October 1, 1994. For children adopted prior to  October 1, 1994, who are continuing to receive title IV-E subsidies,  aggregate data are to be reported. For a child adopted out-of-State, the  title IV-E agency which placed the child submits the data. Similarly,  the Tribal title IV-E agency which placed the child outside of the  Tribal service area for adoption submits the data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foster care and adoption reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The title  IV-E agency shall transmit semi-annually, within 45 days of the end of  the reporting period (i.e., by May 15 and November 14), information on  each child in foster care and each child adopted during the reporting  period. The information to be reported consists of the data elements  found in appendices A and B to this part. The data must be extracted  from the data system as of the last day of the reporting period and must  be submitted in electronic form as described in appendix C to this part  and in record layouts as delineated in appendix D to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For foster care information, the child-specific data to be  transmitted must reflect the data in the information system when the  data are extracted. Dates of removal from the home and discharge from  foster care must be entered in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this  section. The date of the most recent periodic review (either  administrative or court) must be entered for children who have been in  foster care for more than nine months. Entry of this date constitutes  title IV-E agency certification that the data on the child have been  reviewed and are current.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adoption data are to be reported during the reporting period in  which the adoption is legalized or, at the title IV-E agency's option,  in the following reporting period if the adoption is legalized within  the last 60 days of the reporting period. For a semi-annual period in  which no adoptions have been legalized, the title IV-E agency must  report such an occurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary file of the semi-annual data transmission must be  submitted and will be used to verify the completeness of the title IV-E  agency's detailed submission for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A variety of internal data consistency checks will be used to  judge the internal consistency of the semi-annual detailed data  submission. These are specified in Appendix E to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Missing data standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``missing data'' refers to  instances where no data have been entered, if applicable, for a  particular data element. In addition, all data elements which fail a  consistency check for a particular case will be converted to missing  data. All data which are ``out of range'' (i.e., the response is beyond  the parameters allowed for that particular data element) will also be  converted to missing data. Details of the circumstances under which data  will be converted to missing data are specified in appendix E to this  part. Data elements with responses of ``cannot be determined'' or ``not  yet determined'' are not considered as having missing data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantial noncompliance occurs when missing data exceed 10  percent for any one data element.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timeliness of foster care data reports. Ninety percent of the  subject transactions must have been entered into the system within 60  days of the event (removal from home or discharge from foster care) or  the title IV-E agency will be found in substantial noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Substantial Noncompliance. Failure by a title IV-E agency to  meet any of the standards described in paragraphs   (a) through (d) of this section is considered a substantial failure to  meet the requirements of the title IV-E plan.  (This requirement has been approved by the Office of Management and  Budget under OMB Control Number 0980-0267. In accordance with the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor,  and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information  unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.)
