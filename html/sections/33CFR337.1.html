                            <p class="depth0">Presently, public notification of proposed discharges of dredged or  fill material is required by the provisions of section 103 of the ODA  and sections 401 and 404 of the CWA. District engineers are encouraged  to develop procedures to avoid unnecessary duplication of state agency  procedures. Joint public notification procedures should be a primary  factor in the development of Memoranda of Agreement with the states as  described in Sec. 337.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With the possible exception of emergency actions as discussed in  Sec. 337.7, the district engineer should issue a public notice for  projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters  of the U.S. or ocean waters unless the project is authorized by a  general permit. Public notices for Corps operation and maintenance  activities are normally issued for an indefinite period of time and are  not reissued unless changes in the disposal plan warrant re-evaluation  under section 404 of the CWA or section 103 of the ODA. The public  notice is the primary method of advising all interested parties of  Federal projects and of soliciting comments and information necessary to  evaluate the probable impact of the discharge of dredged or fill  material into waters of the U.S. or ocean waters. The notice should,  therefore, include sufficient information to provide a clear  understanding of the nature of the activity and related activities of  local interests in order to generate meaningful comments. A single  public notice may be used for more than one project in appropriate  cases. The notice normally should include the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and location of the project and proposed disposal site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A general description of the project and a description of the  estimated type, composition, and quantity of materials to be discharged,  the proposed time schedule for the dredging   activity, and the types of equipment and methods of dredging and  conveyance proposed to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A sketch showing the location of the project, including depth of  water in the area and all proposed discharge sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The nature, estimated amount, and frequency of known and  anticipated related dredging and discharge to be conducted by others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A list of Federal, state, and local environmental agencies with  whom the activity is being coordinated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement concerning a preliminary determination of the need  for and/or availability of an environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other available information which may assist interested  parties in evaluating the likely impact of the proposed activity, if  any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A reasonable period of time, normally thirty days but not less  than fifteen days from date of mailing except in emergency situations  where the procedures of Sec. 337.7 will be followed, within which  interested parties may express their views concerning the proposed  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If the proposed Federal project would occur in the territorial  seas or ocean waters, a description of the project's relationship to the  baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A statement on the status of state water quality certification  under section 401 of the CWA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> For activities requiring a determination of consistency with an  approved state coastal zone management plan, the following information  will be included in the notice:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement on whether or not the proposed activity will be  undertaken in a manner consistent to the maximum extent practicable with  the state management program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sufficient information to support the consistency determination  to include associated facilities and their coastal zone effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Data and supporting information commensurate with the expected  effects of the activity on the coastal zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A statement on historic resources, state of present knowledge,  likelihood of damage or other adverse effect on such resources, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A statement on endangered species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> A statement on evaluation factors to be considered, adapted  from that presented at 33 CFR 325.3(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the Corps employee  from whom additional information concerning the project may be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The signature of the district engineer or his designee on all  maintenance dredged material disposal public notices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> For activities regulated under section 103 of the ODA, the  following additional information should be integrated into the public  notice:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement on the designation status of the disposal site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the proposed disposal site is not a designated site, a  description of the characteristics of the proposed disposal site and an  explanation as to why no previously designated disposal site is  feasible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A brief description of known dredged material discharges at  the proposed disposal site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Existence and documented effects of other authorized disposals  that have been made at the disposal area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An estimated length of time during which disposal would continue  at the proposed site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information on the characteristics and composition of the  dredged material, and the following paragraph:</p><p class="depth4">The proposed transportation of this dredged material for disposing  of it in ocean waters is being evaluated to determine that the proposed  disposal will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health,  welfare, or amenities or the marine environment, ecological systems, or  economic potentialities. In making this determination, the criteria  established by the Administrator, EPA pursuant to section 102(a) of the  ODA, will be applied. In addition, based upon an evaluation of the  potential effect which the failure to utilize this ocean disposal site  will have on navigation, economic and industrial development, and  foreign and domestic commerce of the United States, an independent  determination will be made of the need to dispose of the dredged  material in ocean waters, other possible methods of disposal, and other  appropriate locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following statement should be included in the public  notices:</p><p class="depth2">Any person who has an interest which may be affected by the disposal  of this dredged material may request a public hearing. The request must  be submitted in writing to the district engineer within the comment  period of this notice and must clearly set forth the interest which may  be affected and the manner in which the interest may be affected by this  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. In addition, public notices should be sent to CECW-D, Office  of the Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314, if the project involves  the discharge of dredged material in waters of the U.S. or ocean waters.  District engineers should also develop, as appropriate, regional mailing  lists for Corps maintenance dredging and disposal activities to the  extent that property owners adjacent to the navigation channel and  disposal area are notified of the proposed activity. In order to effect  compliance with Executive Order 12372, district engineers should provide  copies of public notices to concerned state and local elected officials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The district engineer should consider all comments received in  response to the public notice in his subsequent actions. All comments  expressing objections to or raising questions about the project should  be acknowledged. Comments received as form letters or petitions,  however, may be acknowledged as a group to the person or organization  responsible for the form letter or petition. If comments are received  which relate to matters within the special expertise of another agency,  the district engineer may seek the advice of that agency. The receipt of  comments as a result of the public notice normally should not extend  beyond the stated comment period; however, at his discretion, the  district engineer may provide an extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notices sent to several agencies within the same state may  result in conflicting comments from those agencies. Many states have  designated a state agency or individual to provide a single and  coordinated state position regarding Federal activities. Where a state  has not so designated a single source, the district engineer, as  appropriate, may seek from the Governor an expression of his views and  desires concerning the proposed and subsequent similar projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All comments received from the public notice coordination should  be considered in the public interest review process. Comments received  from Federal or state agencies which are within the area of expertise of  another agency will be communicated with that other agency if the  district engineer needs the information to make a final determination on  the proposed project.</p>
