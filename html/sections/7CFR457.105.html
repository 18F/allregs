In addition to the definition contained in the  Basic Provisions, cotton must be planted in rows, unless otherwise  provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written  agreement. The yield conversion factor normally applied to non-irrigated  skip-row cotton acreage will not be used if the land between the rows of  cotton is planted to any other spring planted crop.</p><p class="depth0">Production guarantee. The number of pounds determined by multiplying  the approved yield per acre by any applicable yield conversion factor  for non-irrigated skip-row planting patterns, and multiplying the result  by the coverage level percentage you elect.</p><p class="depth0">Replanting. Performing the cultural practices necessary to replace  the ELS cotton seed, and replacing the seed with either ELS or AUP  cotton seed in the insured acreage with the expectation of growing a  successful crop.</p><p class="depth0">Skip-row. A planting pattern that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consists of alternating rows of cotton and fallow land or land  planted to another crop the previous fall; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualifies as a skip-row planting pattern as defined by the Farm  Service Agency (FSA) or a successor agency.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions  (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The acreage insured will be only the land occupied by the rows  of cotton when a skip row planting pattern is utilized; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final  planting date, to the extent that a majority of producers in the area  would not be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to  replant.</p><p class="depth0">7.

Upon such agreement the  insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to  another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of  production is not reached:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may  give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave  intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the  crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count  for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals  from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not  leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provided sufficient  care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to  put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of  production to count.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of  production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or  our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not  harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including  any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mature ELS cotton production may be adjusted for quality when  production has been damaged by insured causes.
