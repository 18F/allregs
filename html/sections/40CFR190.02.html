                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nuclear fuel cycle means the operations defined to be associated  with the production of electrical power for public use by any fuel cycle  through utilization of nuclear energy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Uranium fuel cycle means the operations of milling of uranium  ore, chemical conversion of uranium, isotopic enrichment of uranium,  fabrication of uranium fuel, generation of electricity by a light-water- cooled nuclear power plant using uranium fuel, and reprocessing of spent  uranium fuel, to the extent that these directly support the production  of electrical power for public use utilizing nuclear energy, but  excludes mining operations, operations at waste disposal sites,  transporta tion of any radioactive material in sup port of these  operations, and the reuse of recovered non-uranium special nu clear and  by-product materials from the cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General environment means the total terrestrial, atmospheric and  aquatic environments outside sites upon which any operation which is  part of a nuclear fuel cycle is conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Site means the area contained within the boundary of a location  under the control of persons possessing or using radioactive material on  which is conducted one or more operations covered by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Radiation means any or all of the following: Alpha, beta, gamma,  or X-rays; neutrons; and high-energy electrons, protons, or other atomic  particles; but not sound or radio waves, nor visible, infrared, or ultra  violet light.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Radioactive material means any material which spontaneously  emits radiation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Curie (Ci) means that quantity of radioactive material producing  37 billion nuclear transformations per second. (One millicurie  (mCi)=0.001 Ci.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dose equivalent means the product of absorbed dose and  appropriate factors to account for differences in biological  effectiveness due to the quality of radiation and its spatial  distribution in the body. The unit of dose equivalent is the ``rem.''  (One millirem (mrem)= 0.001 rem.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Organ means any human organ exclusive of the dermis, the  epidermis, or the cornea.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Gigawatt-year refers to the quantity of electrical energy  produced at the busbar of a generating station. A gigawatt is equal to  one billion watts. A gigawatt-year is equivalent to the amount of energy  output represented by an average electric power level of one gigawatt  sustained for one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Member of the public means any individual that can receive a  radiation dose in the general environment, whether he may or may not  also be exposed to radiation in an occupation associated with a nuclear  fuel cycle. However, an individual is not considered a member of the  public during any   period in which he is engaged in carrying out any operation which is  part of a nuclear fuel cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Regulatory agency means the government agency responsible for  issuing regulations governing the use of sources of radiation or  radioactive materials or emissions therefrom and carrying out inspection  and enforcement activities to assure compliance with such regulations.</p>
