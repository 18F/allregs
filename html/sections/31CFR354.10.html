In any case or any class of cases  arising under   these regulations, Sallie Mae may require such additional evidence and a  bond of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of  Sallie Mae be necessary for the protection of the interests of Sallie  Mae.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of attachment for Sallie Mae Securities in Book-entry  System. The interest of a debtor in a Security Entitlement may be  reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the Securities  Intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained,  except where a Security Entitlement is maintained in the name of a  secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by  legal process upon the secured party. The regulations in this part do  not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to  honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or  class of cases.</p>
