                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formula. An issuer's credibility adjustment, if any, is the product of the base credibility factor, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the deductible factor, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Base credibility factor. (1) The base credibility factor for fully credible experience or for non-credible experience is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The base credibility factor for fully credible experience or for non-credible experience is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The base credibility factor for partially credible experience is determined based on the number of life-years included in the aggregation, as determined under Sec. 158.231 of this subpart, and the factors shown in Table 1. When the number of life-years used to determine credibility exactly matches a life-year category listed in Table 1, the value associated with that number of life-years is the base credibility factor. The base credibility factor for a number of life-years between the values shown in Table 1 is determined by linear interpolation.</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Sec. 158.232: Base Credibility Factors------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Life-years                     Base credibility factor------------------------------------------------------------------------<1,000................................
