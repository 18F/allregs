                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part establishes the criteria and procedures under which  substances   will be regulated by OSHA as potential occupational carcinogens.  Although the conclusive identification of ``carcinogens'' is a complex  matter ``on the frontiers of science,'' (IUD v. Hodgson 499 F. 2d 467,  474 (D.C. Cir. 1974)), responsible health regulatory policy requires  that criteria should be specified for the identification of substances  which should be regulated as posing potential cancer risks to workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The criteria established by this part are based on an extensive  review of scientific data and opinions. The part provides for amending  these criteria in light of new scientific developments. Decisions as to  whether any particular substance meets the criteria or not will be  consistent with the policies and procedures established by this part and  will be based upon scientific evaluation of the evidence on that  substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part applies to individual substances, groups of  substances, or combinations or mixtures of substances which may be found  in workplaces in the United States. In individual rulemaking proceedings  under this part, the identity and range of substances and mixtures to be  covered by the standard will be specified and the appropriateness of  applying the available evidence to the range of substances and mixtures  proposed for regulation will be subject to scientific and policy review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Potential occupational carcinogens will be identified and  classified on the basis of human epidemiological studies and/or  experimental carcinogenesis bioassays in mammals. Positive results in  short term tests will also be used as concordant evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Potential occupational carcinogens will be classified and  regulated in accordance with the policy. The scientific evidence as to  whether individual substances meet these criteria will be considered in  individual rulemakings. The issues which may be considered in these  rulemakings will be limited as specified herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This policy provides for the classification of potential  occupational carcinogens into two categories depending on the nature and  extent of the available scientific evidence. The two categories of  potential occupational carcinogens may be regulated differently.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The policy establishes a procedure for setting priorities and  making them public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Worker exposure to Category I Potential Carcinogens will be  reduced primarily through the use of engineering and work practice  controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Worker exposure to Category II Potential Carcinogens will be  reduced as appropriate and consistent with the statutory requirements on  a case-by-case basis in the rulemaking proceedings on individual  substances. Any permissible exposure level so established shall be met  primarily through engineering and work practice controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The assessment of cancer risk to workers resulting from exposure  to a potential occupational carcinogen will be made on the basis of  available data. Because of the uncertainties and serious consequences to  workers if the estimated risk is understated, cautious and prudent  assumptions will be utilized to perform risk assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Where the Secretary determines that one or more suitable  substitutes exist for certain uses of Category I Potential Carcinogens  that are less hazardous to humans, a no occupational exposure level  shall be set for those uses, to be achieved solely through the use of  engineering and work practice controls to encourage substitution. In  determining whether a substitute is suitable, the Secretary will  consider the technological and economic feasibility of the introduction  of the substitute, including its relative effectiveness and other  relevant factors, such as regulatory requirements and the time needed  for an orderly transition to the substitute.
