                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certified applicators whose activities indicate a supervisory role must demonstrate a practical knowledge of Federal and State supervisory requirements, including labeling, regarding the application of restricted use pesticides by noncertified applicators.
The availability of the certified applicator must be directly related to the hazard of the situation. In many situations, where the certified applicator is not required to be physically present, ``direct supervision'' shall include verifiable instruction to the competent person, as follows: (1) Detailed guidance for applying the pesticide properly, and (2) provisions for contacting the certified applicator in the event he is needed. In other situations, and as required by the label, the actual physical presence of a certified applicator may be required when application is made by a noncertified applicator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
