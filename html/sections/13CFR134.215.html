                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A motion for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from  a Judge's ruling will not be entertained in those proceedings in which  OHA issues final decisions. In all other cases, an interlocutory appeal  will be permitted only if, upon motion by a party, or upon the Judge's  own initiative, the Judge certifies that his or her ruling raises a  question which is immediately appealable. Interlocutory appeals will be  decided by the AA/OHA or a designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion for certification. A party must file and serve a motion  for certification no later than 20 days after   issuance of the ruling to which the motion applies. A denial of the  motion does not preclude objections to the ruling in any subsequent  request for review of an initial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis for certification. The Judge will certify a ruling for  interlocutory appeal only if he or she determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about  which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An interlocutory appeal will materially expedite resolution of  the case, or denial of an interlocutory appeal would cause undue  hardship to a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stay of proceedings. A stay while an interlocutory appeal is  pending will be at the discretion of the Judge.  [61 FR 2683, Jan. 29, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 47249, July 18, 2002]</p>
