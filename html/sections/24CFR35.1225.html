                                Sec. 35.1225  Child with an environmental intervention blood lead level.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 15 days after being notified by a public health department or other medical health care provider that a child of less than 6 years of age living in an assisted dwelling unit has been identified as having an environmental intervention blood lead level, the designated party shall complete a risk assessment of the dwelling unit in which the child lived at the time the blood was last sampled and of the common areas servicing the dwelling unit. The risk assessment shall be conducted in accordance with Sec. 35.1320(b). When the risk assessment is complete, the designated party shall immediately provide the report of the risk assessment to the owner of the dwelling unit. If the child identified as having an environmental intervention blood lead level is no longer living in the unit when the designated party receives notification from the public health department or other medical health care provider, but another household receiving tenant-based rental assistance is living in the unit or is planning to live there, the requirements of this section apply just as they do if the child still lives in the unit. If a public health department has already conducted an evaluation of the dwelling unit, or the designated party conducted a risk assessment of the unit and common areas servicing the unit between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date when the designated party received the notification of the environmental intervention blood lead level, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Verification. After receiving information from a source other than a public health department or other medical health care provider that a child of less than 6 years of age living in an assisted dwelling unit may have an environmental intervention blood lead level, the designated party shall immediately

verify the information with a public health department or other medical health care provider. If that department or provider verifies that the child has an environmental intervention blood lead level, such verification shall constitute notification to the designated party as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and the designated party shall take the action required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hazard reduction. Within 30 days after receiving the risk assessment report from the designated party or the evaluation from the public health department, the owner shall complete the reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards in accordance with Sec. 35.1325 or Sec. 35.1330. Hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with Sec. 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the risk assessment have been treated with interim controls or abatement or when the public health department certifies that the lead-based paint hazard reduction is complete. If the owner does not complete the hazard reduction required by this section, the dwelling unit is in violation of Housing Quality Standards (HQS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of evaluation and hazard reduction. The owner shall notify building residents of any evaluation or hazard reduction activities in accordance with Sec. 35.125.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting requirement. The designated party shall report the name and address of a child identified as having an environmental intervention blood lead level to the public health department within 5 working days of being so notified by any other medical health care professional.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data collection and record keeping responsibilities. At least quarterly, the designated party shall attempt to obtain from the public health department(s) with area(s) of jurisdiction similar to that of the designated party the names and/or addresses of children of less than 6 years of age with an identified environmental intervention blood lead level. At least quarterly, the designated party shall also report an updated list of the addresses of units receiving assistance under a tenant-based rental assistance program to the same public health department(s), except that the report(s) to the public health department(s) is not required if the health department states that it does not wish to receive such report. If it obtains names and addresses of environmental intervention blood lead level children from the public health department(s), the designated party shall match information on cases of environmental intervention blood lead levels with the names and addresses of families receiving tenant-based rental assistance, unless the public health department performs such a matching procedure. If a match occurs, the designated party shall carry out the requirements of this section.
