                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption. Each returning resident (including American citizens  who are residents of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States) is  entitled to bring in free of duty and internal revenue tax under  subheading 9804.00.45, and Chapter 98, U.S Note 3, Harmonized Tariff  Schedule of the United States, (19 U.S.C. 1202), all personal and  household effects taken abroad. To ensure allowance of the exemption,  articles of foreign origin should be registered in accordance with Sec.  148.1. Automobiles and other vehicles, aircraft, boats, teams and saddle  horses, together with their accessories, may be brought in free of duty  if taken abroad for noncommercial use (see Sec. 148.32).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repair or alteration while abroad. If any such personal or  household effect taken abroad has been advanced in value or improved in  condition while abroad by repairs (including cleaning) not merely  incidental to wear or use while abroad, or by alterations (including  additions) which did not change the identity of the article, the cost or  value of such repairs or alterations is subject to duty unless all or  part of such cost or value is covered by an allowance of the $800 or  $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad (see Sec. 148.33). An  effect taken abroad and there changed into a different article is  dutiable at its full value when returned to the United States, unless  covered in whole or in part by some provision for free entry.
