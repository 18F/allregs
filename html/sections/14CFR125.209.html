                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person may operate an airplane in extended overwater operations unless it carries, installed in conspicuously marked locations easily accessible to the occupants if a ditching occurs, the following equipment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An approved life preserver equipped with an approved survivor locator light, or an approved flotation means, for each occupant of the aircraft. The life preserver or other flotation means must be easily accessible to each seated occupant. If a flotation means other than a life preserver is used, it must be readily removable from the airplane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enough approved life rafts (with proper buoyancy) to carry all occupants of the airplane, and at least the following equipment for each raft clearly marked for easy identification--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One canopy (for sail, sunshade, or rain catcher);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One radar reflector (or similar device);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> One life raft repair kit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> One bailing bucket;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> One signaling mirror;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> One police whistle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> One raft knife;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> One CO2 bottle for emergency inflation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> One inflation pump;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Two oars;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> One 75-foot retaining line;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> One magnetic compass;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> One dye marker;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> One flashlight having at least two size ``D'' cells or equivalent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> At least one approved pyrotechnic signaling device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> A 2-day supply of emergency food rations supplying at least 1,000 calories a day for each person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvii)</em> One sea water desalting kit for each two persons that raft is rated to carry, or two pints of water for each person the raft is rated to carry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xviii)</em> One fishing kit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xix)</em> One book on survival appropriate for the area in which the airplane is operated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No person may operate an airplane in extended overwater operations unless there is attached to one of the life rafts required by paragraph (a) of this section, an approved survival type emergency locator transmitter. Batteries used in this transmitter must be replaced (or recharged, if the batteries are rechargeable) when the transmitter has been in use for more than one cumulative hour, or, when 50 percent of their useful life (or for rechargeable batteries, 50 percent of their useful life of charge) has expired, as established by the transmitter manufacturer under its approval. The new expiration date for replacing (or recharging) the battery must be legibly marked on the outside of the transmitter. The battery useful life (or useful life of charge) requirements of this paragraph do not apply to batteries (such as water-activated batteries) that are essentially unaffected during probable storage intervals.
