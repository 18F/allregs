For each award year and for  each eligible GE program offered by an institution, the Secretary  calculates two D/E rates, the discretionary income rate and the annual  earnings rate, using the procedures in Sec. Sec.  668.404 through  668.406.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Outcomes of the D/E rates measure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A GE program is  ``passing'' the D/E rates measure if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its discretionary income rate is less than or equal to 20  percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its annual earnings rate is less than or equal to eight  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A GE program is ``failing'' the D/E rates measure if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its discretionary income rate is greater than 30 percent or the  income for the denominator of the rate (discretionary earnings) is  negative or zero; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its annual earnings rate is greater than 12 percent or the  denominator of the rate (annual earnings) is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A GE program is ``in the zone'' for the purpose of the D/E rates  measure if it is not a passing GE program and its--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Discretionary income rate is greater than 20 percent but less  than or equal to 30 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Annual earnings rate is greater than eight percent but less  than or equal to 12 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the purpose of the D/E rates measure, subject to paragraph  (c)(5) of this section, a GE program becomes ineligible if the program  either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is failing the D/E rates measure in two out of any three  consecutive award years for which the program's D/E rates are  calculated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has a combination of zone and failing D/E rates for four  consecutive award years for which the program's D/E rates are  calculated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the Secretary does not calculate or issue D/E rates for a  program for an award year, the program receives no result under the D/E  rates measure for that award year and remains in the same status under  the D/E rates measure as the previous award year; provided that if the  Secretary does not calculate D/E rates for the program for four or more  consecutive award years, the Secretary disregards the program's D/E  rates for any award year prior to the four-year period in determining  the program's eligibility.
