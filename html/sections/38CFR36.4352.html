                                Sec. 36.4352  Authority to close loans on the automatic basis.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Supervised lender authority. Supervised lenders of the classes  described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1) and (2) are authorized by statute to  process VA guaranteed home loans on the automatic basis. This category  of lenders includes any Federal land bank, national bank, State bank,  private bank, building and loan association, insurance company, credit  union or mortgage and loan company that is subject to examination and  supervision by an agency of the United States or of any State or by any  State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-supervised lender authority. Non-supervised lenders of the  class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must apply to the Secretary for  authority to process loans on the automatic basis. Each of the minimum  requirements   listed below must be met by applicant lenders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Experience. The applicant lender must meet one of the following  experience requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant lender must have been actively engaged in  originating VA loans for at least two years, have a VA Lender ID number  and have originated and closed a minimum of ten VA loans within the past  two years, excluding interest rate reduction refinance loans (IRRRLs),  that have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA  requirements and procedures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant lender must have a VA ID number and, if active  for less than two years, have originated and closed at least 25 VA  loans, excluding IRRRLs, that have been properly documented and  submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each principal officer of the applicant lender, who is  actively involved in managing origination functions, must have a minimum  of two recent years' management experience in the origination of VA  loans. This experience may be with the current or prior employer. For  the purposes of this requirement, principal officer is defined as  president or vice president; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the applicant lender has been operating as an agent for a  non-supervised automatic lender (sponsoring lender), the firm must  submit documentation confirming that it has a VA Lender ID number and  has originated a minimum of ten VA loans, excluding IRRRLs, over the  past two years. If active for less than two years, the agent must have  originated at least 25 VA loans. The required documentation is a copy of  the VA letter approving the applicant lender as an agent for the  sponsoring lender; a copy of the corporate resolution, describing the  functions the agent was to perform, submitted to VA by the sponsoring  lender; and a letter from a senior officer of the sponsoring lender  indicating the number of VA loans submitted by the agent each year and  that the loans have been properly documented and submitted in compliance  with VA requirements and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Underwriter. A senior officer of the applicant lender must  nominate a full-time qualified employee(s) to act in the applicant  lender's behalf as underwriter(s) to personally review and make  underwriting decisions on VA loans to be closed on the automatic basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nominees for underwriter must have a minimum of three years  experience in processing, pre-underwriting or underwriting mortgage  loans. At least one recent year of this experience must have included  making underwriting decisions on VA loans. (Recent is defined as within  the past three years.) A VA nomination and current resume, outlining the  underwriter's specific experience with VA loans, must be submitted for  each underwriter nominee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternatively, if an underwriter does not have the experience  outlined above, the underwriter must submit documentation verifying that  he or she is a current Accredited Residential Underwriter (ARU) as  designated by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an underwriter is not located in the lender's corporate  office, then a senior officer must certify that the underwriter reports  to and is supervised by an individual who is not a branch manager or  other person with production responsibilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All VA-approved underwriters must attend a 1-day (eight-hour)  training course on underwriter responsibilities, VA underwriting  requirements, and VA administrative requirements, including the usage of  VA forms, within 90 days of approval (if VA is unable to make such  training available within 90 days, the underwriter must attend the first  available training). Immediately upon approval of a VA underwriter, the  office of jurisdiction will contact the underwriter to schedule this  training at a VA regional office (VARO) of the underwriter's choice.  This training is required for all newly approved VA underwriters,  including those who qualified for approval based on an ARU designation,  as well as VA-approved underwriters who have not underwritten VA- guaranteed loans in the past 24 months. Furthermore, and at the  discretion of any VARO in whose jurisdiction the lender is originating  VA loans, VA-approved underwriters   who consistently approve loans that do not meet VA credit standards may  be required to retake this training.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Underwriter certification. The lender must certify that all  underwriting decisions as to whether to accept or reject a VA loan will  be made by a VA-approved underwriter. In addition each VA-approved  underwriter will be required to certify on each VA loan that he or she  approves that the loan has been personally reviewed and approved by the  underwriter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial requirements. Each application must include the most  recent annual financial statement audited and certified by a certified  public accountant (CPA). If the date of the annual financial statement  precedes that of the application by more than six months, the lender  must also attach a copy of its latest internal financial statement.  Lenders are required to meet either the working capital or the minimum  net worth financial requirement as defined below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Working capital. A minimum of $50,000 in working capital must be  demonstrated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Working capital is a measure of an applicant lender's liquidity,  or the ability to pay its short-term debts. Working capital is defined  as the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Current assets  are defined as cash or other liquid assets convertible into cash within  a 1-year period. Current liabilities are defined as debts that must be  paid within the same 1-year time frame.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The VA determination of whether a lender has the required  minimum working capital is based on the balance sheet of the lender's  annual audited financial statement. Therefore, either the balance sheet  must be classified to distinguish between current and fixed assets and  between current and long-term liabilities or the information must be  provided in a footnote to the statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Net worth. Lenders must show evidence of a minimum of $ 250,000  in adjusted net worth. Net worth is a measure of an applicant lender's  solvency, or its ability to exist in the long run, quantified by the  payment of long-term debts. Net worth as defined by generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP) is total assets minus total liabilities.  Adjusted net worth for VA purposes is the same as the adjusted net worth  required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), net  worth less certain unacceptable assets including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of  another person or entity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender  or related entities, in which the lender's officers or stockholders have  a personal interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or  stockholder.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any investment in related entities in which the lender's  officers or stockholders have a personal interest unrelated to their  position as an officer or stockholder.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries,  affiliates and/or other related entities which is carried at a value  greater than equity, as adjusted. ``Equity as adjusted'' means the book  value of the related entity reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets  carried by the related entity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete,  franchisee fees, organization costs, etc., except unamortized servicing  costs carried at a value established by an arm's-length transaction and  presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which  appraised values are very subjective, carried at a value in excess of a  substantially discounted appraised value. Assets such as antiques, art  work and gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried  at the lower of cost or market.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of  an officer or stockholder and not for normal business purposes. Adjusted  net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and certified  balance sheet from the lender's latest financial statements. ``Personal  interest'' as used in this section indicates a relationship between the  lender and a person or entity in which that specified person (e.g.,  spouse, parent, grandparent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle or in- law)   has a financial interest in or is employed in a management position by  the lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Lines of credit. The lender applicant must have one or more  lines of credit aggregating at least $ 1 million. The identity of the  source(s) of warehouse lines of credit must be submitted to VA and the  applicant must agree that VA may contact the named source(s) for the  purpose of verifying the information. A line of credit must be  unrestricted, that is, funds are available upon demand to close loans  and are not dependent on prior investor approval. A letter from the  company(ies) verifying the unrestricted line(s) of credit must be  submitted with the application for automatic authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Permanent investors. If the lender customarily sells loans it  originates, it must have a minimum of two permanent investors. The  names, addresses and telephone numbers of the permanent investors must  be submitted with the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Liaison. The lender applicant must designate an employee and an  alternate to be the primary liaison with VA. The liaison officers should  be thoroughly familiar with the lender's entire operation and be able to  respond to any query from VA concerning a particular VA loan or the  firm's automatic authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Other considerations. All applications will also be reviewed in  light of the following considerations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There must be no factors that indicate that the firm would not  exercise the care and diligence required of a lender originating and  closing VA loans on the automatic basis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event the applicant lender, any member of the board of  directors, or any principal officer has ever been debarred or suspended  by any Federal agency or department, or any of its directors or officers  has been a director or officer of any other lender or corporation that  was so debarred or suspended, or if the lender applicant ever had a  servicing contract with an investor terminated for cause, a statement of  the facts must be submitted with the application for automatic  authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Quality control system. In order to be approved as a non- supervised lender for automatic-processing authority, the lender must  implement a written quality control system which ensures compliance with  VA requirements. The lender must agree to furnish findings under its  systems to VA on demand. The elements of the quality control system must  include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Underwriting policies. Each office of the lender shall maintain  copies of VA credit standards and all available VA underwriting  guidelines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Corrective measures. The system should ensure that effective  corrective measures are taken promptly when deficiencies in loan  originations are identified by either the lender or VA. Any cases  involving major discrepancies which are discovered under the system must  be reported to VA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> System integrity. The quality control system should be  independent of the mortgage loan production function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Scope. The review of underwriting decisions and certifications  must include compliance with VA underwriting requirements, sufficiency  of documentation and soundness of underwriting judgments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Appraisal quality. For lenders approved for the Lender Appraisal  Processing Program (LAPP), the quality control system must specifically  contain provisions concerning the adequacy and quality of real property  appraisals. While the lender's quality control personnel need not be  appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and  techniques so that they can select appropriate cases for review if  discretionary sampling is used, and prescribe appropriate corrective  action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems  are identified. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self- policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to  the VA office of jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Courtesy closing. The lender applicant must certify to VA that  it will not close loans on an automatic basis as a courtesy or  accommodation for other mortgage lenders, whether or not such lenders  are themselves approved to close on an automatic basis without the  express approval of VA. However, a lender with automatic authority may  close loans for which information and   supporting credit data have been developed on its behalf by a duly  authorized agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Probation. Lenders meeting these requirements will be approved  to close VA loans on an automatic basis for a 1-year period. At the end  of this period, the lender's quality of underwriting, the completeness  of loan submissions, compliance with VA requirements and procedures, and  the delinquency and foreclosure rates will be reviewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Extensions of automatic authority. When a lender wants its  automatic authority extended to another State, the request must be  submitted, with the fee designated in paragraph (e)(5) of this section,  to the VA regional office having jurisdiction in the State where the  lender's corporate office is located.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a lender wants its automatic authority to include loans  involving a real estate brokerage and/or a residential builder or  developer in which it has a financial interest, owns, is owned by, or  with which it is affiliated, the following documentation must be  submitted:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A corporate resolution from the lender and each affiliate  indicating that they are separate entities operating independently of  each other. The lender's corporate resolution must indicate that it will  not give more favorable underwriting consideration to its affiliate's  loans, and the affiliate's corporate resolution must indicate that it  will not seek to influence the lender to give their loans more favorable  underwriting consideration.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Letters from permanent investors indicating the percentage of  all VA loans based on the affiliate's production originated by the  lender over a 1-year period that are past due 90 days or more. This  delinquency ratio must be no higher than the national average for the  same period for all mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a lender wants its automatic authority extended to  additional States, the lender must indicate how it plans to originate VA  loans in those States. Unless a lender proposes a telemarketing plan, VA  requires that a lender have a presence in the State, that is, a branch  office, an agent relationship, or that it is a reasonable distance from  one of its offices in an adjacent State, i.e., 50 miles. If the request  is based on an agency relationship, the documentation outlined in  paragraph (b)(13) must be submitted with the request for extension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Use of agents. A lender using an agent to perform a portion of  the work involved in originating and closing a VA-guaranteed loan on an  automatic basis must take full responsibility by certification for all  acts, errors and omissions of the agent or other entity and its  employees for the work performed. Any such acts, errors or omissions  will be treated as those of the lender and appropriate sanctions may be  imposed against the lender and its agent. Lenders requesting an agent  must submit the following documentation to the VA regional office having  jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A corporate resolution certifying that the lender takes full  responsibility for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent that it  is requesting. The corporate resolution must also identify the agent's  name and address, and the geographic area in which the agent will be  originating and/or closing VA loans; whether the agent is authorized to  issue interest rate lock-in agreements on behalf of the lender; and  outline the functions the agent is to perform. Alternatively, the lender  may submit a blanket corporate resolution which sets forth the functions  of any and all agents and identifies individual agents by name, address,  and geographic area in separate letters which refer to the blanket  resolution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the VA regional office having jurisdiction for the  lender's corporate office acknowledges receipt of the lender's request  in writing, the agent is thereby authorized to originate VA loans on the  lender's behalf.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting responsibility. A lender approved to close loans on  the automatic basis who subsequently fails to meet the requirements of  this section must report to VA the circumstances surrounding the  deficiency and the remedial action to be taken to cure it. Failure to  advise VA in a timely manner could result in a lender's loss of its   approval to close VA loans on the automatic basis.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em> must be recertified annually for  authority to process loans on the automatic basis. The following minimum  annual recertification requirements must be met by each lender approved  for automatic authority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial requirements. A lender must submit, within 120 days  following the end of its fiscal year, an audited and certified financial  statement with a classified balance sheet or a separate footnote for  adjusted net worth to VA Central Office (264) for review. The same  minimum financial requirements described in Sec. 36.4352(b)(5) must be  maintained and verified annually in order to be recertified for  automatic authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Processing annual lender data. The VA regional office having  jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office will mail an annual  notice to the lender requesting current information on the lender's  personnel and operation. The lender is required to complete the form and  return it with the appropriate annual renewal fees to the VA regional  office.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lender fees. To participate as a VA automatic lender, non- supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) shall  pay fees as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> $500 for new applications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> $200 for reinstatement of lapsed or terminated automatic  authority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> $100 for each underwriter approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> $100 for each agent approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A minimum fee of $100 for any other VA administrative action  pertaining to a lender's status as an automatic lender;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> $200 annually for certification of home offices; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> $100 annually for each agent renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Supervised lender fees. Supervised lenders of the classes  described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 38 U.S. Code 3702  participating in VA's Loan Guaranty Program shall pay fees as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> $100 fee for each agent approval; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> $100 annually for each agent renewal.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and 3703(c)(1))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> LAPP fees. Lenders participating in VA's Lender Appraisal  Processing Program shall pay a fee of $100 for approval of each staff  appraisal reviewer.   (Authority 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))  [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010,  as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]</p>
