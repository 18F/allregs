                            <p class="depth0">Each season prior to making any recommendations pursuant to Sec. 915.50, the committee shall submit to the Secretary a report setting forth its marketing policy for the ensuing season. Such marketing policy report shall contain information relative to (a) the estimated total production of avocados within the production area; (b) the expected general quality and maturity of avocados in the production area and in competing areas; (c) the expected demand conditions for avocados in different market outlets; (d) the expected shipments of avocados produced in the production area and competing areas; (e) supplies of competing commodities; (f) trend and level of consumer income; (g) other factors having a bearing on the marketing of avocados; and (h) the type of regulations expected to be recommended during the season. In the event it becomes advisable, because of changes in the supply and demand situation for avocados, to modify substantially such marketing policy, the committee shall submit to the Secretary a revised marketing policy report setting forth the information prescribed in this section. The committee shall publicly announce the contents of each marketing policy report and copies thereof shall be maintained in the offices of the committee where they shall be

available for examination by growers and handlers.
