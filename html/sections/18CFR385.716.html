To the extent permitted by law, the presiding  officer or the Commission may, for good cause under paragraph (c) of  this section, reopen the evidentiary record in a proceeding for the  purpose of taking additional evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By motion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any participant may file a motion to reopen the  record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any motion to reopen must set forth clearly the facts sought to  be proven and the reasons claimed to constitute grounds for reopening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A participant who does not file an answer to any motion to  reopen will be deemed to have waived any objection to the motion  provided that no other participant has raised the same objection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> By action of the presiding officer or the Commission. If the  presiding officer or the Commission, as appropriate, has reason to  believe that reopening of a proceeding is warranted by any changes in  conditions of fact or of law or by the public interest, the record in  the proceeding may be reopened by the presiding officer before the  initial or revised initial decision is served or by the Commission after  the initial decision or, if appropriate, the revised initial decision is  served.
