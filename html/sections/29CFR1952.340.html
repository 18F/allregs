                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan identifies the Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety Commission as the agency to be responsible for administering the plan throughout the State. The Commission will be responsible for promulgating and enforcing occupational safety and health standards and deciding contested cases, subject to judicial review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State program will protect all employees within the State, including those employed by the State and its political subdivisions. Public employees are to be granted the same protections as are afforded employees in the private sector. The State plan does not cover employees of the Federal government or those employees whose

working conditions are regulated by Federal agencies other than the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety Act gives the State agency full authority to administer and to enforce all laws, rules, and orders protecting employee safety and health in all places of employment in the State. The legislation provides employer and employee representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors before or during the physical inspection of any workplace for the purpose of aiding such inspection; adequate safeguards to protect trade secrets; effective sanctions against employers; protection of employees against discharge or discrimination; procedures for prompt restraint or elimination of imminent danger situations; the right to review by employers and employees of alleged violations, abatement periods and proposed penalties; and prompt notice to employers and employees of alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative regulations include procedures for permanent and temporary variances; notice to employees or their representatives when no compliance action is taken as a result of a complaint, including procedures for informal review; information to employees on hazards, precautions, symptoms and emergency treatment; and training and education programs for employers and employees, including an on-site consultation program consistent with the criteria set out in the Washington Plan decision (38 FR 2421).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State intends to promulgate Federal standards covering all of the issues contained in parts 1910 and 1926 of this chapter but will not cover those found in parts 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918 of this chapter (ship repairing, ship building, ship breaking, and longshoring). The State also plans to adopt additional vertical standards relating to oil well drilling and servicing not provided by the Federal program. Future Federal standards shall be promulgated by the State within six months after promulgation by the Secretary of Labor. In the case of product standards the State has provided assurances that any State product standards will be required by compelling local conditions and will not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The plan sets out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full conformity with part 1902 of this chapter. All personnel employed to carry out the plan are to be hired under the Wyoming Personnel Merit System which conforms to standards established by the United States Civil Service Commission. The plan also contains a detailed description of the resources that are to be devoted to it.
