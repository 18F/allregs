                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the extent to which Price Cap Carriers may recover certain revenues, through the recovery mechanism outlined below, to implement reforms adopted in FCC 11-161 and as required by Sec. 20.11(b) of this chapter, and Sec. Sec. 51.705 and 51.907.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section and Sec. 51.917, the following terms mean:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CALLS Study Area. A CALLS Study Area means a Price Cap Carrier study area that participated in the CALLS plan at its inception. See Access Charge Reform, Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers, Low-Volume Long-Distance Users, Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Sixth Report and Order in CC Docket Nos. 96-262 and 94-1, Report and Order in CC Docket No. 99-249, Eleventh Report and Order in CC Docket No. 96-45, 15 FCC Rcd 12962 (2000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CALLS Study Area Base Factor. The CALLS Study Area Base Factor is equal to ninety (90) percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> CMRS Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues. CMRS Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues means the reduction in net reciprocal compensation revenues required by Sec. 20.11 of this chapter associated with CMRS traffic as described in Sec. 51.701(b)(2), which is equal to its Fiscal Year 2011 net reciprocal compensation revenues from CMRS carriers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expected Revenues for Access Recovery Charges. Expected Revenues for Access Recovery Charges are calculated using the tariffed Access Recovery Charge rate for each class of service and the forecast demand for each class of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Initial Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. Initial Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate means Fiscal Year 2011 terminating interstate End Office Access Service revenue divided by Fiscal Year 2011 terminating interstate end office switching minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Lifeline Customer. A Lifeline Customer is a residential lifeline subscriber as defined by Sec. 54.400(a) of this chapter that does not pay a Residential and/or Single-Line Business End User Common Line Charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Net Reciprocal Compensation. Net Reciprocal Compensation means the difference between a carrier's reciprocal compensation revenues from non-access traffic less its reciprocal compensation payments for non-access traffic during a stated period of time. For purposes of the calculations made under Sec. Sec. 51.915 and 51.917, the term does not include reciprocal compensation revenues for non-access traffic exchanged between Local Exchange Carriers and CMRS providers; recovery for such traffic is addressed separately in these sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Non-CALLS Study Area. Non-CALLS Study Area means a Price Cap Carrier study area that did not participate in the CALLS plan at its inception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Non-CALLS Study Area Base Factor. The Non-CALLS Study Area Base Factor is equal to one hundred (100) percent for five (5) years beginning July 1, 2012. Beginning July 1, 2017, the Non-CALLS Price Cap Carrier Base Factor will be equal to ninety (90) percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor. The Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor, as used in calculating eligible recovery, is equal to ninety (90) percent for the one-year period beginning July 1, 2012. It is reduced by ten (10) percent of its previous value in each subsequent annual tariff filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Rate Ceiling Component Charges. The Rate Ceiling Component Charges consists of the federal end user common line charge and the Access Recovery Charge; the flat rate for residential local service (sometimes know as the ``1FR'' or ``R1'' rate), mandatory extended area service charges, and state subscriber line charges; per-line state high cost and/or state access replacement universal service contributions, state E911 charges, and state TRS charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Residential Rate Ceiling. The Residential Rate Ceiling, which consists of the total of the Rate Ceiling Component Charges, is set at $30 per month. The Residential Rate Ceiling will be the higher of the rate in effect on January 1, 2012, or the rate in effect on January 1 in any subsequent year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge. True-up revenues for Access Recovery Charge are equal to (projected demand minus actual realized demand for Access Recovery Charges) times the tariffed Access Recovery Charge. This calculation shall be made separately for each class of service and shall be adjusted to reflect any changes in tariffed rates for the Access Recovery Charge. Realized demand is the demand for which payment has been received by the time the true-up is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Intrastate 2014 Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. The Intrastate 2014 Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate as used in this section is determined by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a separate terminating rate is not already generally available, developing separate intrastate originating and terminating end office rates in accordance with Sec. 51.907(d)(1) using end office access rates at their June 30, 2014, rate caps;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiplying the existing terminating June 30, 2014, intrastate end office access rates, or the terminating rates developed in paragraph (b)(14)(i) of this section, by the relevant Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate demand; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dividing the sum of the revenues determined in paragraph (b)(14)(ii) of this section by 2011 Fiscal Year intrastate terminating local switching minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> 2011 Price Cap Carrier Base Period Revenue. 2011 Price Cap Carrier Base Period Revenue is equal to the sum of the following three components:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terminating interstate end office switched access revenues and interstate Tandem-Switched Transport Access Service revenues for Fiscal Year 2011 received by March 31, 2012;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Year 2011 revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service received by March 31, 2012; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fiscal Year 2011 reciprocal compensation revenues received by March 31, 2012, less fiscal year 2011 reciprocal compensation payments made by March 31, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligible recovery for Price Cap Carriers.
