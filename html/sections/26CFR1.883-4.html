                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A foreign corporation satisfies the stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2) if more than 50 percent of the value of its outstanding shares is owned, or treated as owned by applying the attribution rules of paragraph (c) of this section, for at least half of the number of days in the foreign corporation's taxable year by one or more qualified shareholders, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. A shareholder may be a qualified shareholder with respect to one category of income while not being a qualified shareholder with respect to another. A foreign corporation will not be considered to satisfy the stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2) pursuant to this section unless the foreign corporation meets the substantiation and reporting requirements

of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualified shareholder--(1) General rule.

An individual described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section is a resident of a qualified foreign country only if the individual is fully liable to tax as a resident in such country (e.g., an individual who is liable to tax on a remittance basis in a foreign country will not be treated as a resident of that country unless all residents of that country are taxed on a remittance basis only) and, in addition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An individual described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section is a resident of a qualified foreign country only if the individual is fully liable to tax as a resident in such country (e.g., an individual who is liable to tax on a remittance basis in a foreign country will not be treated as a resident of that country unless all residents of that country are taxed on a remittance basis only) and, in addition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual has a tax home, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, in that qualified foreign country for 183 days or more of the taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual is treated as a resident of a qualified foreign country based on special rules pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tax home. For purposes of this section, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of his business (or lack of a business), then the individual's tax home is located at his regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense. If an individual has no regular or principal place of business and no regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense in a qualified foreign country for 183 days or more of the taxable year, that individual does not have a tax home for purposes of this section. A foreign estate or trust, as defined in section 7701(a)(31), does not have a tax home for purposes of this section. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for alternative rules in the case of trusts or estates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain income tax convention restrictions applied to shareholders. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a shareholder described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be considered a resident of, or organized in, a qualified foreign country if that foreign country provides an exemption by means of an income tax convention with the United States, but only if the shareholder demonstrates that it is treated as a resident of that country under the convention and qualifies for

benefits under any Limitation on Benefits article, and that the convention provides an exemption for the relevant category of income. If the convention has a requirement in the shipping and air transport article other than residence, such as place of registration or documentation of the ship or aircraft, the shareholder is not required to demonstrate that the corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status could satisfy any such additional requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Not-for-profit organizations. The term not-for-profit organization means an organization that meets the following requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is a corporation, association taxable as a corporation, trust, fund, foundation, league or other entity operated exclusively for religious, charitable, educational, or recreational purposes, and not organized for profit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is generally exempt from tax in its country of organization by virtue of its not-for-profit status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> More than 50 percent of its annual support is expended on behalf of individuals described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section (see paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section for special rules to substantiate the residence of individual beneficiaries of not-for-profit organizations) and on behalf of U.S. exempt organizations that have received determination letters under section 501(c)(3); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> More than 50 percent of its annual support is derived from individuals described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section (see paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section for special rules to substantiate the residence of individual supporters of not-for-profit organizations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pension funds--(i) Pension fund defined. The term pension fund shall mean a government pension fund or a nongovernment pension fund, as those terms are defined, respectively, in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, that is a trust, fund, foundation, or other entity that is established exclusively for the benefit of employees or former employees of one or more employers, the principal purpose of which is to provide retirement, disability, and death benefits to beneficiaries of such entity and persons designated by such beneficiaries in consideration for prior services rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pension fund defined. The term pension fund shall mean a government pension fund or a nongovernment pension fund, as those terms are defined, respectively, in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, that is a trust, fund, foundation, or other entity that is established exclusively for the benefit of employees or former employees of one or more employers, the principal purpose of which is to provide retirement, disability, and death benefits to beneficiaries of such entity and persons designated by such beneficiaries in consideration for prior services rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Government pension funds. A government pension fund is a pension fund that is a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign within the principles of Sec. 1.892-2T(c)(1) (relating to pension funds established for the benefit of employees or former employees of a foreign government).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nongovernment pension funds. A nongovernment pension fund is a pension fund that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is administered in a foreign country and is subject to supervision or regulation by a governmental authority (or other authority delegated to perform such supervision or regulation by a governmental authority) in such country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is generally exempt from income taxation in its country of administration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has 100 or more beneficiaries; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The trustees, directors or other administrators of which pension fund provide the documentation required in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Beneficiary of a pension fund. The term beneficiary of a pension fund shall mean any person who has made contributions to a pension fund, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, or on whose behalf contributions have been made, and who is currently receiving retirement, disability, or death benefits from the pension fund or can reasonably be expected to receive such benefits in the future, whether or not the person's right to receive benefits from the fund has vested. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section for rules regarding the computation of stock ownership through nongovernment pension funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules for determining constructive ownership (1) General rules for attribution. For purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section and the exception to the closely-held test in Sec. 1.883-1(d)(3)(ii), stock owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or mutual insurance company or similar entity shall be treated as owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, grantors, or other interest holders, as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (7) of this section.

The proportionate interest rules of this paragraph (c) shall apply successively upward through the chain of ownership, and a person's proportionate interest shall be computed for the relevant days or period taken into account in determining whether a foreign corporation satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Stock treated as owned by a person by reason of this paragraph (c) shall be treated as actually owned by such person for purposes of this section. An owner of an interest in an association taxable as a corporation shall be treated as a shareholder of such association for purposes of this paragraph (c). Stock issued in bearer form will not be treated as owned proportionately by its shareholders unless the shares are maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in Sec. 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partnerships--(i) General rule. A partner shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a partnership in proportion to the least of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A partner shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a partnership in proportion to the least of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of the partnership's dividend income from the stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of gain from disposition of the stock by the partnership; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of the stock (or proceeds from the disposition of the stock) upon liquidation of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partners resident in the same country. For purposes of this paragraph, all qualified shareholders that are partners in a partnership and that are residents of, or organized in, the same qualified foreign country shall be treated as one partner. Thus, the percentage distributive shares of dividend income, gain and liquidation rights of all qualified shareholders that are partners in a partnership and that are residents of, or organized in, the same qualified foreign country are aggregated prior to determining the least of the three percentages set out in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. For the meaning of the term resident, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Stock held solely by qualified shareholders through a partnership. Country X grants an equivalent exemption. A and B are individual residents of Country X and are qualified shareholders within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A and B are the sole partners of Partnership P. P's only asset is the stock of Corporation Z, a Country X corporation seeking a reciprocal exemption under this section. A's distributive share of P's income and gain on the disposition of P's assets is 80 percent, but A's distributive share of P's assets (or the proceeds therefrom) on P's liquidation is 20 percent. B's distributive share of P's income and gain is 20 percent and B is entitled to 80 percent of the assets (or proceeds therefrom) on P's liquidation. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, A and B will be treated as a single partner owning in the aggregate 100 percent of the stock of Z owned by P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Stock held by both qualified and nonqualified shareholders through a partnership. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that C, an individual who is not a resident of a qualified foreign country, is also a partner in P and that C's distributive share of P's income is 60 percent. The distributive shares of A and B are the same as in Example 1, except that A's distributive share of income is 20 percent. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, qualified shareholders A and B will be treated as a single partner owning in the aggregate 40 percent of the stock of Z owned by P (i.e., the lowest aggregate percentage of A and B's distributive shares of dividend income (40 percent), gain (100 percent), and liquidation rights (100 percent) with respect to the Z stock). Thus, only 40 percent of the Z stock is treated as owned by qualified shareholders.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Stock held through tiered partnerships. Country X grants an equivalent exemption. A and B are individual residents of Country X and are qualified shareholders within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A and B are the sole partners of Partnership P. P is a partner in Partnership P1, which owns the stock of Corporation Z, a Country X corporation seeking a reciprocal exemption under this section. Assume that P's distributive share of the dividend income, gain and liquidation rights with respect to the Z stock held by P1 is 40 percent. Assume that of the remaining partners of P1 only D is a qualified shareholder. D's distributive share of P1's dividend income and gain is 15 percent; D's distributive share of P1's assets on liquidation is 25 percent. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, A and B, treated as a single partner, will own 40 percent of the Z stock owned by P1 (100 percent x 40 percent) and D will be treated as owning 15 percent of

the Z stock owned by P1 (the least of D's dividend income (15 percent), gain (15 percent), and liquidation rights (25 percent) with respect to the Z stock). Thus, 55 percent of the Z stock owned by P1 is treated as owned by qualified shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trusts and estates--(i) Beneficiaries. In general, an individual shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust or estate in proportion to the individual's actuarial interest in the trust or estate, as provided in section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), except that an income beneficiary's actuarial interest in the trust will be determined as if the trust's only asset were the stock. The interest of a remainder beneficiary in stock will be equal to 100 percent minus the sum of the percentages of any interest in the stock held by income beneficiaries. The ownership of an interest in stock owned by a trust shall not be attributed to any beneficiary whose interest cannot be determined under the preceding sentence, and any such interest, to the extent not attributed by reason of this paragraph (c)(3)(i), shall not be considered owned by a beneficiary unless all potential beneficiaries with respect to the stock are qualified shareholders. In addition, a beneficiary's actuarial interest will be treated as zero to the extent that someone other than the beneficiary is treated as owning the stock under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A substantially separate and independent share of a trust, within the meaning of section 663(c), shall be treated as a separate trust for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i), provided that payment of income, accumulated income or corpus of a share of one beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) cannot affect the proportionate share of income, accumulated income or corpus of another beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Beneficiaries. In general, an individual shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust or estate in proportion to the individual's actuarial interest in the trust or estate, as provided in section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), except that an income beneficiary's actuarial interest in the trust will be determined as if the trust's only asset were the stock. The interest of a remainder beneficiary in stock will be equal to 100 percent minus the sum of the percentages of any interest in the stock held by income beneficiaries. The ownership of an interest in stock owned by a trust shall not be attributed to any beneficiary whose interest cannot be determined under the preceding sentence, and any such interest, to the extent not attributed by reason of this paragraph (c)(3)(i), shall not be considered owned by a beneficiary unless all potential beneficiaries with respect to the stock are qualified shareholders. In addition, a beneficiary's actuarial interest will be treated as zero to the extent that someone other than the beneficiary is treated as owning the stock under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A substantially separate and independent share of a trust, within the meaning of section 663(c), shall be treated as a separate trust for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i), provided that payment of income, accumulated income or corpus of a share of one beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) cannot affect the proportionate share of income, accumulated income or corpus of another beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grantor trusts. A person is treated as the owner of stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust to the extent that the stock is included in the portion of the trust that is treated as owned by the person under sections 671 through 679 (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Corporations that issue stock. A shareholder of a corporation that issues stock shall be treated as owning stock of a foreign corporation that is owned by such corporation on any day in a proportion that equals the value of the stock owned by such shareholder to the value of all stock of such corporation. If, however, there is an agreement, express or implied, that a shareholder of a corporation will not receive distributions from the earnings of stock owned by the corporation, the shareholder will not be treated as owning that stock owned by the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Taxable nonstock corporations. A taxable nonstock corporation that is entitled in its country of organization to deduct from its taxable income amounts distributed for charitable purposes may deem a recipient of such charitable distributions to be a shareholder of such taxable nonstock corporation in the same proportion as the amount that such beneficiary receives in the taxable year bears to the total income of such taxable nonstock corporation in the taxable year. Whether each such recipient is a qualified shareholder may then be determined under paragraph (b) of this section or under the special rules of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Mutual insurance companies and similar entities. Stock held by a mutual insurance company, mutual savings bank, or similar entity (including an association taxable as a corporation that does not issue stock interests) shall be considered owned proportionately by the policyholders, depositors, or other owners in the same proportion that such persons share in the surplus of such entity upon liquidation or dissolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Computation of beneficial interests in nongovernment pension funds. Stock held by a pension fund shall be considered owned by the beneficiaries of the fund equally on a pro-rata basis if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The pension fund meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trustees, directors or other administrators of the pension fund have no knowledge, and no reason to know, that a pro-rata allocation of interests of the fund to all beneficiaries would differ significantly from an actuarial allocation of interests in the fund

(or, if the beneficiaries' actuarial interest in the stock held directly or indirectly by the pension fund differs from the beneficiaries' actuarial interest in the pension fund, the actuarial interests computed by reference to the beneficiaries' actuarial interest in the stock);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any overfunding of the pension fund would be payable, pursuant to the governing instrument or the laws of the foreign country in which the pension fund is administered, only to, or for the benefit of, one or more corporations that are organized in the country in which the pension fund is administered, individual beneficiaries of the pension fund or their designated beneficiaries, or social or charitable causes (the reduction of the obligation of the sponsoring company or companies to make future contributions to the pension fund by reason of overfunding shall not itself result in such overfunding being deemed to be payable to or for the benefit of such company or companies); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The foreign country in which the pension fund is administered has laws that are designed to prevent overfunding of a pension fund and the funding of the pension fund is within the guidelines of such laws; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The pension fund is maintained to provide benefits to employees in a particular industry, profession, or group of industries or professions and employees of at least 10 companies (other than companies that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same interests) contribute to the pension fund or receive benefits from the pension fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The trustees, directors or other administrators provide the relevant documentation as required in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Substantiation of stock ownership-- (1) General rule. A foreign corporation that relies on this section to satisfy the stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2), must establish all the facts necessary to satisfy the Commissioner that more than 50 percent of the value of its shares is owned, or treated as owned applying paragraph (c) of this section, by qualified shareholders for the relevant period. If a foreign corporation relies upon bearer shares in the chain of ownership to satisfy one of the stock ownership tests, the foreign corporation must also establish all of the facts necessary to satisfy the Commissioner that such shares are maintained in a dematerialized book-entry system, as described in Sec. 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G), for the benefit of the relevant shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A foreign corporation that relies on this section to satisfy the stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2), must establish all the facts necessary to satisfy the Commissioner that more than 50 percent of the value of its shares is owned, or treated as owned applying paragraph (c) of this section, by qualified shareholders for the relevant period. If a foreign corporation relies upon bearer shares in the chain of ownership to satisfy one of the stock ownership tests, the foreign corporation must also establish all of the facts necessary to satisfy the Commissioner that such shares are maintained in a dematerialized book-entry system, as described in Sec. 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G), for the benefit of the relevant shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of general rule--(i) Ownership statements.

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a person shall only be treated as a qualified shareholder of a foreign corporation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the relevant period, the person completes an ownership statement described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section or has a valid ownership statement in effect under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a person owning stock in the foreign corporation indirectly through one or more intermediaries (including mere legal owners or recordholders acting as nominees), each intermediary in the chain of ownership between that person and the foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status completes an intermediary ownership statement described in paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section or has a valid intermediary ownership statement in effect under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status obtains the statements described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Three-year period of validity. The ownership statements required in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall remain valid until the earlier of the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the ownership statement is signed, or the day that a change of circumstance occurs that makes any information on the ownership statement incorrect. For example, an ownership statement signed on September 30, 2000, remains valid through December 31, 2003, unless a change of circumstance occurs that makes any information on the ownership statement incorrect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules--(i) Substantiating residence of certain shareholders. A foreign

corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status or an intermediary that is a direct or indirect shareholder of such foreign corporation may substantiate the residence of certain shareholders, for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, under one of the following special rules in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) through (viii) of this section, in lieu of obtaining the ownership statements required in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section from such shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantiating residence of certain shareholders. A foreign

corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status or an intermediary that is a direct or indirect shareholder of such foreign corporation may substantiate the residence of certain shareholders, for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, under one of the following special rules in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) through (viii) of this section, in lieu of obtaining the ownership statements required in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section from such shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for registered shareholders owning less than one percent of widely-held corporations. A foreign corporation with at least 250 registered shareholders, that is not a publicly-traded corporation, as described in Sec. 1.883-2 (a widely-held corporation), is not required to obtain an ownership statement from an individual shareholder owning less than one percent of the widely-held corporation at all times during the taxable year if the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section are satisfied. If the widely-held foreign corporation is the foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status, or an intermediary that meets the documentation requirements of paragraphs (d)(4)(v)(A) and (B) of this section, the widely-held foreign corporation may treat the address of record in its ownership records as the residence of any less than one percent individual shareholder if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual's address of record is a specific street address and not a nonresidential address, such as a post office box or in care of a financial intermediary or stock transfer agent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The officers and directors of the widely-held corporation neither know nor have reason to know that the individual does not reside at that address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for beneficiaries of pension funds--(A) Government pension fund.

A foreign airline that is covered by a bilateral Air Services Agreement in force between the United States and the qualified foreign country in which the airline is organized may rely exclusively on the Air Services Agreement currently in effect and will not have to otherwise substantiate its ownership under this section, provided that the United States has not waived the ownership requirements in the agreement or that the ownership requirements have not otherwise been made ineffective. Such an airline will be treated as owned by qualified shareholders resident in the country where the foreign airline is organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Special rule for taxable nonstock corporations. Any stock in a foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status that is owned by a taxable nonstock corporation will be treated as owned, in any taxable year, by the recipients of distributions made during that taxable year, as set out in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The taxable nonstock corporation may treat the address of record in its distribution records as the residence of any recipient if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An individual recipient's address is in a qualified foreign country and is a specific street address and not a nonresidential address, such as a post office box or in care of a financial intermediary or stock transfer agent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The address of a nonindividual recipient's principal place of business is in a qualified foreign country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The officers and directors of the taxable nonstock corporation neither know nor have reason to know that the recipients do not reside or have their principal place of business at such addresses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The foreign corporation receives the statement described in paragraph (d)(4)(v)(D) of this section from the taxable nonstock corporation intermediary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Special rule for closely-held corporations traded in the United States.

However, if any class of stock is determined to be closely-held within the meaning of Sec. 1.883-2(d)(3)(i), the publicly traded corporation cannot satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.883-2(e) unless it obtains sufficient documentation described in this paragraph (d) to demonstrate that the requirements of Sec. 1.883-2(d)(3)(ii) are met with respect to the 5-percent shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ownership statements from shareholders--(i) Ownership statements from individuals.
