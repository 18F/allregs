If you use a condenser as the control device to achieve the requirements specified in Sec. 60.5412(a)(2), you must demonstrate compliance according to paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section. You may switch between compliance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section and compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section only after at least 1 year of operation in compliance with the selected approach. You must provide notification of such a change in the compliance method in the next annual report, as required in Sec. 60.5420(b), following the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must operate below (or above) the site specific maximum (or minimum) parameter value established according to the requirements of Sec. 60.5417(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must calculate the daily average of the applicable monitored parameter in accordance with Sec. 60.5417(e) except that the inlet gas flow rate to the control device must not be averaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the daily average of the monitoring parameter value calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is either equal to or greater than the minimum monitoring value or equal to or less than the maximum monitoring value established under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. When performance testing of a combustion control device is conducted by the device manufacturer as specified in Sec. 60.5413(d), compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the criteria in Sec. 60.5413(e) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You must operate the continuous monitoring system required in Sec. 60.5417 at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments). A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other required data collection periods to assess the operation of the control device and associated control system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If you use a combustion control device to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.5412(a) and you demonstrate compliance using the test procedures specified in Sec. 60.5413(b), you must comply with paragraphs (b)(2)(vii)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A pilot flame must be present at all times of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Devices must be operated with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 2 minutes during any hour.

The observation period must be 1 hour and must be conducted according to section 11. of EPA Method 22, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Devices failing the visible emissions test must follow manufacturer's repair instructions, if available, or best combustion engineering practice as outlined in the unit inspection and maintenance plan, to return the unit to compliant operation. All repairs and maintenance activities for each unit must be recorded in a maintenance and repair log and must be available for inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Following return to operation from maintenance or repair activity, each device must pass a Method 22, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, visual observation as described in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If you use a condenser as the control device to achieve the percent reduction performance requirements specified in Sec. 60.5412(a)(2), you must demonstrate compliance using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(2)(viii)(A) through (E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You must establish a site-specific condenser performance curve according to Sec. 60.5417(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You must calculate the daily average condenser outlet temperature in accordance with Sec. 60.5417(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> You must determine the condenser efficiency for the current operating day using the daily average condenser outlet temperature calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(viii)(B) of this section and the condenser performance curve established under paragraph (b)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(viii)(D)(1) and (2) of this section, at the end of each operating day, you must calculate the 365-day rolling average TOC emission reduction, as appropriate, from the condenser efficiencies as determined in paragraph (b)(2)(viii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After the compliance dates specified in Sec. 60.5370, if you have less than 120 days of data for determining average TOC emission reduction, you must calculate the average TOC emission reduction for the first 120 days of operation after the compliance dates. You have demonstrated compliance with the overall 95.0 percent reduction requirement if the 120-day average TOC emission reduction is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After 120 days and no more than 364 days of operation after the compliance date specified in Sec. 60.5370, you must calculate the average TOC emission reduction as the TOC emission reduction averaged over the number of days between the current day and the applicable compliance date.
