                            <p class="depth0">Critical habitat is designated for the Southern Resident killer whale as described in this section. The textual descriptions of critical habitat in this section are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The overview map is provided for general guidance purposes only, and not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat boundaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Critical Habitat Boundaries. Critical habitat includes three specific marine areas of Puget Sound, Washington, within the following counties: Clallam, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Island, Mason, Pierce, San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish,

Thurston, and Whatcom. Critical habitat includes all waters relative to a contiguous shoreline delimited by the line at a depth of 20 feet (6.1 m) relative to extreme high water in each of the following areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Summer Core Area: All U.S. marine waters in Whatcom and San Juan counties; and all marine waters in Skagit County west and north of the Deception Pass Bridge (Highway 20) (48[deg]24[min]25[sec] N./122[deg]38[min]35[sec] W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Puget Sound Area: All marine waters in Island County east and south of the Deception Pass Bridge (Highway 20) (48[deg]24[min]25[sec] N./122[deg]38[min]35[sec] W.), and east of a line connecting the Point Wilson Lighthouse (48[deg]8[min]39[sec] N./122[deg]45[min]12[sec] W.) and a point on Whidbey Island located at 48[deg]12[min]30[sec] N./122[deg]44[min]26[sec] W.; all marine waters in Skagit County east of the Deception Pass Bridge (Highway 20) (48[deg]24[min]25[sec] N./122[deg]38[min]35[sec] W.); all marine waters of Jefferson County east of a line connecting the Point Wilson Lighthouse (48[deg]8[min]39[sec] N./122[deg]45[min]12[sec] W.) and a point on Whidbey Island located at latitude 48[deg]12[min]30[sec] N./122[deg]44[min]26[sec] W., and north of the Hood Canal Bridge (Highway 104) (47[deg]51[min]36[sec] N./122[deg]37[min]23[sec] W.); all marine waters in eastern Kitsap County east of the Hood Canal Bridge (Highway 104) (47[deg]51[min]36[sec] N./122[deg]37[min]23[sec] W.); all marine waters (excluding Hood Canal) in Mason County; and all marine waters in King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Thurston counties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Strait of Juan de Fuca Area: All U.S. marine waters in Clallam County east of a line connecting Cape Flattery, Washington (48[deg]23[min]10[sec] N./124[deg]43[min]32[sec] W.), Tatoosh Island, Washington (48[deg]23[min]30[sec] N./124[deg]44[min]12[sec] W.), and Bonilla Point, British Columbia (48[deg]35[min]30[sec] N./124[deg]43[min]00[sec] W.); all marine waters in Jefferson and Island counties west of the Deception Pass Bridge (Highway 20) (48[deg]24[min]25[sec] N./122[deg]38[min]35[sec] W.), and west of a line connecting the Point Wilson Lighthouse (48[deg]8[min]39[sec] N./122[deg]45[min]12[sec] W.) and a point on Whidbey Island located at 48[deg]12[min]30[sec] N./122[deg]44[min]26[sec] W.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An overview map of final critical habitat for the Southern Resident killer whale follows.
