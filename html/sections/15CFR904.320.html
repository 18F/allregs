A permit may be cancelled, with or without prejudice  to issuance of the permit in the future. Additional requirements for  issuance of any future permit may be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension. A permit may be suspended either for a specified  period of time or until stated requirements are met, or both. If  contingent on stated requirements being met, the suspension is with  prejudice to issuance of any permit until the requirements are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Modification. A permit may be modified, as by imposing  additional conditions and restrictions. If the permit was issued for a  foreign fishing vessel under section 204(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery Conservation and   Management Act, additional conditions and restrictions may be imposed on  the application of the foreign nation involved and on any permits issued  under such application.</p>
