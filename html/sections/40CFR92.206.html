In lieu of providing the emission data required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator may, upon request of the manufacturer or remanufacturer, allow the manufacturer or remanufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous emission tests, development tests, or other testing information) that the engine or locomotive will conform with the applicable emission standards of Sec. 92.8.
