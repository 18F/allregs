In this situation, absent the appointment of a guardian or other party to manage the financial affairs of the claimant by a court or administrative body authorized to do so, OWCP in its sole discretion may approve a person to serve as the representative payee for funds due the beneficiary. Where a guardian or other party has been appointed by a court or administrative body authorized to do so to manage the financial affairs of the claimant, OWCP will recognize that individual as the representative payee.</p>
