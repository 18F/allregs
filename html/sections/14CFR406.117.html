                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing confidential information. If a party wants certain  information that the party is filing not made available to the public,  the party must do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Place the information in a separate sealed envelope and clearly  mark the envelope ``CONFIDENTIAL.'' At least the first page of the  document in the envelope also must be marked ``CONFIDENTIAL.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attach to this envelope a cover document marked ``Confidential  information filed with administrative law judge'' or ``Confidential  information filed with Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation.'' The  cover document must include, at the least, a short statement of what is  being filed, such as ``Respondent's motion for confidentiality order.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless such a motion has already been granted, enclose a motion  for confidentiality order in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section. The motion must be in the sealed envelope if it contains  confidential information; otherwise the motion must be outside of the  sealed envelope.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Marked information not made public. If a party files a document  in a sealed envelope clearly marked ``CONFIDENTIAL'' the document may  not be made available to the public unless and until the administrative  law judge or the FAA decisionmaker decides it may be made available to  the public in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 50916.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motion for confidentiality order. If a party is filing, is  requested to provide in discovery, or intends to offer at the hearing,  information that the party does not wish to be available to the public,  the party must file a motion for a confidentiality order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The party must state the specific grounds for withholding the  information from the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the party claims that the information is protected under 51  U.S.C. 50916, and if both the complainant and the respondent agree that  the information is protected under that section, the administrative law  judge must grant the motion. If one party does not agree that the  information is protected under 51 U.S.C. 50916 the administrative law  judge must decide. Either party may file an interlocutory appeal of  right under Sec. 406.173(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the party claims that the information should be protected on  grounds other than those provided by 51 U.S.C. 50916 the administrative  law judge must grant the motion if, based on the motion and any response  to the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure  would be detrimental to safety, disclosure would not be in the public  interest, or that   the information is not otherwise required to be made available to the  public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the administrative law judge determines that the information  is not necessary to decide the case or would not otherwise lead to the  discovery of relevant material, the administrative law judge must  preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the administrative law judge determines that the requested  material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge  may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under  limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the administrative law judge determines that the requested  material is necessary to decide the case, or would otherwise lead to the  discovery of relevant material, and that a confidentiality order is  warranted, the administrative law judge must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide an opportunity for review of the document by the  attorneys of record off the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide procedures for excluding the information from the  record, or order that portion of the record that includes confidential  information be closed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Order that the parties must not disclose the information in  any manner and the parties must not use the information in any other  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If an administrative law judge orders a record closed, in whole  or in part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The closed record is not available to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The closed record is available to the parties' attorneys of  record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The administrative law judge may determine whether the closed  record is available to the parties, the parties' representatives, or  other persons such as witnesses for a party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No party, attorney of record, representative of record, or  person who receives information from such persons, may disclose  information that has been protected under this section except to a  person authorized by this section or the administrative law judge to  receive it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a person other than one authorized by this section desires to  view or copy a closed record, the person must file a motion to open the  record.
