                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The idle emission test procedure is designed to determine the raw concentration (in percent) of CO in the exhaust flow at idle. The test procedure begins with the engine at normal operating temperature. (For example, the warm-up for an engine may be the transient engine or chassis dynamometer test.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Raw emission sampling must be made before dilution occurs from a single exhaust pipe in which exhaust products are homogeneously mixed. The configuration for dual-exhaust systems must also allow for raw emission measurements, which will require that an additional ``Y'' pipe be placed in the exhaust system before dilution.
