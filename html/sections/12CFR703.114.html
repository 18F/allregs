During this period, however, the Federal credit union may terminate existing derivatives transactions. NCUA may permit a Federal credit union to enter into offsetting transactions if NCUA determines these transactions are part of a corrective action strategy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within three business days from the regulatory violation, provide the appropriate field director notification of the regulatory violation, which must include a description of the violation and the immediate corrective action the Federal credit union is taking; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Within 15 business days after notifying the appropriate field director, submit a written corrective action plan to the appropriate field director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> NCUA may revoke a Federal credit union's derivatives authority at any time if a Federal credit union fails to comply with the requirements of this

subpart. Revocation will prohibit a Federal credit union from executing any new derivatives transactions under this subpart, and may require the Federal credit union to terminate existing derivatives transactions if, in the discretion of the applicable field director, doing so would not pose a safety and soundness concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Within 60 days from the date of the related field director's action, a Federal credit union may appeal the following to the NCUA Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NCUA's revocation of a Federal credit union's derivatives authority; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NCUA's order that a Federal credit union terminate existing derivatives positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> With respect to an appeal regarding revocation of a Federal credit union's derivatives authority, the Federal credit union may not enter into any new derivatives transactions until the NCUA Board renders a final decision on the appeal.

The WARMN calculation adjusts the gross notional of a derivative to take into account its price sensitivity and remaining maturity. The WARMN limit is correlated to the fair value loss limit, as described in paragraph (a) of this appendix, for a 300 basis point parallel shift in interest rates. To demonstrate compliance with the WARMN limit authority of this subpart, a Federal credit union must calculate the WARMN using the following reference table, definitions, and calculation steps:</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Summary of WARMN Calculation----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Adjustment</p><p class="depth0">Product               Step 1 gross      factor       Step 2 adjusted           Step 3 WARM</p><p class="depth0">notional        (percent)         notional----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Options (Caps).................

Sum = Total         Sum = Overall WARM</p><p class="depth0">Adjusted Notional.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Step 4 WARMN = Adjusted Notional x (WARM/10)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step 1--Calculate the gross notional of all outstanding derivative transactions. (i) For options and swaps, all gross notional amounts must be absolute, with no netting (i.e., offsetting a pay-fixed transaction with a receive-fixed transaction). The gross notional for derivatives transactions with amortizing notional amounts is the current contracted notional amount, in accordance with the amortization schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For futures, the gross notional is the underlying contract size as designated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) product specifications (e.g., a five-year Treasury note futures contract will use $100,000 for each contract purchased or sold and reported here on a gross basis for limit purposes.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2--Convert each gross notional by its derivative adjustment factor to produce an adjusted gross notional. The derivative adjustment factor approximates the price sensitivity for each of the product groups in order to weight the notional amount by sensitivity before weighting for maturity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For cap and floor options, the derivative adjustment factor is 33 percent. For example, an interest rate cap with a $1 million notional amount has an adjusted gross notional of $330,000 ($1,000,000 x 0.33 + $330,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For interest rate swaps and Treasury futures, the derivative adjustment factor is 100 percent. For example, an interest rate swap with a $1 million notional amount has an adjusted gross notional of $1,000,000 ($1,000,000 x 1.00 = $1,000,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The total adjusted notional for all derivatives positions is the sum of (i) and (ii) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 3--Produce the weighted average remaining time to maturity (WARM) for all derivatives positions. (i) For interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and interest rate swaps, the remaining maturity is the time left between the reporting date and the contracted maturity date, expressed in years (round up to two decimals);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For Treasury futures, the remaining maturity is the underlying deliverable Treasury note's maximum maturity (e.g., a five-year Treasury note future has a five-year remaining maturity); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the WARM using the adjusted gross notional, as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, and the remaining time to maturity as defined for each product group above in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 4--Produce the WARMN by converting the WARM to a percentage and then multiplying the percentage by the total adjusted gross notional. (i) Divide the WARM, as calculated in paragraph (b)(3) of this appendix, by ten to convert it to a percentage (e.g., 7.75 WARMN is translated to 77.5 percent); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiply the WARM converted to a percentage, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this appendix, by total adjusted gross notional, described in paragraph (c)(2) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Compare WARMN calculation to the WARNM limit for compliance. The total in step four (4) must be less than the limit in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) of this appendix, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example calculations for compliance with this subpart: WARMN. The table below provides an illustrative example of the WARMN limit calculations for a sample Federal credit union that has entry level authority. The sample Federal credit union has a net worth of $100 million and total assets of $1 billion;

its notional limit authority is $65 million (65 percent of net worth).</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Example WARMN Limit Calculation----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Options            Swaps            Futures            Total----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gross Notional (Step 1)................      $100,000,000       $50,000,000        $5,000,000      $155,000,000Adjustment Factor.......................               33%              100%              100%Adjusted Notional (Step 2).............       $33,000,000       $50,000,000        $5,000,000       $88,000,000Weighted Average Remaining Maturity                   7.00              8.50              5.00              7.74</p><p class="depth0"><em>(WARM)</em> (Step 3).......................----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Weighted Average Remaining       \1\ $68,100,000</p><p class="depth0">Maturity Notional (WARMN) (Step</p><p class="depth0">4):</p><p class="depth0">Notional Limit Authority (65% of        $65,000,000</p><p class="depth0">net worth)</p><p class="depth0">Under/(Over) Notional Limit         ($3,100,000)</p><p class="depth0">Authority----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ (77.4% of Step 3.)</p>
