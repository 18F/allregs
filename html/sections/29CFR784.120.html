                                Sec. 784.120  Application of exemption to ``offshore'' activities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The expression ``offshore activities'' is used to describe the  category of named operations pertaining to the acquisition from nature  of aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life. As originally enacted in  1938, section 13(a)(5) exempted not only employees employed in such  ``offshore'' or ``trip'' activities but also employees employed in  related activities on shore which were similarly affected by the natural  factors previously discussed (see Sec. 784.103, and Fleming v. Hawkeye  Pearl Button Co., 113 F. 2d 52). However, the intent of the 1961  amendments to the Act was to remove from the exemption the so-called  onshore activities and ``leave the exemption applicable to `offshore'  activities connected with the procurement of the aquatic products'' (S.  Rep. 145, 87th Cong., first session, p. 33). Despite its comprehensive  reach (see Sec. Sec. 784.105 and 784.106), the exemption, like the  similar exemption is the Act for agriculture, is ``meant to apply only''  to the activities named in the statute (see Maneja v. Waialua, 349 U.S.  254; Farmers Reservoir Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755).</p>
