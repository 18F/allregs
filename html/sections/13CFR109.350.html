                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The ILP Intermediary must maintain a reasonable loan loss reserve  appropriate for the quality of the ILP Intermediary's portfolio in a  federally insured depository account established by the ILP Intermediary  at a well-capitalized financial institution. The loan loss reserve must  be in an account separate and distinct from the ILP Intermediary's other  assets and financial activities. This reserve must be maintained at not  less than 5% of the principal balance of all outstanding loans to  Eligible Small Business Concerns made from the ILP Relending Fund. The  AA/CA or designee may require the ILP Intermediary to maintain a larger  loss reserve if the AA/CA determines that the ILP Intermediary's loss  reserve level is potentially inadequate to protect SBA from loss. ILP  Relending Fund proceeds must not be used to establish or maintain the  loan loss reserve.</p>
