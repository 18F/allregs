                            <p class="depth0">Generally, it is more advantageous to agencies if GSA backorders  requisitions for out-of-stock items rather than cancels requisitions.  Unless notified by agencies not to backorder a requisition, through  FEDSTRIP advice codes 2C or 2J, a back order will be established. The  agency will be notified of the estimated date that shipment will be  made. Upon receipt of the status transaction, the agency shall determine  if the estimated shipping date will meet its needs and, as appropriate:  (a) Accept the back order, (b) request a suitable substitute item, or  (c) request cancellation in accordance with Sec. 101-26.309.
