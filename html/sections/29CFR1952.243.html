                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 18(e) of the Act and procedures in 29 CFR part 1902, and after a determination that the State met the ``fully effective'' compliance staffing benchmarks as established in 1980 in response to a Court Order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall, (CA 74-406), and was satisfactorily providing reports to OSHA through participation in the Federal-State Unified Management Information, System, the Assistant Secretary evaluated actual operations under the Alaska State plan for a period of at least one year following certification of completion of developmental steps (Sept. 9, 1977, 42 FR 54905). Based on the Evaluation Report for FY 1983 and available FY 1984 data, and after opportunity for public comment and an informal public hearing held on June 7, 1984 in Anchorage, Alaska, the Assistant Secretary determined that in actual operations, the State of Alaska occupational safety and health program is at least as effective as the Federal program in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment and meets the criteria for final States plan approval in section 18(e) of the Act and implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1902. Accordingly, the Alaska plan was granted final approval and concurrent Federal enforcement authority was relinquised under section 18(e) of the Act effective September 26, 1984.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise noted, the plan which has received final approval covers all activities of employers and all places of employment in Alaska. The plan does not cover:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Private sector maritime employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Worksites located on the navigable waters, including artificial islands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Native health care facilities that are Federally owned and contractor operated, including those owned by the U.S. Department of the Interior--Indian Health Service, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. Department of Commerce--National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and operated by Tribal organizations under contract with the Indian Health Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Operations of private sector employers within the Metlakatla Indian Community on the Annette Islands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Operations of private sector employers within Denali (Mount McKinley) National Park;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Operations of private contractors at Cape Lisburne Long Range Missile Base, Point Lay Short Range Missile Base, Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island, Fort Greeley Missile Defense in Delta Junction, the U.S. Coast Guard Integrated Support Commands in Kodiak and Ketchikan, the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, and the U.S. Coast Guard 17th District Command in Juneau;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Federal government employers and employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The U.S. Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The enforcement of the field sanitation standard, 29 CFR 1928.110, and the enforcement of the temporary labor camps standard, 29 CFR 1910.142, with respect to any agricultural establishment where employees are engaged in ``agricultural employment'' within the meaning of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. 1802(3), regardless of the number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a temporary packing shed, except that Alaska retains enforcement responsibility over agricultural temporary labor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or the post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alaska is required: To maintain a State program which is at least as effective as operations under the Federal program; to submit plan supplements in accordance with 29 CFR part 1953; to allocate sufficient safety and health enforcement staff to meet the benchmarks for State staffing established by the U.S. Department of Labor, or any revisions to those benchmarks; and, to furnish such reports in such form as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
