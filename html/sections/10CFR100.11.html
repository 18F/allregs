                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As an aid in evaluating a proposed site, an applicant should  assume a fission produce release \1\ from the core, the expected  demonstrable leak rate from the containment and the meteorological  conditions pertinent to his site to derive an exclusion area, a low  population zone and population center distance. For the purpose of this  analysis, which shall set forth the basis for the numerical values used,  the applicant should determine the following: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The fission product release assumed for these calculations  should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site  analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental  events, that would result in potential hazards not exceeded by those  from any accident considered credible. Such accidents have generally  been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with  subsequent release of appreciable quantities of fission products. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An exclusion area of such size that an individual located at any  point on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the  postulated fission product release would not receive a total radiation  dose to the whole body in excess of 25 rem \2\ or a   total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem \2\ to the thyroid from iodine  exposure. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ The whole body dose of 25 rem referred to above corresponds  numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for  radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations may be  disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status (see  NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, neither its use nor that  of the 300 rem value for thyroid exposure as set forth in these site  criteria guides are intended to imply that these numbers constitute  acceptable limits for emergency doses to the public under accident  conditions. Rather, this 25 rem whole body value and the 300 rem thyroid  value have been set forth in these guides as reference values, which can  be used in the evaluation of reactor sites with respect to potential  reactor accidents of exceedingly low probability of occurrence, and low  risk of public exposure to radiation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A low population zone of such size that an individual located at  any point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive cloud  resulting from the postulated fission product release (during the entire  period of its passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the  whole body in excess of 25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of  300 rem to the thyroid from iodine exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A population center distance of at least one and one-third times  the distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the low  population zone. In applying this guide, the boundary of the population  center shall be determined upon consideration of population  distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling in the  application of this guide. Where very large cities are involved, a  greater distance may be necessary because of total integrated population  dose consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For sites for multiple reactor facilities consideration should  be given to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the reactors are independent to the extent that an accident  in one reactor would not initiate an accident in another, the size of  the exclusion area, low population zone and population center distance  shall be fulfilled with respect to each reactor individually. The  envelopes of the plan overlay of the areas so calculated shall then be  taken as their respective boundaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the reactors are interconnected to the extent that an  accident in one reactor could affect the safety of operation of any  other, the size of the exclusion area, low population zone and  population center distance shall be based upon the assumption that all  interconnected reactors emit their postulated fission product releases  simultaneously. This requirement may be reduced in relation to the  degree of coupling between reactors, the probability of concomitant  accidents and the probability that an individual would not be exposed to  the radiation effects from simultaneous releases. The applicant would be  expected to justify to the satisfaction of the Commission the basis for  such a reduction in the source term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant is expected to show that the simultaneous  operation of multiple reactors at a site will not result in total  radioactive effluent releases beyond the allowable limits of applicable  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Note: For further guidance in developing the exclusion area, the low  population zone, and the population center distance, reference is made  to Technical Information Document 14844, dated March 23, 1962, which  contains a procedural method and a sample calculation that result in  distances roughly reflecting current siting practices of the Commission.  The calculations described in Technical Information Document 14844 may  be used as a point of departure for consideration of particular site  requirements which may result from evaluation of the characteristics of  a particular reactor, its purpose and method of operation.
