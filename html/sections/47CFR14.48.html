Any party asserting confidentiality for such materials shall so indicate by clearly marking each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary designation is claimed.

Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have been provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon termination of a formal complaint proceeding, including all appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party.
