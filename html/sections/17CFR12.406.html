                                Sec. 12.406  Final decision of the Commission.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opinion and order. Unless the Commission, in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section, orders summary affirmance of the initial  decision, the Commission's opinion and order in a proceeding appealed  pursuant to Sec. 12.401 of these rules shall constitute the  Commission's final decision, effective upon service. On review, the  Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further  proceedings, in whole or in part, the initial decision and make any  findings or conclusions which in its judgment are warranted based on the  record in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Order on summary affirmance. If the Commission, in its opinion,  finds that the result reached in the initial decision is substantially  correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appealing  party raise any important question of law or policy, the Commission may,  by appropriate order, summarily affirm the initial decision and order  without opinion, which shall constitute the Commission's final decision,  effective upon service. Unless the Commission expressly indicates  otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does   not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the initial decision,  including any rationale contained therein, as its opinion and order, and  neither initial decision nor the Commission's order of summary  affirmance shall serve as a Commission precedent in other proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing and service of final decision. The Commission shall, upon  issuance of a final decision pursuant to this Sec. 12.406, file the  final decision with the Proceeding's Clerk, who shall forthwith serve  upon each of the parties a copy of the final decision as well as notice  of the effect of a party's failure to pay a reparation award as provided  in Sec. 12.407 of these rules, and of an aggrieved party's right to  obtain judicial review of the final decision pursuant to section 14(e)  of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of the reparation order. For purposes of computing the 30- day period for filing the appeal bond required by section 14(e) of the  Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e), ``the date of the reparation order'' shall be the  date that the Commission's opinion and order (or order of summary  affirmance, as the case may be) is filed with the Proceedings Clerk.  This date shall be reflected by the date stamp on the first page of the  Commission's order.  [49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 17692, May 18, 1988]</p>
