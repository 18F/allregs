                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claims over $50,000. Hands-on investigation will be conducted by  claims personnel as set forth in DA Pam 27-162, Chapter 2, Section IV,  regardless of the amount of insurance coverage immediately available,  with a view to discovery of other sources of recovery, for example,  vehicle defects or improper maintenance, road design and absence of  warning signs, products liability, medical malpractice in civilian  treatment facilities. Where the employment   of experts is indicated follow the procedures in Sec. 536.39 of this  chapter. No attorney representation agreement will be sent to the  injured party's representative without USARCS approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims of $50,000 or less. The amount of hands-on investigative  effort is directly related to the amount of insurance coverage that the  tortfeasor possesses and the amount of coverage that the injured party  has. Where the injured party is represented, request information from  his lawyer or insurer, in addition to the documents obtained in initial  screening. The ACO should be able to form an independent opinion as to  liability based on the investigation of the government and not solely on  that of the injured party's attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims of $5,000 or less. Small claims procedures are applicable  to the extent feasible. See Sec. 536.33 of this chapter. Investigation,  assertion and settlement by e-mail, phone or fax is encouraged. The  investigation and action should be recorded. DA Form 1668, Small Claims  Certificate, may be used as a model, modifying it as needed. A sample  completed Small Claims Certificate is posted at USARCS Web site for the  address see the Note to Sec. 537.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relations with injured party. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the injured party becomes  known and an interview can be conducted locally, all relevant facts will  be obtained unless the injured party is represented by a lawyer. In this  latter event, basic information as set forth on DD Form 2527, Statement  of Personal Injury (a completed sample is posted at the USARCS Web site;  for the address see the Note to Sec. 537.1) can be obtained without  violating lawyer-client privilege. If the injured party is not  immediately available, the information can be obtained by requesting  assistance from another ACO, a unit claims officer, a reservist or Army  National Guard (ANG) member, another federal agency, or another means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the injured party is represented, a Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) medical release form (sample  posted at the USARCS Web site; see Sec. 537 (b)(4)) permitting USARCS  to send out the medical records of the injured party for claims  purposes, will be sent to the injured party's lawyer for completion and  return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the injured party or his or her lawyer refuses to furnish  necessary information, it can usually be obtained by other means, for  example, from an accident report or investigation. A notice will be  furnished to all parties that the government has been assigned the right  to bring a claim for the value of medical care furnished, lost pay or  value of property lost or destroyed, and that the United States has the  right to bring an independent cause of action. In absence of timely and  appropriate response, discuss with the AAO to determine what action  should be taken.</p>
