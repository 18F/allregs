It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent, residues, etc. Examine all glassware including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of oil samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.</p><p class="depth0">apparatus</p><p class="depth0">Separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, 500-milliliter, 1,000-milliliter, and preferably 2,000-milliliter capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks.</p><p class="depth0">Evaporation flask (optional). 250-milliliter or 500-milliliter capacity all-glass flask equipped with standard-taper stopper having inlet and outlet tubes to permit passage of nitrogen across the surface of contained liquid to be evaporated.</p><p class="depth0">Spectrophotometric cells.

For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30-milliliter coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65-milliliter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15-milliliter portions of the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter path length between 280 m and 400 m when tested as prescribed under ``Organic solvents.'' Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5-centimeter path cell between 250 millimicrons and 400 millimicrons for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a metal sample. The absorbance per centimeter path length should not exceed 0.02 in the wavelength range from 280 m to 400 m.</p><p class="depth0">Place 300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.</p><p class="depth0">procedure</p><p class="depth0">Sample. Select metal foil or sheet stock for the test which has not been previously contaminated by careless handling or exposure to atmospheric dust and fumes. A commercial coil in the form supplied for spindle mounting in a packaging line or wrapping machine is most suitable. Strip off the outside turn of metal and discard. Carefully avoid contamination or damage from handling the metal (wear gloves). Remove a 16-18-foot length from the coil and place it on a flat surface protected by a length of new kraft paper. Cut four 15-foot strips from the sample, each 3 inches wide (avoid tearing the edges of the strips). Using a piece of suitable glass rod, roll the strips of metal into loose coils and insert each into a Soxhlet thimble. Each turn of coil should be visibly separated from the adjacent turn.</p><p class="depth0">Extraction. Fill each of the four Soxhlet tubes with purified isooctane (see under heading ``Reagents and Materials,'' above) until siphon action occurs and then refill the tube body. Supply heat to the boiling flask and allow extraction to continue for at least 8 hours or until repeated weighings of the dried and cooled coil show no further weight loss.</p><p class="depth0">Combine the isooctane extracts from the four Soxhlet units in a suitable beaker, rinsing each tube and flask into the beaker with fresh purified solvent. Evaporate the solvent under an atmosphere of inert gas (nitrogen) to residual volume of 50-60 milliliters and transfer this solution to a 500-milliliter separatory funnel containing 100 milliliters of pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture. Complete the transfer of the sample with small portions of pre-equilibrated isooctane to give a total volume of the residue and solvent of 75 milliliters. Shake the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels with each containing 30 milliliters of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After separation of liquid phases, carefully draw off lower layer into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel and wash in tandem with the 30-milliliter portion of isooctane contained in the 250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture and wash each extractive in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane.</p><p class="depth0">Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) containing 480 milliliters of distilled water; mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliter of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80 milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with isooctane (see sodium sulfate under ``Reagents and Materials'' for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once.</p><p class="depth0">Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in 5-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280m-400m (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a metal sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in this paragraph, the residue meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following substances may be used in surface lubricants used to facilitate the drawing, stamping, or forming of metallic articles from rolled foil or sheet stock by further processing provided that the total residual lubricant remaining on the metallic article in the form in which it contacts food does not exceed 0.2 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Antioxidants used in compliance with regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substances identified in this subparagraph.
