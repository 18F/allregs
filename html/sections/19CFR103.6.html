                                Sec. 103.6  Grant or denial of initial request.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Officers designated to make initial determinations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service  ports. The appropriate director of a service port, or in the case of  records of the Office of Investigations, the appropriate special agent  in charge (SAC), shall make any initial determination of a request for a  record which is maintained, respectively, at that service port or under  the SAC's jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Headquarters. For records located at Customs Service  Headquarters, the initial determination to grant or deny a request shall  be made by the appropriate Division Director at Customs Service  Headquarters having custody of or functional jurisdiction over the  subject matter of the requested records. In the event the request  relates to records which are maintained in an office which is not within  a division, the initial determination shall be made by the individual  designated for that purpose by the Assistant Commissioner having  responsibility for that office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limit for initial determinations. The time limit for making  an initial determination to grant or deny a request for records,  including the time for notifying the requester of that determination, is  10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after  the date of receipt of the request (see Sec. 103.5(f)), unless the  designated officer invokes an extension pursuant to Sec. 103.8(a) or  the requester otherwise agrees to an extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grant of request. If the appropriate Customs officer grants a  request, and if the requester wants a copy of the requested records,  that officer shall mail a copy of those records to the requester  together with a statement of the fees for search and duplication at the  time of the determination or promptly thereafter. If a requester wants  to inspect the record, the appropriate Customs officer who grants the  request   shall send written notice to the requester stating the time and place of  inspection and the amount of any fee involved in the request. In such a  case, the appropriate Customs officer shall make the record available  for inspection at the time and place stated, but in a manner so as not  to interfere with its use by the United States Customs Service or to  exclude other persons from making an inspection. In addition, reasonable  limitations may be placed on the number of records which may be  inspected by a person on any given date. The requester is not allowed to  remove a record from the inspection room. If, after making inspection,  the requester wants a copy of all or a portion of the requested record,  the appropriate Customs officer shall supply the desired copy upon  payment of the established fee prescribed in Sec. 103.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denial of request. The Customs officer who denies a request for  records (whether in whole or in part) shall mail written notice of the  denial to the requester. The letter of notificatimn shall contain (1)  the physical location of the requested records, (2) the applicable  exemption(s) and reason for not granting the request, (3) the name and  title or position of the Customs officer who denied the request, (4)  advice on the right to administrative appeal in accordance with Sec.  103.7, and (5) the title and address of the Customs officer who is to  decide any appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inability to locate records within time limits. If a requested  record cannot be located and evaluated within the initial 10-day period  or the extension period allowed under Sec. 103.8(a), the Customs  officer who is responsible for the initial determination shall continue  to search for the records. However, that officer shall also notify the  requester of the facts and inform the requester that he or she may  consider the notification to be a denial of access within the meaning of  paragraph (d) of this section, and provide the requester with the  address for the submission of an administrative appeal. The requester  may also be invited, in the alternative, to agree to a voluntary  extension of time in which to locate and evaluate the records. A  voluntary extension of time does not waive a requester's right to appeal  any ultimate denial of access or to appeal a failure to locate the  records within the voluntary extension period.
