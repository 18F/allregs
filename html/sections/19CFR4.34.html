                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prematurely landed cargo. Upon receipt of a satisfactory written application from the owner or agent of a vessel establishing that cargo was prematurely landed and left behind by the importing vessel through error or emergency, the port director may permit inward foreign cargo remaining on the dock to be reladen on the next available vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel for transportation to the destination

shown on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the first vessel, provided the importing vessel actually entered the port of destination of the prematurely landed cargo. Unless so forwarded within 30 days from the date of landing, the cargo shall be appropriately entered for Customs clearance or for forwarding in bond; otherwise, it shall be sent to general order as unclaimed. If the merchandise is so entered for Customs clearance at the port of unlading, or if it is so forwarded in bond, other than by the importing vessel or by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, representatives of the importing vessel shall file at the port of unlading a Cargo Declaration in duplicate listing the cargo. The port director shall retain the original and forward the duplicate to the director of the originally intended port of discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overcarried cargo. Upon receipt of a satisfactory written application by the owner or agent of a vessel establishing that cargo was not landed at its destination and was overcarried to another domestic port through error or emergency, the port director may permit the cargo to be returned in the importing vessel, or in another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, to the destination shown on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the importing vessel, provided the importing vessel actually entered the port of destination. \67\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\67\ See Sec. 141.69(c) of this chapter for the conditions under which such merchandise and goods removed from a port of intended entry under these or certain other circumstances may subsequently be cleared under a consumption entry which had been filed therefore before the merchandise was removed from the port of intended entry.</p><p class="depth2">68-69 [Reserved]---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inaccessibly stowed cargo. Cargo so stowed as to be inaccessible upon arrival at destination may be retained on board, carried forward to another domestic port or ports, and returned to the port of destination in the importing vessel or in another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel in the same manner as other overcarried cargo.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for forwarding cargo. When it is desired that prematurely landed cargo, overcarried cargo, or cargo so stowed as to be inaccessible, be forwarded to its destination by the importing vessel or by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel in accordance with paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the required application shall be filed with the local director of the port of premature landing or overcarriage by the owner or agent of the vessel. The application shall be supported by a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, in such number of copies as the port director may require. Whenever practicable, the application shall be made on the face of the Cargo Declaration below the description of the merchandise. The application shall specify the vessel on which the cargo was imported, even though the forwarding to destination is by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, and all ports of departure and dates of sailing of the importing vessel. The application shall be stamped and signed to show that it has been approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Manifesting prematurely landed or overcarried cargo. One copy of the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, shall be certified by Customs for use as a substitute traveling manifest for the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo being forwarded as residue cargo, whether or not the forwarding vessel is also carrying other residue cargo. If the application for forwarding is made on the Cargo Declaration, the new substitute traveling manifest shall be stamped to show the approval of the application. If the application is on a separate document, a copy thereof, stamped to show its approval, shall be attached to the substitute traveling manifest. An appropriate cross-reference shall be placed on the original traveling manifest to show that the vessel has one or more substitute traveling manifests. A permit to proceed endorsed on a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, issued to the vessel transporting the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo to its destination shall make reference to the nature of such cargo, identifying it with the importing vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Residue cargo procedure. A vessel with prematurely landed or overcarried cargo on board shall comply upon arrival at all domestic ports of call with all the requirements of part 4 relating to foreign residue cargo for domestic ports. The substitute traveling manifest, carried forward from port to port by the oncarrying vessel, shall be finally surrendered at the port where the last portion of the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo is discharged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cargo undelivered at foreign port and returned to the U.S. Merchandise shipped from a domestic port, but undelivered at the foreign destination and returned, shall be manifested as ``Undelivered-to be returned to original foreign destination,'' if such a return is intended. The port director may issue a permit to retain the merchandise on board, or he may, upon written application of the steamship company, issue a permit on a Delivery Ticket, Customs Form 6043, allowing the merchandise to be transferred to another vessel for return to the original foreign destination. No charge shall be made against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions relating to international carriers set forth in Sec. 113.64 of this chapter. The items shall be remanifested outward and an explanatory reference of the attending circumstances and compliance with export requirements noted.
