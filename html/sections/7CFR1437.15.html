Interest will be paid on the net amount ultimately found to be due, and will begin accruing on the 31st day after the date the producer signs, dates, and submits a properly completed application for payment on the designated form, or the 31st day after a disputed application is adjudicated. Interest will be paid unless the reason for failure to timely pay is due to the producer's failure to provide information or other material necessary for the computation of payment, or there was a genuine dispute concerning eligibility for payment.
