Section 511 of the Act provides, under conditions specified, for the nonrecognition, for income and excess-profits tax purposes, of the gain realized from the sale or indemnification for loss of certain vessels including certain vessels in the course of construction, or shares therein. It also permits the accumulation of the proceeds of such sales or indemnification and of certain earnings without liability under Part I (section 531 and following), Subchapter G, Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the regulations thereunder (Sec. Sec. 1.531-1 through 1.537-3 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability of benefits.

A citizen operating such a vessel or vessels owned by any other person or

persons can derive no benefit from the provisions relating to the nonrecognition of gain from the sale or loss of such vessel or vessels so owned, but may establish a construction reserve fund in which he may deposit earnings from the operation of such vessel or vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability of section 511.

A loss to be within section 511 of the Act must be an actual or constructive total loss. Whether there is a total loss, actual or constructive, will be determined by the Administration.</p>
