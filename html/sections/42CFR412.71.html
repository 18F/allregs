                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Base-year costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each hospital, the intermediary will  estimate the hospital's Medicare Part A allowable inpatient operating  costs, as described in Sec. 412.2(c), for the 12-month or longer cost  reporting period ending on or after September 30, 1982 and before  September 30, 1983.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the hospital's last cost reporting period ending before  September 30, 1983 is for less than 12 months, the base period will be  the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period  ending before such short reporting period, with an appropriate  adjustment for inflation. (The rules applicable to new hospitals are set  forth in Sec. 412.74.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modifications to base-year costs. Prior to determining the  hospital-specific rate, the intermediary will adjust the hospital's  estimated base-year inpatient operating costs, as necessary, to include  malpractice insurance costs in accordance with Sec. 413.53(a)(1)(i) of  this chapter, and exclude the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medical education costs as described in Sec. 413.85 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capital-related costs as described in Sec. 413.130 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Kidney acquisition costs incurred by hospitals approved as renal  transplantation centers as described in Sec. 412.100. Kidney  acquisition costs in the base year will be determined by multiplying the  hospital's average kidney acquisition cost per kidney times the number  of kidney transplants covered by Medicare Part A during the base period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Higher costs that were incurred for purposes of increasing base- year costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> One-time nonrecurring higher costs or revenue offsets that have  the effect of distorting base-year costs as an appropriate basis for  computing the hospital-specific rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Higher costs that result from changes in hospital accounting  principles initiated in the base year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetists' services, as  described in Sec. 412.113(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hospital's request for adjustment of base-year inpatient  operating costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the date it becomes subject to the  prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, a hospital may  request the intermediary to further adjust its estimated base-period  costs to take into account the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Services paid for under Medicare Part B during the hospital's  base year that will be paid for under prospective payments. The base- year costs may be increased to include estimated payments for certain  services previously billed as physicians' services before the effective  date of Sec. 415.102(a) of this chapter, and estimated payments for  nonphysicians' services that were not furnished either directly or under  arrangements before October 1, 1983 (the effective date of Sec.  405.310(m) of this chapter), but may not include the costs of  anesthetists' services for which a physician employer continues to bill  under Sec. 405.553(b)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The payment of FICA taxes during cost reporting periods subject  to the prospective payment system, if the hospital had not paid such  taxes for all its employees during its base period   and will be required to participate effective January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a hospital requests that its base-period costs be adjusted  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must timely provide the  intermediary with sufficient documentation to justify the adjustment,  and adequate data to compute the adjusted costs. The intermediary  decides whether to use part or all of the data on the basis of audit,  survey and other information available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Intermediary's determination. The intermediary uses the best  data available at the time in estimating each hospital's base-year costs  and the modifications to those costs authorized by paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section. The intermediary's estimate of base-year costs and  modifications thereto is final and may not be changed after the first  day of the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1,  1983, except as provided in Sec. 412.72.
