                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance of audits. When State procedures call for audits of contracts or subcontracts for engineering design services, the audit shall be performed to test compliance with the requirements of the cost principles contained in 48 CFR part 31. Other procedures may be used if permitted by State statutes that were enacted into law prior to June 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Audits for indirect cost rate. Contracting agencies shall use the indirect cost rate established by a cognizant agency audit for the cost principles contained in 48 CFR part 31 for the consultant, if such rates are not under dispute. A lower indirect cost rate may be used if submitted by the consultant firm, however the consultant's offer of a lower indirect cost rate shall not be a condition of contract award. The contracting agencies shall apply these indirect cost rates for the purposes of contract estimation, negotiation, administration, reporting, and contract payment and the indirect cost rates shall not be limited by any administrative or de facto ceilings. The consultant's indirect cost rates for its one-year applicable accounting period shall be applied to the contract, however once an indirect cost rate is established for a contract it may be extended beyond the one year applicable accounting period provided all concerned parties agree. Agreement to the extension of the one-year applicable period shall not be a condition of contract award. Other procedures may be used if permitted by State statutes that were enacted into law prior to June 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disputed audits. If the indirect cost rate(s) as established by the cognizant audit in paragraph (b) of this section are in dispute, the parties of any proposed new contract must negotiate a provisional indirect cost rate or perform an independent audit to establish a rate for the specific contract. Only the consultant and the parties involved in performing the indirect cost audit may dispute the established indirect cost rate. If an error is discovered in the established indirect cost rate, the rate may be disputed by any prospective user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prenotification; confidentiality of data. The FHWA and recipients and subrecipients of Federal-aid highway funds may share the audit information in complying with the State or subrecpient's acceptance of a consultant's overhead rates pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 112 and this part provided that the consultant is given notice of each use and transfer. Audit information shall not be provided to other consultants or any other government agency not sharing the cost data, or to any firm or government agency for purposes other than complying with the State or subrecpient's acceptance of a consultant's overhead rates pursuant

to 23 U.S.C. 112 and this part without the written permission of the affected consultants. If prohibited by law, such cost and rate data shall not be disclosed under any circumstance, however should a release be required by law or court order, such release shall make note of the confidential nature of the data.</p>
