                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Procedures for protests to GAO are found at 4 CFR Part 21 (GAO Bid  Protest Regulations). In the event guidance concerning GAO procedure in  this section conflicts with 4 CFR part 21, 4 CFR part 21 governs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A protester is required to furnish a  copy of its complete protest to the official and location designated in  the solicitation or, in the absence of such a designation, to the  contracting officer, so it is received no later than 1 day after the  protest is filed with the GAO. The GAO may dismiss the protest if the  protester fails to furnish a complete copy of the protest within 1 day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediately after receipt of the GAO's written notice that a  protest has been filed, the agency shall give notice of the protest to  the contractor if the award has been made, or, if no award has been  made, to all parties who appear to have a reasonable prospect of  receiving award if the protest is denied. The agency shall furnish  copies of the protest submissions to such parties with instructions to  (i) communicate directly with the GAO, and (ii) provide copies of any  such communication to the agency and to other participating parties when  they become known. However, if the protester has identified sensitive  information and requests a protective order, then the contracting  officer shall obtain a redacted version from the protester to furnish to  other interested parties, if one has not already been provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon notice that a protest has been filed with the GAO, the  contracting officer shall immediately begin compiling the information  necessary for a report to the GAO. The agency shall submit a complete  report to the GAO within 30 days after the GAO notifies the agency by  telephone that a protest has been filed, or within 20 days after receipt  from the GAO of a determination to use the express option, unless the  GAO--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Advises the agency that the protest has been dismissed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Authorizes a longer period in response to an agency's request  for an extension. Any new date is documented in the agency's file.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a protest is filed with the GAO, and an actual or  prospective offeror so requests, the procuring agency shall, in  accordance with any applicable protective orders, provide actual or  prospective offerors reasonable access to the protest file. However, if  the GAO dismisses the protest before the documents are submitted to the  GAO, then no protest file need be made available. Information exempt  from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 may be redacted from the protest  file. The protest file shall be made available to non-intervening actual  or prospective offerors within a reasonable time after submittal of an  agency report to the GAO. The protest file shall include an index and as  appropriate--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The protest;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The offer submitted by the protester;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The offer being considered for award or being protested;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> All relevant evaluation documents;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The solicitation, including the specifications or portions  relevant to the protest;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The abstract of offers or relevant portions; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Any other documents that the agency determines are relevant to  the protest, including documents specifically requested by the  protester.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 5 days prior to the filing of the report, in cases in  which the protester has filed a request for specific documents, the  agency shall provide to all parties and the GAO a list of those  documents, or portions of documents, that the agency has released to the  protester or intends to produce in its report, and those documents that  the agency intends to withhold from the protester and the reasons for  the proposed withholding. Any objection to the scope of the agency's  proposed disclosure or nondisclosure of the documents must be filed with  the GAO and the other parties within 2 days after receipt of this list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The agency report to the GAO shall include--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A copy of the documents described in 33.104(a)(3)(ii);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The contracting officer's signed statement of relevant facts,  including a best estimate of the contract value, and a memorandum of  law. The contracting officer's statement shall set forth findings,  actions, and recommendations, and any additional evidence or information  not provided in the protest file that may be necessary to determine the  merits of the protest; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A list of parties being provided the documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the same time the agency submits its report to the GAO,  the agency shall furnish copies of its report to the protester and any  intervenors. A party shall receive all relevant documents, except--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Those that the agency has decided to withhold from that party  for any reason, including those covered by a protective order issued by  the GAO. Documents covered by a protective order shall be released only  in accordance with the terms of the order. Examples of documents the  agency may decide to exclude from a copy of the report include documents  previously furnished to or prepared by a party; classified information;  and information that would give the party a competitive advantage; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Protester's documents which the agency determines, pursuant to  law or regulation, to withhold from any interested party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the protester requests additional documents within 2 days  after the protester knew the existence or relevance of additional  documents, or should have known, the agency shall provide the requested  documents to the GAO within 2 days of receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The additional documents shall also be provided to the protester  and other interested parties within this 2-day period unless the agency  has decided to withhold them for any reason (see subdivision (a)(4)(i)  of this section). This includes any documents covered by a protective  order issued by the GAO. Documents covered by a protective order shall  be provided only in accordance with the terms of the order.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The agency shall notify the GAO of any documents withheld from  the protester and other interested parties and shall state the reasons  for withholding them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The GAO may issue protective orders which establish terms,  conditions, and restrictions for the provision of any document to an  interested party. Protective orders prohibit or restrict the disclosure  by the party of procurement sensitive information, trade secrets or  other proprietary or confidential research, development or commercial  information that is contained in such document. Protective orders do not  authorize withholding any documents or information from the United  States Congress or an executive agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requests for protective orders. Any party seeking issuance of a  protective order shall file its request with the GAO as soon as  practicable after the protest is filed, with copies furnished  simultaneously to all parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusions and rebuttals. Within 2 days after receipt of a copy  of the protective order request, any party may file with the GAO a  request that particular documents be excluded from the coverage of the  protective order, or that particular parties or individuals be included  in or excluded from the protective order. Copies of the request shall be  furnished simultaneously to all parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Additional documents. If the existence or relevance of  additional documents first becomes evident after a protective order has  been issued, any party may request that these additional documents be  covered by the protective order. Any party to the protective order also  may request that individuals not already covered by the protective order  be included in the order. Requests shall be filed with the GAO, with  copies furnished simultaneously to all parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sanctions and remedies. The GAO may impose appropriate  sanctions for any violation of the terms of the protective order.  Improper disclosure of protected information will entitle the aggrieved  party to all appropriate remedies under law or equity. The GAO may also  take appropriate action against an agency which fails to provide  documents designated in a protective order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The protester and other interested parties are required to  furnish a copy of any comments on the agency report directly to the GAO  within 10 days, or 5 days if express option is used, after receipt of  the report, with copies provided to the contracting officer and to other  participating interested parties. If a hearing is held, these comments  are due within 5 days after the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Agencies shall furnish the GAO with the name, title, and  telephone number of one or more officials (in both field and  headquarters offices, if desired) whom the GAO may contact who are  knowledgeable about the subject matter of the protest. Each agency shall  be responsible for promptly advising the GAO of any change in the  designated officials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protests before award. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the agency has received notice  from the GAO of a protest filed directly with the GAO, a contract may  not be awarded unless authorized, in accordance with agency procedures,  by the head of the contracting activity, on a nondelegable basis, upon a  written finding that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect  the interest of the United States will not permit awaiting the decision  of the GAO; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Award is likely to occur within 30 days of the written finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contract award shall not be authorized until the agency has  notified the GAO of the finding in subparagraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a protest against the making of an award is received and  award will be withheld pending disposition of the protest, the  contracting officer should inform the offerors whose offers might become  eligible for award of the protest. If appropriate, those offerors should  be requested, before expiration of the time for acceptance of their  offer, to extend the time for acceptance to avoid the need for  resolicitation. In the event of failure to obtain such extensions of  offers, consideration should be given to proceeding under subparagraph  (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protests after award. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the agency receives notice of a  protest from the GAO within 10 days after contract award or within 5  days after a debriefing date offered to the protester for any debriefing  that is required by 15.505 or 15.506, whichever is later, the  contracting officer shall immediately   suspend performance or terminate the awarded contract, except as  provided in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with agency procedures, the head of the  contracting activity may, on a nondelegable basis, authorize contract  performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contract performance will be in the best interests of the United  States; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect  the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for the GAO's  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contract performance shall not be authorized until the agency  has notified the GAO of the finding in subparagraph (c)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When it is decided to suspend performance or terminate the  awarded contract, the contracting officer should attempt to negotiate a  mutual agreement on a no-cost basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the agency receives notice of a protest filed with the GAO  after the dates contained in subparagraph (c)(1), the contracting  officer need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded  contract unless the contracting officer believes that an award may be  invalidated and a delay in receiving the supplies or services is not  prejudicial to the Government's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Findings and notice. If the decision is to proceed with contract  award, or continue contract performance under paragraphs (b) or (c) of  this section, the contracting officer shall include the written findings  or other required documentation in the file. The contracting officer  also shall give written notice of the decision to the protester and  other interested parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hearings. The GAO may hold a hearing at the request of the  agency, a protester, or other interested party who has responded to the  notice in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A recording or transcription  of the hearing will normally be made, and copies may be obtained from  the GAO. All parties may file comments on the hearing and the agency  report within 5 days of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> GAO decision time. GAO issues its recommendation on a protest  within 100 days from the date of filing of the protest with the GAO, or  within 65 days under the express option. The GAO attempts to issue its  recommendation on an amended protest that adds a new ground of protest  within the time limit of the initial protest. If an amended protest  cannot be resolved within the initial time limit, the GAO may resolve  the amended protest through an express option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice to GAO. If the agency has not fully implemented the GAO  recommendations with respect to a solicitation for a contract or an  award or a proposed award of a contract within 60 days of receiving the  GAO recommendations, the head of the contracting activity responsible  for that contract shall report the failure to the GAO not later than 5  days after the expiration of the 60-day period. The report shall explain  the reasons why the GAO's recommendation, exclusive of costs, has not  been followed by the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Award of costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the GAO determines that a solicitation  for a contract, a proposed award, or an award of a contract does not  comply with a statute or regulation, the GAO may recommend that the  agency pay to an appropriate protester the cost, exclusive of profit, of  filing and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorney,  consultant, and expert witness fees, and bid and proposal preparation  costs. The agency shall use funds available for the procurement to pay  the costs awarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The protester shall file its claim for costs with the  contracting agency within 60 days after receipt of the GAO's  recommendation that the agency pay the protester its costs. Failure to  file the claim within that time may result in forfeiture of the  protester's right to recover its costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency shall attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of  costs to be paid. If the agency and the protester are unable to agree on  the amount to be paid, the GAO may, upon request of the protester,  recommend to the agency the amount of costs that the agency should pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 60 days after the GAO recommends the amount of costs the  agency should pay the protester, the agency shall notify the GAO of the  action taken by the agency in response to the recommendation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No agency shall pay a party, other than a small business concern  within the meaning of section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (see 2.101,  ``Small business concern''), costs under paragraph (h)(2) of this  section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For consultant and expert witness fees that exceed the highest  rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the Government  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3109 and 5 CFR 304.105; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For attorney's fees that exceed $150 per hour, unless the  agency determines, based on the recommendation of the Comptroller  General on a case-by-case basis, that an increase in the cost of living  or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified  attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee. The cap  placed on attorneys' fees for businesses, other than small businesses,  constitutes a benchmark as to a ``reasonable'' level for attorney's fees  for small businesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Before paying a recommended award of costs, agency personnel  should consult legal counsel. Section 33.104(h) applies to all  recommended awards of costs that have not yet been paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any costs the contractor receives under this section shall not  be the subject of subsequent proposals, billings, or claims against the  Government, and those exclusions should be reflected in the cost  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the Government pays costs, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of  this section, where a postaward protest is sustained as the result of an  awardee's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or  miscertification, the Government may require the awardee to reimburse  the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy  available, and pursuant to the requirements of subpart 32.6, the  Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any  payment due the awardee under any contract between the awardee and the  Government.
