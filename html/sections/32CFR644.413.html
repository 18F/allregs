                                Sec. 644.413  Exchanges of fee-owned land and easement interests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The statutes identified in Sec. Sec. 644.414 through 644.417  authorize the exchange of Government-owned lands and interests therein  for private lands and lands owned by States, other non-Federal agencies,  and their instrumentalities. As a general rule, any exchange of lands  should be restricted to lands of approximately equal value. Where the  Government property proposed for exchange has a value substantially in  excess of the private land to be acquired, the question of whether the  transaction is truly an exchange arises. In drafting relocation  contracts, care must be exercised to insure that there is legal  authority for execution of the conveyance or easement proposed.</p>
