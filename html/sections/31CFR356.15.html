                                Sec. 356.15  What rules apply to bids submitted by investment advisers?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The auction rules that apply to investment advisers are  determined by the relationship between ``investment advisers'' and  ``controlled accounts.'' An investment adviser means any person or  entity that has investment discretion for the bids or positions of a  different person or entity (a controlled account). A person or entity  has investment discretion if it determines what, how many, and when  securities will be purchased or sold on behalf of another person or  entity. We consider a person that is employed or supervised by an  investment adviser to be part of that investment adviser. We also  consider the bids or positions of controlled accounts to be separate  from the bids or positions of the person or entity with which they would  otherwise be associated under the bidder categories in appendix A of  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bidding options. (1) An investment adviser has two options for  whose name to use when bidding on behalf of controlled accounts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">An investment adviser may bid for a     In such cases, we consider the</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> in the investment adviser's own      the investment adviser.</p><p class="depth0">name. (ii) in the name of the controlled       the controlled account.</p><p class="depth0">account. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Using the first option (paragraph (b)(1)(i)), an investment  advisor could bid noncompetitively up to the noncompetitive bidding  limit only for itself, as a single bidder. Using the second option  (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), an investment adviser could bid noncompetitively  for each separately named controlled account up to the noncompetitive  bidding limit. The investment adviser could also bid noncompetitively in  its own name in the same auction up to the noncompetitive bidding limit.  An investment adviser may not bid for a controlled account both  noncompetitively and competitively in the same auction. If an investment  adviser is bidding competitively in the name of a controlled account,  the controlled account is subject to the award limitations of Sec.  356.22(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting net long positions. If it is bidding competitively, an  investment adviser must calculate the amount of its bids and positions  for purposes of the net long position reporting requirement found in  Sec. 356.13(a). In addition to its own competitive bids and positions,  the investment adviser must also include in the calculation all other  competitive bids and positions that it controls. If the net long  position is reportable, the investment adviser must report it as a total  in connection with only one bid as stated in Sec. 356.13(a). This  requirement applies regardless of whether the investment adviser bids in  its own name or in the name of its controlled accounts. The following  table shows which positions an investment adviser must include to  determine whether it meets the net long position reporting threshold in  Sec. 356.13(a). If an investment adviser does meet the reporting  threshold, the table also shows which positions must be included in, and  which may be excluded from, the net long position calculation.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">If an investment adviser is bidding</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the investment adviser has a net     that position must be included</p><p class="depth0">long position for its own account.       in the investment adviser's</p><p class="depth0">net long position calculation. (2) the investment adviser's             any net long position of that</p><p class="depth0">competitive bid is for a controlled      account must be included in</p><p class="depth0">account.                                 the investment adviser's net</p><p class="depth0">long position calculation. (3) the investment adviser is not</p><p class="depth0">bidding competitively for a controlled</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the controlled account has a net     that position must be included</p><p class="depth0">long position of $100 million or more.   in the investment adviser's</p><p class="depth0">net long position calculation. (ii) the controlled account has a net    that position may be excluded</p><p class="depth0">long position that is less than $100     from the investment adviser's</p><p class="depth0">million.                                 net long position calculation. (iii) any net long position is excluded  all net short positions of</p><p class="depth0">under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this       controlled accounts under $100</p><p class="depth0">table.                                   million must also be excluded. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certifications. When an investment adviser bids for a controlled  account, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that it is  complying with this part and the auction announcement for the security.  Further, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that the  information it provided about bids for controlled accounts is accurate  and complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Proration of awards. Investment advisers that submit competitive  bids in the names of controlled accounts are responsible for prorating  any awards at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount  margin using the same percentage that we announce.See Sec. 356.21 for  examples of how to prorate.
