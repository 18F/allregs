A recipient that offers  physical education courses or that operates or sponsors intercollegiate,  club, or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped  students an equal opportunity for participation in these activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education  and athletic activities that are separate or different only if  separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of  Sec. 104.43(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied  the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that  are not separate or different.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Counseling and placement services. A recipient to which this  subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational  counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall  provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap.  The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not  counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are  nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This  requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual  information about licensing and certification requirements that may  present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular  careers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Social organizations. A recipient that provides significant  assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall  assure itself that the membership practices of such organizations do not  permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.
