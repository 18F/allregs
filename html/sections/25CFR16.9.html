                            <p class="depth0">Where information, furnished by the Bureau pursuant to Sec. 16.4 or otherwise obtained, reveals that the estate of a deceased Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes, who has been dead 5 or more years after having died intestate without heirs, consists of restricted interests in lands or rents or profits therefrom, the Field Solicitor shall, in the absence of any final decree determining that the decedent died without heirs or devisees, prepare and furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of escheat, based on affidavit or other proof

of intestate death without heirs, setting forth the restricted interests in lands or rents or profits therefrom which have by escheat vested in the tribe which allotted the lands. The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or devisee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the order. After final action on any order has been taken by the Field Solicitor, the Bureau shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed in the land records of each county within which are located any escheated lands described therein and shall cause the tribe to be credited with any funds in said estate which arose from rents or profits from such lands, unless a timely appeal therefrom has been filed in accordance with part 2 of this title.</p>
