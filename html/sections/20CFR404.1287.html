                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extension by agreement. The applicable time period described  in Sec. 404.1286 for assessment of an amount due may, before the  expiration of such period, be extended for no more than 6 months by  written agreement between the State and the Commissioner. The agreement  must involve and identify a known issue or reporting error. It must also  identify the periods involved, the time limitation which is being  extended and the date to which it is being extended, and the coverage  group(s) and position(s) or individual(s) to which the agreement  applies. The extension of the period of limitation shall not become  effective until the agreement is signed by the appropriate State  official and the Commissioner. (See Sec. 404.3(c) for the applicable  rule where periods of limitation expire on nonwork days.) An assessment  made by the Commissioner before the extended time limit ends shall be  considered to have been made within the time period limitation specified  in section 218(q)(2) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of  Pub. L. 99-509. (See Sec. 404.1286.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reextension. An extension agreement provided for in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section may be reextended by written agreement between  the State and the Commissioner for no more than 6 months at a time  beyond the expiration of the prior extension or reextension agreement,  and only if one of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Litigation (including intrastate litigation) or a review under  Sec. 404.1290 or Sec. 404.1297 involving wage reports or corrections on  the same issue is pending; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State is actively pursuing corrections of a known error  which require additional time to complete; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Social Security Administration is developing a coverage or  wage issue which was being considered before the statute of limitations  expired and additional time is needed to make a determination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Social Security Administration has not issued to the State  a final audit statement on the State's wage or correction reports; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> There is pending Federal legislation which may substantially  affect the issue in question, or the issue has national implications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The 365-day period. If a State files a report before the  applicable time limitation in Sec. 404.1286 (or any extension under  paragraph (a) of this section) ends and makes no payment or pays less  than the correct amount due, the Commissioner may assess the State for  the amount due after the applicable time limitation has ended. However,  the Commissioner must make the assessment no later than the 365th day  after the day the State makes payment   to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commissioner can only make this  assessment on the wages paid to the reported individuals for the  reported periods. The Commissioner, in making this assessment, credits  the amount paid by the State on these individuals' wages for those  reported periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1) and (2) describe the time limits for revising an earnings  record where an individual has applied for monthly benefits or a lump- sum death payment or requested that we correct his earnings record.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overpayment of contributions on wages of employee having other  wages in a period barred to assessment. If the Commissioner allows a  State a credit or refund of an overpayment for wages paid or alleged to  have been paid an individual in a calendar year but the facts upon which  the allowance is based establish that contributions are due on other  wages paid that individual in that year which are barred to assessment,  we may make an assessment notwithstanding the periods of limitation in  Sec. 404.1286. The assessment, however, must be made before or at the  time we notify the State of the allowance of the credit or refund. In  this situation, the Commissioner reduces the amount of the State's  credit or refund by the assessed amount and notifies the State  accordingly. For purposes of this paragraph, the assessment shall only  include contributions and not interest as provided for in section 218(j)  of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 99-509.</p><p class="depth2">Example: The State files an adjustment report timely to correct an  error in the amount reported as wages for an employee. The correction  reduces the employee's wages for the year to less than the maximum  amount creditable. The employee has other earnings in the same year  which were not reported because of the previously reported maximum  amounts. The applicable time limitation for assessing contributions on  wages for the year has expired before the credit was allowed. The  Commissioner may assess for the underpaid contributions but no later  than thd date of the notice to the State that its claim for a credit had  been allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evasion of payment. The Commissioner may make an assessment of  an amount due at any time where the State's failure to pay the amount  due results from the fraudulent attempt of an officer or employee of the  State or political subdivision to defeat or evade payment of that  amount.  [53 FR 32976, Aug. 29, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 38451, July 18, 1997]</p>
