                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest subject to reporting requirement. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.6049-4, 1.6049-6 and this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``interest'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest on an obligation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In registered form (as defined in Sec. 5f.103-1(c)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Of a type offered to the public. Principles consistent with Sec. 5f.163-1 shall be applied to determine whether an obligation is of a type offered to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business. Such term shall include deposits evidenced by time certificates of deposit issued in any amount whether negotiable or non-

negotiable. The term ``interest'' includes payments to a mortgage escrow account and amounts paid with respect to repurchase agreements and banker's acceptances. Property which the payee receives from the payor as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of interest) shall be interest for purposes of section 6049. The amount subject to reporting is the fair market value of such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts, whether or not designated as interest, paid or credited by mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead associations, credit unions, industrial loan associations or banks, or similar organizations, in respect of deposits, face amount certificates, investment certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Thus, even though amounts paid or credited by such organizations with respect to deposits are designated as ``dividends'', such amounts are included in the definition of interest for purposes of section 6049. The term ``interest'' includes payments to a mortgage escrow account and amounts paid with respect to repurchase agreements. Property which the payee receives from the payor as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of interest) is ``interest'' for purposes of section 6049. The fair market value of such property is the amount subject ot reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest on amounts held by insurance companies under an agreement to pay interest thereon. Any increment in value of ``advance premiums'', ``prepaid premiums'', or ``premium deposit funds'' which is applied to the payment of premiums due on insurance policies, or made available for withdrawal by the policyholder, shall be considered interest subject to reporting. Interest that an insurance company pays pursuant to an agreement with the policyholder to a beneficiary because he payment due has been delayed is interest subject to reporting. Interest subject to reporting also includes interest paid by insurance companies with respect to policy ``dividend'' accumulations (see sections 61 and 451 and the regulations thereunder for rules as to when such interest is considered paid), and interest paid with respect to the proceeds of insurance policies left with the insurer. The so-called ``interest element'' in the case of annuity or installment payments under life insurance or endowment contracts does not constitute interest for purposes of section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interest on deposits with brokers as defined in section 6045(c) and the regulations thereunder. Any payment made in lieu of interest to a person whose obligation has been borrowed in connection with a short sale or other similar transaction is subject to reporting under section 6049. See Sec. 1.6045-2T for reporting requirements with respect to payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest. See Sec. 1.6045-2 for reporting requirements with respect to payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Interest paid on amounts held by investment companies as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. section 80-a) and on amounts paid on pooled funds or trusts. The interest to be reported with respect to a widely held fixed investment trust, as defined in Sec. 1.671-5(b)(22), shall be the interest earned on the assets held by the trust. See Sec. 1.671-5 for the reporting rules for widely held fixed investment trusts (as defined under that section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest excluded from reporting requirement. The term interest or original issue discount (OID) does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest on any obligation issued by a natural person as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(2), irrespective of whether such interest is collected on behalf of the holder of the obligation by a middleman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest on any obligation if such interest is exempt from taxation under section 103(a), relating to certain governmental obligations, or interest which is exempt from taxation under any other provision of law without regard to the identity of the holder. The holder of a tax exempt obligation that is not in registered form must provide written certification to the payor (other than the issuer of the obligation) that the obligation is exempt from taxation. A statement that interest coupons are tax exempt on the envelope or shell commonly used by financial institutions to process such coupons, signed by the payee, will be

sufficient for this purpose if the envelope is properly completed (i.e., shows the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payee). A payor may rely on such written certification in treating such interest as tax exempt for purposes of section 6049. See Sec. 1.6049-4(d)(8) with respect to the requirement that the issuer of a taxable obligation shall make an information return if such issuer receives an envelope which improperly claims that the interest coupons contained therein are tax exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest on amounts held in escrow to guarantee performance on a contract or to provide security. However, interest on amounts held in escrow with a person described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest that a governmental unit pays with respect to tax refunds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interest on deposits for security, such as deposits posted with a public utility company. However, interest on deposits posted for security with a person described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> through (8) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(b)(6) through (8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any amount paid by an international organization described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) (or its paying, transfer, or other agent that is not also a payee's agent) with respect to an obligation of which the international organization is the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)(i)</em> through (11)(ii)(A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(b)(10)(i) through (b)(11)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (11)(ii)(A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(b)(10)(i) through (b)(11)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The obligation must have on its face, and on any detachable coupons, the following statement (or a similar statement having the same effect):</p><p class="depth0">By accepting this obligation, the holder represents and warrants that it is not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) and regulations under that section) and that it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) and the regulations under that section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the obligation is in registered form, it must be registered in the name of an exempt recipient described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(b)(12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Amounts for the period that the debt obligation with respect to which the interest arises represents an asset blocked as described in Sec. 1.1441-2(e)(3). Payment of such amounts, including interest that is past due and OID on obligations that mature on or before the date that the assets are no longer blocked, is deemed to occur in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.1441-2(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> and (15) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(b)(14) and (15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Amounts of interest as determined under the provisions of Sec. 1.446-3(g)(4) (dealing with interest in the case of a significant non-periodic payment with respect to a notional principal contract). Such amounts are governed by the provisions of section 6041. See Sec. 1.6041-1(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicable rules--(1) through (4) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(c)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> U.S. payor, U.S. middleman, non-U.S. payor, and non-U.S. middleman. The terms payor and middleman have the meanings ascribed to them under Sec. 1.6049-4(a). A non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman means a payor or middleman other than a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman. The term U.S. payor or U.S. middleman means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. (A) A person described in section 7701(a)(30) (including a foreign branch or office of such person);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A person described in section 7701(a)(30) (including a foreign branch or office of such person);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The government of the United States or the government of any State or political subdivision thereof (or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(2)) who, in the aggregate hold more than 50 percent of the income or capital interest in the partnership or if, at any time during its tax year, it is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross income of which,

from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the collection or payment (or such part of such period as the person has been in existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of trade or business within the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(c)(5)(i)(F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting by U.S. payors in U.S. possessions. U.S. payors are not required to report on Form 1099 income that is from sources within a possession of the United States and that is exempt from taxation under section 931, 932, or 933, each of which sections exempts certain income from sources within a possession of the United States paid to a bona fide resident of that possession. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii), a U.S. payor may treat the beneficial owner as a bona fide resident of the possession of the United States from which the income is sourced if, prior to payment of the income, the U.S. payor can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation that supports the claim of residence in the possession of the United States from which the income is sourced. This paragraph (c)(5)(ii) shall not apply if the U.S. payor has actual knowledge or reason to know that the documentation is unreliable or incorrect or that the income does not satisfy the requirements for exemption under section 931, 932, or 933. For the rules determining whether income is from sources within a possession of the United States, see section 937(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of status as U.S. or foreign payee and applicable presumptions in the absence of documentation--(1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Presumptions of U.S. or foreign status in the absence of documentation--(i) through (iii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments to foreign intermediaries or flow-through entities--(i) through (iii)(A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payee may be an intermediary. If a payment is made to a person described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) that has not provided an intermediary withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i) but the payor knows or has reason to know that the payee may be an intermediary, the payor must apply the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. A payor has reason to know that such a person may be an intermediary if that person has provided documentation as an intermediary for another account with the same payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Short-term deposits and repurchase transactions. The provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and not paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section shall apply to deposits with banks and other financial institutions that remain on deposit for a period of two weeks or less, to amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and repurchase transaction that is completed within a period of two weeks or less, or to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(7), (10) and (11) of this section (relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of whether amounts are considered paid outside the United States--(1) through (5) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Original issue discount treated as payment of interest. In determining whether an obligation is one which was issued at a discount and the amount of discount which is includible in income of the holder, a payor (other than the issuer of the obligation) may rely on the Internal Revenue Service's publication of publicly traded original issue discount obligations. In the case of an obligation as to which there is during any calendar year an amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of any holder (as determined under sections 1232 and 1232A and the regulations thereunder), the issuer of the obligation or a middleman (as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(4)) shall be treated as having paid to such holder during such calendar year an amount of interest equal to the amount of original issue discount so includible without regard to any reduction by reason of a purchase allowance under

sections 1232(a)(2)(C)(ii), 1232A (a)(6) or (b)(4) or a purchase at a premium under 1232A(c)(4)(A) or paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1232-3. Thus, the determination of the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of any holder with respect to any obligation shall be determined as if any holder of the obligation were the original holder. However, see Sec. 1.6049-9 for the reporting of premium for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014. In the case of (1) an obligation to which section 1232A does not apply (for example, a short-term government obligation as defined in section 1232(a)(3)) and (2) an obligation issued on or before December 31, 1982, in bearer form, the amount of original issue discount includible in gross income shall be treated as if paid in the calendar year in which the date of maturity occurs or in which the date of redemption occurs if redemption occurs before maturity. The amount subject to reporting on an obligation issued in bearer form with a maturity at the date of issue of more than 1 year (a long term obligation) is the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the calendar year of maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before maturity. The amount of original issue discount subject to reporting on a long term obligation shall not be reduced to reflect any purchase allowance. Discount on short term government obligations as defined in section 1232(a)(3), such as Treasury bills, and discount on other obligations with a maturity at the date of issue of not more than 1 year (a short term obligation), including commercial paper, when paid at maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before maturity, shall constitute a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049. In general, the amount subject to reporting on short term obligations is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the original issue price. The procedure set forth in section 3455(b)(2)(B) and Sec. 31.3455(b)-1(b)(3) for establishing the price at which a holder purchased an obligation subsequent to the date of original issue shall apply for purposes of section 6049. Original issue discount on an obligation (including an obligation with a maturity of not more than six months from the date of original issue) held by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation is interest described in paragraph (b)(1)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section and, therefore is not interest subject to reporting under section 6049 unless it is described in Sec. 1.6049-8(a) (relating to deposit interest paid on or after January 1, 2013, to certain nonresident alien individuals).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date--(1) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(6) through (15), (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to payments made after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b)(6) through (15), (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to payments made after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5T(g)(2).

However, see, also Sec. 1.1471-4(c) or an applicable IGA for additional documentation requirements that may apply to a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) for determining the status of its account holders for chapter 4 purposes.

Although interest paid on the obligation issued by FC is foreign source, the interest paid by DC to D is considered to be interest under paragraph (b)(6) of this section for purposes of information reporting under section 6049 because it is not paid and received outside the United States within the meaning of Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(16).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(i), for purposes of this section (and other sections of regulations under this chapter 61 to which this paragraph (d)(2) applies), the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(i) through (ix) and Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply (by applying the term payor instead of the term withholding agent) to determine the classification (e.g., individual, corporation, partnership, trust), status (i.e., a U.S. or a foreign person), and other relevant characteristics (e.g., beneficial owner or intermediary) of a payee if a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) irrespective of whether the payments are subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or are withholdable payments. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) (referencing presumption rules for payments with respect to offshore obligations) shall not apply to a payment of an amount not subject to withholding under chapter 3, unless it is an amount that is a withholdable payment made to a payee that is an entity. Thus, in the case of a withholdable payment made to an entity, the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) shall apply regardless of whether the payment is an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3. Additionally, in the case of an amount paid outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) or (vii)(B) of an amount not subject to withholding under chapter 3 and that is treated as made to a payee that is an individual, the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) shall not apply, and the payee shall be presumed a U.S. person only when the payee has any of the indicia of U.S. status that are described in Sec. 1.1441-7(b)(5) or (8). In a case in which a withholding agent makes a withholdable payment that cannot reliably be associated with documentation, see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(4) and (5) for determining the status of the payee for chapter 4 purposes when the payment is treated as made to a foreign entity (by applying the term payor instead of the term withholding agent). The rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) shall apply for purposes of determining when a payment can reliably be associated with documentation, by applying the term payor instead of the term withholding agent. For this purpose, the information, documentary evidence, statement, or other documentation described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section can be treated as documentation with which a payment can be associated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grace period in the case of indicia of a foreign payee. When the conditions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) are satisfied, the 30-day grace period provisions under section 3406(e) shall not apply and the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) shall apply instead. A payor that, at any time during the grace period described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), credits an account with payments described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2) (or credits an account with broker proceeds from securities described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2)), that are reportable under sections 6042, 6045, 6049, or 6050N may, instead of treating the account as owned by a U.S. person and applying backup withholding under section 3406, if applicable, choose to treat the account as owned by a foreign person (and apply the grace period described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv)) if, at the beginning of the grace period, the address that the payor has in its records for the account holder is in a foreign country, the payor has been furnished the information contained in a withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2), or the payor holds a withholding certificate that is no longer reliable other than because the validity period as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) has expired. In the case of a newly opened account, the grace period begins on the date that the payor first credits the account. In the case of an existing account for which the payor holds a Form W-8 or documentary evidence of foreign status, the payor may apply the provisions of the grace period described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv), beginning on the date that the payor first credits the account after the existing documentation held with regard to the account can no longer be relied upon (other than because the validity period

described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) has expired). A new account shall be treated as an existing account for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) if the account holder already holds an account at the branch location at which the new account is opened, or if the account is treated as a consolidated obligation as defined in Sec. 1.1471-(1)(b)(23) for purpose of chapter 4 to the extent the account does not receive any amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3. A new account shall also be treated as an existing account for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) if an account is held at another branch location if the institution maintains an account information system described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ix). The grace period terminates on the earlier of the close of the 90th day from the date on which the grace period begins or the date that valid documentation is provided. The grace period also terminates when the remaining balance in the account (due to withdrawals or otherwise) is equal to or less than 28 percent (or other statutory tax rate that is applicable to backup withholding) of the total amounts credited since the beginning of the grace period that would be subject to backup withholding if the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) did not apply. At the end of the grace period, the payor shall treat the amounts credited to the account, or paid with respect to an account, during the grace period as paid to a U.S. or foreign payee depending upon whether documentation has been furnished and the nature of any such documentation furnished upon which the payor may rely to treat the account as owned by a U.S. or foreign payee. If the documentation has not been received on or before the date of expiration of the grace period, the payor may also apply the presumptions described in this paragraph (d) to amounts credited to the account after the date on which the grace period expires (until such time as the payor can reliably associate the documentation with amounts credited). See Sec. 31.6413(a)-3(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter for treating backup withheld amounts under section 3406 as erroneously withheld when the documentation establishing foreign status is furnished prior to the end of the calendar year in which backup withholding occurs. If the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) apply, the provisions of Sec. 31.3406(d)-3 of this chapter shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), an account holder's reinvestment of gross proceeds of a sale into other instruments constitutes a withdrawal and a non-qualified electronic transmission of information on a withholding certificate is a transmission that is not in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv). See Sec. 1.1092(d)-1 for a definition of the term actively traded for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Joint owners. Amounts paid to accounts held jointly for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph (b) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in Sec. Sec. 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (b)(12) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. In the case of an amount that is a withholdable payment made to a joint account, however, see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(7) for when the payment is treated as made to a foreign payee that is a nonparticipating FFI (as defined in Sec. 1.1471-1(b)(82)). For purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), the grace period described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments to foreign intermediaries or flow-through entities--(i) Payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or withholdable payments. In the case of payments of amounts that the payor may treat as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(C) and (b)(3)(v)(A) and 1.1441-5(c) or (e) and that are subject to withholding under Sec. 1.1441-2(a), the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) and 1.1441-5(c)(1), (e)(2), and (3) shall apply (by applying the term payor instead of

the term withholding agent) to identify the payee. If a payment of an amount subject to withholding cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation from a payee in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii), the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) and 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply to determine the payee's status for purposes of this section (and other sections of regulations under this chapter to which this paragraph (d)(3) applies). In the case of an amount that is a withholdable payment, see Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3) for rules to identify the payee and see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(5) for the presumption rule that shall apply to amounts treated as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity (by applying the term payor instead of the term withholding agent). For example, where a withholdable payment is made to an intermediary under Sec. 1.1471-3 that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI under Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(5), the nonparticipating FFI shall be treated as the payee under Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3) and for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i), therefore, no information return shall be required under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or withholdable payments. In the case of payments of amounts that the payor may treat as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(C) and (b)(3)(v)(A) and 1.1441-5(c) or (e) and that are subject to withholding under Sec. 1.1441-2(a), the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) and 1.1441-5(c)(1), (e)(2), and (3) shall apply (by applying the term payor instead of

the term withholding agent) to identify the payee. If a payment of an amount subject to withholding cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation from a payee in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii), the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) and 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply to determine the payee's status for purposes of this section (and other sections of regulations under this chapter to which this paragraph (d)(3) applies). In the case of an amount that is a withholdable payment, see Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3) for rules to identify the payee and see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(5) for the presumption rule that shall apply to amounts treated as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity (by applying the term payor instead of the term withholding agent). For example, where a withholdable payment is made to an intermediary under Sec. 1.1471-3 that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI under Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(5), the nonparticipating FFI shall be treated as the payee under Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3) and for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i), therefore, no information return shall be required under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments of amounts not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments.

In the case of such actual knowledge, the payor shall treat the payment that it knows is allocable to such U.S. person as a payment to a U.S. payee who is not an exempt recipient and has actual knowledge of the amount allocable to such a person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for payments of certain short-term original issue discount--(A) General rule. A payment of U.S. source interest or original issue discount on the redemption of an obligation with a maturity from the date of issue of 183 days or less (short-term OID) described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e) that the payor may treat as paid to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(C), (b)(3)(v)(A), Sec. 1.1441-5(d) or (e) (by substituting the term payor for the term withholding agent), shall be treated as paid to an undocumented U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient under paragraph Sec. 1.6049-4(c) unless the payor has documentation from the payees of the payment and the payment is allocated to foreign payees, as a group, and to each U.S. non-exempt recipient payee. See Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(2). However, a payor may rely on a withholding statement provided by an intermediary described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) (or similar withholding statement for a flow-through entity) that identifies a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (as described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)) only if it identifies the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) under Sec. 1.1471-3(d)(4) (by substituting the term payor with the term withholding agent).

The rules of paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section are illustrated by the examples in this paragraph (d)(4). Unless otherwise specified in an example, the following facts apply: all FFIs, such as a nonqualified intermediary that is an FFI, are treated as participating FFIs; all payees have been identified with chapter 4 statuses that do not require withholding under chapter 4; and none of the payments are withholdable payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. USP pays interest from sources within the United States that is a withholdable payment to an account maintained in the

United States by X. The interest is not deposit interest described in sections 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d). USP does not have a Form W-9, or withholding certificate from X as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16). Moreover, USP cannot treat X as an exempt recipient, as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), without documentation and there is no indication that X is an individual, trust, or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The U.S. source interest is an amount subject to withholding as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee of the interest. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of Sec. 1.1441-5 apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The presumption of U.S. status applies even though the payment is a withholdable payment (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section and Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(2) cross referencing the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)). The U.S. source interest paid to X is reportable under section 6049 on Form 1099 and the interest is subject to backup withholding under section 3406 because X has not provided its TIN on a valid Form W-9. No withholding or reporting applies to the payment under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the interest paid by USP is from sources outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Interest from sources outside the United States is not an amount subject to withholding, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a) or a withholdable payment. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of Sec. 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. These rules apply irrespective of whether the payment is an amount subject to withholding. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The foreign source interest is a payment subject to reporting on Form 1099 under Sec. 1.6049-5(a). Further, because X is a non-exempt recipient that has failed to provide its TIN on a valid Form W-9, the foreign source interest is subject to backup withholding under section 3406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. USP makes a payment of U.S. source interest outside the United States to an offshore account of X.

USP does not have a withholding certificate from X as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16) nor does it have documentary evidence as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii)(A)(2) and Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The interest is an amount subject to withholding as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) and Sec. 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of Sec. 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a foreign partnership. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(1)(i)(E), the payees of the interest are presumed to be the partners of X. Under Sec. 1.1441-5(d)(3), the partners are presumed to be undocumented foreign persons.

Therefore, USP must withhold 30% of the interest payment under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(1) and report the payment on Form 1042-S in accordance with Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section that is not an FFI. USP makes a payment outside the United States of interest from sources outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation held by X. USP does not have a withholding certificate from X as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16) nor does it have documentary evidence as described in Sec. Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) and 1.6049-5(c)(1). USP does not have actual knowledge of an employer identification number for X. X does not appear to be an individual, trust, or estate and cannot be treated as an exempt recipient, as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) in the absence of documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The interest is not an amount subject to withholding as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a) and is not a withholdable payment. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee of the interest. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of Sec. 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) applies to determine X's classification as an individual, trust, estate, corporation or partnership. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is treated as a partnership, since it does not appear to be an individual, trust, or estate and cannot be treated as an exempt recipient without documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) also states that the presumptions of foreign status for payments made with respect to offshore obligations contained in Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2) do not apply to amounts that are not subject to withholding and that are not withholdable payments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i). Therefore, under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership because it does not have actual knowledge that X's employer identification number begins with the digits ``98.'' Therefore, USP must treat X as a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient and report the payment on Form 1099 under section 6049. Under Sec. 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter, however, USP is not required to backup withhold on the payment unless it has actual knowledge that X is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The analysis is the same as under Example 5. However, F is a non-U.S. payor paying foreign source interest outside the United States, and there is no indication that the amount is received in the United States under Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(16). Thus, paragraph (b)(6) of this section exempts the payment from reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section that is not an FFI, makes a payment of U.S. source interest that is a withholdable payment to NQI, a nonqualified intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14), that is a certified deemed-compliant FFI under Sec. 1.1471-5(f)(2). The interest is paid inside the United States to an account of a bank or other financial institution maintained in the United States. NQI has provided USP with a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) that includes its chapter 4 status, but has not attached any documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a withholding statement as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis.

USP may treat the payment as made to a foreign intermediary under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(A) because USP has received a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate from NQI and may except NQI from withholding under chapter 4 of the Code given NQI's status for chapter 4 purposes as a deemed-compliant FFI. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, USP must then apply Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(3) to treat the persons on whose behalf NQI is acting as the payees. Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section also requires USP to apply the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) if it cannot reliably associate the payment with valid documentation from a payee. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). As the payment is a withholdable payment, the interest is treated as paid to a nonparticipating FFI under Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(4). Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section . See Sec. 1.1471-2(a) for the withholding requirement with respect to the payment and Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(2) for the requirement to report the payment on Form 1042-S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 7, except that the interest is paid outside the United States, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section to an offshore account, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is not a withholdable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(B), the interest is treated as paid to an unknown foreign payee because it cannot be reliably associated with documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section because the payment is presumed made to a foreign person. The payment is subject to withholding, however, under Sec. 1.1441-1(b) at a rate of 30% and is subject to reporting on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that the interest is paid by F, a non-U.S. payor, as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis and results are the same as in Example 8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, makes a payment of foreign source interest (other than deposit interest) to NQI, a foreign corporation and a nonqualified intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14). NQI has provided USP with a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii), but has not attached any documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a withholding statement as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Foreign source interest is not an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and is not a withholdable payment. See Sec. Sec. 1.1441-2(a) and 1.1473-1(a). Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that a payor may treat as paid to a foreign intermediary are treated as made to an exempt recipient described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c) absent actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient. Therefore, the foreign source interest is not subject to reporting on Form 1099.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section that is a bank. USP pays U.S. source original issue discount from the redemption of an obligation described in section 871(g)(1)(B) to NQI, a foreign corporation that is a nonqualified intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14). The redemption proceeds are not paid outside of the United States as they are paid with respect to an account NQI has with a branch of a bank in the United States. See Sec. 1.6049-5(e)(2). NQI provides a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) that includes a certification of its status as a registered deemed-compliant FFI but does not attach any payee documentation or a withholding statement described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, USP must treat the payment as made to an undocumented U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient and report the payment on Form 1099. Further, because the payment is made inside the United States, the exception to backup withholding with respect to offshore obligations contained in Sec. 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter does not apply, and the payment is subject to backup withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P, a payor, makes a payment to NQI of U.S. source interest on debt obligations issued prior to July 18, 1984 that mature 30 years from their issuance dates. Therefore, the interest does not qualify as portfolio interest under section 871(h) or 881(d). Additionally, the interest is not a withholdable payment under Sec. 1.1471-2(b) as the interest is a payment with respect to a grandfathered obligation for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code. NQI, a U.S. payor, is a nonqualified foreign intermediary, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14), and has furnished P a valid nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which it has attached a valid Form W-9 for A, and two valid beneficial owner Forms W-8, one for B and one for C. A is not an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6049-4(c). NQI furnishes a withholding statement, described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv), in which it allocates 20% of the U.S. source interest to A, but does not allocate the remaining 80% of the interest between B and C. B's withholding certificate indicates that B is a foreign pension fund, exempt from U.S. tax under the U.S. income tax treaty with Country T. C's withholding certificate indicates that C is a foreign corporation not entitled to a reduced rate of withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. As the interest is not a withholdable payment under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the interest even though NQI has not certified its status for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code. Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf NQI acts--A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 20% of the payment with valid documentation provided by A, P must treat 20% of the interest as paid to A, a U.S. person not exempt from reporting, and report the payment on Form 1099. P cannot reliably associate the remaining 80% of the payment with valid documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the interest is presumed paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph (b)(12) of this section, P is not required to report the interest presumed paid to a foreign person on Form 1099. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b), 80% of the interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the interest is reportable on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12, except that P can reliably associate 30% of the payment of interest to B, but cannot reliably associate the remaining 70 percent with A or C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the interest. Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf NQI acts--A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 30% of the payment with B, a foreign pensions fund exempt from withholding under an income tax treaty, P may treat that payment as paid to B and not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section. P cannot reliably associate the remaining 70% of the payment with valid documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the interest is presumed paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph (b)(12) of this section, P is not required to report the interest presumed paid to a foreign person on Form 1099. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b), 80% of the interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the interest is reportable on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12, except that P also makes a payment of foreign source interest to NQI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii), P may treat the foreign source interest as paid to an exempt recipient as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(c) and not subject to reporting on Form 1099 even though some or all of the foreign source interest may in fact be owned by A, the U.S. person that is not exempt from reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12, except that NQI is a non-U.S. payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as under Example 12 with respect to B and C. However, because NQI is a non-U.S. payor, it may under Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) allocate the portion of the payment to A to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding statement provided to P in lieu of furnishing the Form W-9 to P when NQI reports the payments in accordance with Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i). In such a case, provided that P obtains a certification form confirming NQI's status as a participating FFI, P is excepted from reporting the payment under paragraph (b)(14) of this section because P can reliably associate the payment with the documentation provided by NQI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of whether amounts are considered paid outside the United States--(1) In general. For purposes of section 6049 and this section, an amount is considered to be paid by a payor or middleman outside the United States if the payor or middleman completes the acts necessary to effect payment outside the United States. See paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section for further clarification of where amounts are considered paid. A payment shall not be considered to be made within the United States for purposes of section 6049 merely by reason of the fact that it is made on a draft drawn on a United States bank account or by a wire or other electronic transfer from a United States account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6049 and this section, an amount is considered to be paid by a payor or middleman outside the United States if the payor or middleman completes the acts necessary to effect payment outside the United States. See paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section for further clarification of where amounts are considered paid. A payment shall not be considered to be made within the United States for purposes of section 6049 merely by reason of the fact that it is made on a draft drawn on a United States bank account or by a wire or other electronic transfer from a United States account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts paid with respect to deposits or accounts with banks and other financial institutions. Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an amount paid by a bank or other financial institution with respect to a deposit or with respect to an account with the institution is considered paid at the branch or office at which the amount is credited unless the amount is collected by the financial institution as the agent of the payee. However, an amount will not be considered to be paid at the branch or office where the amount is considered to be credited unless the branch or office is a permanent place of business that is regularly maintained, occupied, and used to carry on a banking or similar financial business; the business is conducted by at least one employee of the branch or office who is regularly in attendance at such place of business during normal business hours; and the branch or office receives deposits and engages in one or more of the other activities described in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coupon bonds and discount obligations in bearer form. Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an amount paid with respect to a bond with coupons attached (including a certificate of deposit with detachable interest coupons) or a discount obligation that is not in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder) is considered to be paid where the coupon or the discount obligation is presented to the payor or its paying agent for payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign-targeted registered obligations. Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, where the payor is the issuer or the issuer's agent, an amount

is considered paid outside the United States with respect to a foreign-targeted registered obligation issued before January 1, 2016, as described in Sec. 1.871-14(e)(2), if either the amount is paid by transfer to an account maintained by the registered owner outside the United States, or by mail to an address of the registered owner outside the United States, or by credit to an international account. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the term international account means the book-entry account of a financial institution (within the meaning of section 871(h)(4)(B)) or of an international financial organization with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York maintains records that specifically identify an international financial organization or a financial institution (within the meaning of section 871(h)(4)(B)) as either a non-United States person or a foreign branch of a United States person as registered owner. An international financial organization is a central bank or monetary authority of a foreign government or a public international organization of which the United States is a member to the extent that such central bank, authority, or organization holds obligations solely for its own account and is exempt from tax under section 892 or 895.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The application of the provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A holds FC coupon bonds that are not in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder. FB, a foreign branch of DC, is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC. A does not have an account with FB. A presents a coupon from a FC bond for payment to FB at its office outside the United States. FB pays A with a check drawn against a bank account maintained in the United States. For purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of interest on the FC bond by FB to A is considered to be outside the United States under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Individual C deposits funds in an account with FB, a foreign country X branch of DB, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business. FB maintains an office and employees in foreign country X, accepts deposits, and conducts one or more of the other activities listed in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). The terms of C's deposit provide that it will be payable with accrued interest. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, FB is considered to pay the interest on C's deposit outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business, maintains FB, a branch in foreign country X. FB has an office and employees in foreign country X, accepts deposits, and engages in one or more of the other activities listed in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). D, a United States citizen, purchases a certificate of deposit issued in 1980 by FB. The certificate of deposit has a maturity of 20 years and has detachable interest coupons payable at six-month intervals. D presents some of the coupons at the U.S. office of DC and receives payment in cash. Because the coupon is presented to DC for payment within the United States, DC is considered to have made the payment within the United States under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. FB is recognized by both foreign country X and by the Federal Reserve Bank as a foreign country X branch of DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business. A local foreign country X bank serves as FB's resident agent in Country X. FB maintains no physical office or employees in foreign country X. All the records, accounts, and transactions of FB are handled at the United States office of DC. E deposits funds in an amount maintained with FB. Interest earned on the deposit is periodically credited to E's account with FB by employees of DC. For purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of the interest on E's deposit with FB is considered to be within the United States by reason of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. DC is a U.S. corporation. A holds bonds that were issued by DC in registered form under section 163(f), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act of 2010, and the regulations thereunder and that are foreign-targeted registered obligations as defined in Sec. 1.871-14(e)(2). DB, a commercial banking business, is the registrar of bonds issued by DC. Interest on the DC bonds is paid to A and other bondholders by check prepared by DB at its principal office inside the United States and mailed from there to A's address outside the United States. The check is drawn on a United States account maintained by DC with DB within the United States. The place of payment to A by DB of the interest on the DC bonds is considered to be outside the United States under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> through (g)(1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.6049-5(f) through (g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b)(6) through (8), (b)(10)(i) through (b)(11)(ii)(A), (b)(12), (b)(14) (b)(15), (c)(1) through (c)(4), (c)(5)(i)(F), (c)(6), (d)(1) through (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2)(i) through (iii), (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii)(A), (d)(4), and (e)(1) through (5) of this section apply to payments made after June 30, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Expiration date.
