                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest subject to reporting requirement. For purposes of  Sec. Sec. 1.6049-4, 1.6049-6 and this section, except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``interest'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest on an obligation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In registered form (as defined in Sec. 5f.103-1(c)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Of a type offered to the public. Principles consistent with  Sec. 5f.163-1 shall be applied to determine whether an obligation is of  a type offered to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking  business. Such term shall include deposits evidenced by time  certificates of deposit issued in any amount whether negotiable or non-   negotiable. The term ``interest'' includes payments to a mortgage escrow  account and amounts paid with respect to repurchase agreements and  banker's acceptances. Property which the payee receives from the payor  as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of interest) shall be interest  for purposes of section 6049. The amount subject to reporting is the  fair market value of such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts, whether or not designated as interest, paid or credited  by mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, building and  loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead associations, credit  unions, industrial loan associations or banks, or similar organizations,  in respect of deposits, face amount certificates, investment  certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Thus, even though  amounts paid or credited by such organizations with respect to deposits  are designated as ``dividends'', such amounts are included in the  definition of interest for purposes of section 6049. The term  ``interest'' includes payments to a mortgage escrow account and amounts  paid with respect to repurchase agreements. Property which the payee  receives from the payor as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of  interest) is ``interest'' for purposes of section 6049. The fair market  value of such property is the amount subject ot reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest on amounts held by insurance companies under an  agreement to pay interest thereon. Any increment in value of ``advance  premiums'', ``prepaid premiums'', or ``premium deposit funds'' which is  applied to the payment of premiums due on insurance policies, or made  available for withdrawal by the policyholder, shall be considered  interest subject to reporting. Interest that an insurance company pays  pursuant to an agreement with the policyholder to a beneficiary because  he payment due has been delayed is interest subject to reporting.  Interest subject to reporting also includes interest paid by insurance  companies with respect to policy ``dividend'' accumulations (see  sections 61 and 451 and the regulations thereunder for rules as to when  such interest is considered paid), and interest paid with respect to the  proceeds of insurance policies left with the insurer. The so-called  ``interest element'' in the case of annuity or installment payments  under life insurance or endowment contracts does not constitute interest  for purposes of section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interest on deposits with brokers as defined in section 6045(c)  and the regulations thereunder. Any payment made in lieu of interest to  a person whose obligation has been borrowed in connection with a short  sale or other similar transaction is subject to reporting under section  6049. See Sec. 1.6045-2T for reporting requirements with respect to  payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest. See Sec. 1.6045-2 for  reporting requirements with respect to payments in lieu of tax-exempt  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Interest paid on amounts held by investment companies as defined  in section 3 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. section 80-a) and  on amounts paid on pooled funds or trusts. The interest to be reported  with respect to a widely held fixed investment trust, as defined in  Sec. 1.671-5(b)(22), shall be the interest earned on the assets held by  the trust. See Sec. 1.671-5 for the reporting rules for widely held  fixed investment trusts (as defined under that section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest excluded from reporting requirement. The term interest  or original issue discount (OID) does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest on any obligation issued by a natural person as defined  in Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(2), irrespective of whether such interest is  collected on behalf of the holder of the obligation by a middleman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest on any obligation if such interest is exempt from  taxation under section 103(a), relating to certain governmental  obligations, or interest which is exempt from taxation under any other  provision of law without regard to the identity of the holder. The  holder of a tax exempt obligation that is not in registered form must  provide written certification to the payor (other than the issuer of the  obligation) that the obligation is exempt from taxation. A statement  that interest coupons are tax exempt on the envelope or shell commonly  used by financial institutions to process such coupons, signed by the  payee, will be   sufficient for this purpose if the envelope is properly completed (i.e.,  shows the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the  payee). A payor may rely on such written certification in treating such  interest as tax exempt for purposes of section 6049. See Sec. 1.6049- 4(d)(8) with respect to the requirement that the issuer of a taxable  obligation shall make an information return if such issuer receives an  envelope which improperly claims that the interest coupons contained  therein are tax exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this  section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest that a governmental unit pays with respect to tax  refunds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interest on deposits for security, such as deposits posted with  a public utility company. However, interest on deposits posted for  security with a person described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this  section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> through (8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any amount paid by an international organization described in  Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) (or its paying, transfer, or other agent  that is not also a payee's agent) with respect to an obligation of which  the international organization is the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (b)(11)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The obligation must have on its face, and on any detachable  coupons, the following statement (or a similar statement having the same  effect):</p><p class="depth0">By accepting this obligation, the holder represents and warrants  that it is not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient  described in section 6049(b)(4) and regulations under that section) and  that it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person (other  than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) and the  regulations under that section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the obligation is in registered form, it must be registered  in the name of an exempt recipient described in Sec. 1.6049- 4(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Amounts for the period that the debt obligation with respect to  which the interest arises represents an asset blocked as described in  Sec. 1.1441-2(e)(3). Payment of such amounts, including interest that  is past due and OID on obligations that mature on or before the date  that the assets are no longer blocked, is deemed to occur in accordance  with the rules of Sec. 1.1441-2(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> and (15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Amounts of interest as determined under the provisions of Sec.  1.446-3(g)(4) (dealing with interest in the case of a significant non- periodic payment with respect to a notional principal contract). Such  amounts are governed by the provisions of section 6041. See Sec.  1.6041-1(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> U.S. payor, U.S. middleman, non-U.S. payor, and non-U.S.  middleman. The terms payor and middleman have the meanings ascribed to  them under Sec. 1.6049-4(a). A non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman  means a payor or middleman other than a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman.  The term U.S. payor or U.S. middleman means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A person described in section 7701(a)(30)  (including a foreign branch or office of such person);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The government of the United States or the government of any  State or political subdivision thereof (or any agency or instrumentality  of any of the foregoing);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section  957(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year, one  or more of its partners are U.S. persons (as defined in Sec. 1.1441- 1(c)(2)) who, in the aggregate hold more than 50 percent of the income  or capital interest in the partnership or if, at any time during its tax  year, it is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross income of  which,   from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of its  taxable year preceding the collection or payment (or such part of such  period as the person has been in existence), was effectively connected  with the conduct of trade or business within the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> shall not apply if the U.S.  payor has actual knowledge or reason to know that the documentation is  unreliable or incorrect or that the income does not satisfy the  requirements for exemption under section 931, 932, or 933. For the rules  determining whether income is from sources within a possession of the  United States, see section 937(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payee may be an intermediary. If a payment is made to a person  described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) that has not provided an  intermediary withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i) but  the payor knows or has reason to know that the payee may be an  intermediary, the payor must apply the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A)  of this section. A payor has reason to know that such a person may be an  intermediary if that person has provided documentation as an  intermediary for another account with the same payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Short-term deposits and repurchase transactions. The provisions  of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and not paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of  this section shall apply to deposits with banks and other financial  institutions that remain on deposit for a period of two weeks or less,  to amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and repurchase  transaction that is completed within a period of two weeks or less, or  to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(7), (10) and (11) of this section  (relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(4))</em> shall be treated as  having paid to such holder during such calendar year an amount of  interest equal to the amount of original issue discount so includible  without regard to any reduction by reason of a purchase allowance under   sections 1232(a)(2)(C)(ii), 1232A (a)(6) or (b)(4) or a purchase at a  premium under 1232A(c)(4)(A) or paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1232-3.  Thus, the determination of the amount of original issue discount  includible in the gross income of any holder with respect to any  obligation shall be determined as if any holder of the obligation were  the original holder. However, see Sec. 1.6049-9 for the reporting of  premium for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014. In  the case of (1) an obligation to which section 1232A does not apply (for  example, a short-term government obligation as defined in section  1232(a)(3)) and (2) an obligation issued on or before December 31, 1982,  in bearer form, the amount of original issue discount includible in  gross income shall be treated as if paid in the calendar year in which  the date of maturity occurs or in which the date of redemption occurs if  redemption occurs before maturity. The amount subject to reporting on an  obligation issued in bearer form with a maturity at the date of issue of  more than 1 year (a long term obligation) is the amount of original  issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the  calendar year of maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before  maturity. The amount of original issue discount subject to reporting on  a long term obligation shall not be reduced to reflect any purchase  allowance. Discount on short term government obligations as defined in  section 1232(a)(3), such as Treasury bills, and discount on other  obligations with a maturity at the date of issue of not more than 1 year  (a short term obligation), including commercial paper, when paid at  maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before maturity, shall  constitute a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049. In  general, the amount subject to reporting on short term obligations is  the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the  original issue price. The procedure set forth in section 3455(b)(2)(B)  and Sec. 31.3455(b)-1(b)(3) for establishing the price at which a  holder purchased an obligation subsequent to the date of original issue  shall apply for purposes of section 6049. Original issue discount on an  obligation (including an obligation with a maturity of not more than six  months from the date of original issue) held by a nonresident alien  individual or foreign corporation is interest described in paragraph  (b)(1)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section and, therefore is not interest  subject to reporting under section 6049 unless it is described in Sec.  1.6049-8(a) (relating to deposit interest paid on or after January 1,  2013, to certain nonresident alien individuals).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of paragraphs  (b)(6) through (15), (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to payments  made after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.

The provisions of each of the  foregoing sections shall apply by substituting the term payor for the  term withholding agent. A payor or middleman may rely on a withholding  statement provided by a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity that  identifies a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (as  described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)) or, with respect to a withholdable  payment, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of recalcitrant account  holders (as described in Sec. 1.1471-4(d)(6)) provided that the payor  or middleman identifies the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity  that maintains the accounts (as   described in Sec. 1.1471-5(b)(5)) included in the chapter 4 withholding  rate pool as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or  registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) by  applying the rules in Sec. 1.1471-3(d)(4) or in Sec. 1.1471- 3(e)(4)(vi)(B), as applicable, for identifying the payee of a payment  (by substituting the term payor with the term withholding agent).

A payor retains a record of  documentary evidence reviewed by noting in its records the type of  documentation reviewed, the date the document was reviewed, the  document's identification number (if any), and whether such  documentation contained any U.S. indicia described in   Sec. 1.1441-7(b)(8).

The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FC is a foreign corporation that is not engaged in a  trade or business in the United States during the current calendar year.  D, an individual who is a resident and citizen of the United States,  holds a registered obligation issued by FC in a public offering.  Interest is paid on the obligation within the United States by DC, a  U.S. corporation that is the designated paying agent of FC. D does not  have an account with DC. Although interest paid on the obligation issued  by FC is foreign source, the interest paid by DC to D is considered to  be interest under paragraph (b)(6) of this section for purposes of  information reporting under section 6049 because it is not paid and  received outside the United States within the meaning of Sec. 1.6049- 4(f)(16).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that D is a  nonresident alien individual who has furnished DC with a Form W-8 in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). By reason of  paragraph (b)(12) of this section, the payment of interest by DC to D is  not considered to be a payment of interest for purposes of information  reporting under section 6049. Therefore, DC is not required to make an  information return under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that the  obligation of FC is held in a custodial account for D by FB, a foreign  branch of a U.S. financial institution. By reason of paragraph (c)(5) of  this section, FB is considered to be a U.S. middleman. Therefore, FB is  required to make an information return unless FB may treat D as a  beneficial owner that is a foreign person in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that the FC  obligation is held for D by NC, in a custodial account at NC's foreign  branch. NC is a foreign corporation that is a non-U.S. middleman  described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The payment by NC to D is  paid and received outside of the United States under Sec. 1.6049- 4(f)(16) and therefore is not considered to be a payment of interest for  purposes of section 6049 pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.  Therefore, NC is not required to make an information return under  section 6049 with respect to the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> in the case of a  payment of an amount that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3  of the Code and that is not a withholdable payment (as defined in Sec.  1.6049-4(f)(15)). Amounts are not subject to withholding under chapter 3  of the Code if they are not included in the definition of amounts  subject to withholding under Sec. 1.1441-2(a) (e.g., deposit interest  with foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign source income, or broker  proceeds). The exceptions to the application of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) to  amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code  and that are not withholdable payments are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(ii), dealing with  payments to a U.S. agent or intermediary of a foreign person, shall not  apply. Thus, a payment to a U.S. agent or intermediary of a foreign  person is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments to U.S. branches or territory financial institution  described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as payments to a  foreign payee, irrespective of the fact that the U.S. branch or  territory financial institution is otherwise treated as a U.S. person  for payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 and  withholdable payments, and irrespective of the fact that the branch or  territory financial institution is treated as a U.S. payor for purposes  of paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>  applies), the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> through (ix) and  Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply (by applying the term payor  instead of the term withholding agent) to determine the classification  (e.g., individual, corporation, partnership, trust), status (i.e., a  U.S. or a foreign person), and other relevant characteristics (e.g.,  beneficial owner or intermediary) of a payee if a payment cannot be  reliably associated with valid documentation under Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(2)(vii) irrespective of whether the payments are subject to  withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or are withholdable payments.  The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) (referencing  presumption rules for payments with respect to offshore obligations)  shall not apply to a payment of an amount not subject to withholding  under chapter 3, unless it is an amount that is a withholdable payment  made to a payee that is an entity. Thus, in the case of a withholdable  payment made to an entity, the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) shall apply regardless of whether the  payment is an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3.  Additionally, in the case of an amount paid outside the United States  with respect to an offshore obligation described in Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(3)(iii)(D) or (vii)(B) of an amount not subject to withholding  under chapter 3 and that is treated as made to a payee that is an  individual, the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) shall not  apply, and the payee shall be presumed a U.S. person only when the payee  has any of the indicia of U.S. status that are described in Sec.  1.1441-7(b)(5) or (8). In a case in which a withholding agent makes a  withholdable payment that cannot reliably be associated with  documentation, see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(4) and (5) for determining the  status of the payee for chapter 4 purposes when the payment is treated  as made to a foreign entity (by applying the term payor instead of the  term withholding agent). The rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) shall  apply for purposes of determining when a payment can reliably be  associated with documentation, by applying the term payor instead of the  term withholding agent. For this purpose, the information, documentary  evidence, statement, or other documentation described in paragraph  (c)(4) of this section can be treated as documentation with which a  payment can be associated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>,  the grace period described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section shall  apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, therefore, no information return  shall be required under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments of amounts not subject to withholding under chapter 3  of the Code and that are not withholdable payments.

In the case of such actual knowledge, the payor shall  treat the payment that it knows is allocable to such U.S. person as a  payment to a U.S. payee who is not an exempt recipient and has actual  knowledge of the amount allocable to such a person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for payments of certain short-term original issue  discount--(A) General rule.

See Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(2). However,  a payor may rely on a withholding statement provided by an intermediary  described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) (or similar withholding statement  for a flow-through entity) that identifies a chapter 4 withholding rate  pool of U.S. payees (as described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)) only if  it identifies the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity as a  participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered  deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) under Sec.  1.1471-3(d)(4) (by substituting the term payor with the term withholding  agent).

USP does not have a Form W-9, or  withholding certificate from X as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16).

Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions  of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether X  is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S.  partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The  presumption of U.S. status applies even though the payment is a  withholdable payment (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section and Sec.  1.1471-3(f)(2) cross referencing the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(3)). The U.S. source interest paid to X is reportable under section  6049 on Form 1099 and the interest is subject to backup withholding  under section 3406 because X has not provided its TIN on a valid Form W- 9. No withholding or reporting applies to the payment under chapter 3 or  4 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  that the interest paid by USP is from sources outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does  not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be  presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation.  Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions  of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether,  X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S.  partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The  foreign source interest is a payment subject to reporting on Form 1099  under Sec. 1.6049-5(a). Further, because X is a non-exempt recipient  that has failed to provide its TIN on a valid Form W-9, the foreign  source interest is subject to backup withholding under section 3406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section. USP makes a payment of U.S. source interest  outside the United States to an offshore account of X. See paragraphs  (c)(1) for a definition of offshore account and (e) for a payment  outside the United States. USP does not have a withholding certificate  from X as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16) nor does it have documentary  evidence as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii)(A)(2) and Sec.  1.6049-5(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does  not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be  presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation.  Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions  of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether,  X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under Sec. Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a foreign  partnership. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and Sec.  1.1441-5(c)(1)(i)(E), the payees of the interest are presumed to be the  partners of X. Under Sec. 1.1441-5(d)(3), the partners are presumed to  be undocumented foreign persons.   Therefore, USP must withhold 30% of the interest payment under Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(1) and report the payment on Form 1042-S in accordance with  Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except  that the interest is paid by F, a non-U.S. payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis and result are the same as in Example 3.  F is a withholding agent under Sec. 1.1441-7 and its status as a non- U.S. payor under paragraph (c)(5) of this section is irrelevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and 1.6049-5(c)(1). USP does not have actual knowledge of an  employer identification number for X. X does not appear to be an  individual, trust, or estate and cannot be treated as an exempt  recipient, as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) in the absence of  documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, X is treated as a  partnership, since it does not appear to be an individual, trust, or  estate and cannot be treated as an exempt recipient without  documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply  the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to  determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership.  Paragraph (d)(2)(i) also states that the presumptions of foreign status  for payments made with respect to offshore obligations contained in  Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2) do not apply to  amounts that are not subject to withholding and that are not  withholdable payments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i). Therefore, under  Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a  U.S. partnership because it does not have actual knowledge that X's  employer identification number begins with the digits ``98.'' Therefore,  USP must treat X as a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient and  report the payment on Form 1099 under section 6049. Under Sec.  31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter, however, USP is not required to backup  withhold on the payment unless it has actual knowledge that X is a U.S.  person that is not an exempt recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except  that the interest is paid by F, a non-U.S. payor, as defined under  paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as under Example 5. However,  F is a non-U.S. payor paying foreign source interest outside the United  States, and there is no indication that the amount is received in the  United States under Sec. 1.6049-4(f)(16). Thus, paragraph (b)(6) of  this section exempts the payment from reporting under section 6049.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section that is not an FFI, makes a payment of U.S.  source interest that is a withholdable payment to NQI, a nonqualified  intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14), that is a certified  deemed-compliant FFI under Sec. 1.1471-5(f)(2). The interest is paid  inside the United States to an account of a bank or other financial  institution maintained in the United States. NQI has provided USP with a  nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, as described in Sec.  1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) that includes its chapter 4 status, but has not  attached any documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a  withholding statement as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. U.S. source interest is an amount subject to  withholding under Sec. 1.1441-2(a). USP may treat the payment as made  to a foreign intermediary under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(A) because USP  has received a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate from  NQI and may except NQI from withholding under chapter 4 of the Code  given NQI's status for chapter 4 purposes as a deemed-compliant FFI.  Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, USP must then apply Sec.  1.1471-3(c)(3) to treat the persons on whose behalf NQI is acting as the  payees. Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section also requires USP to apply  the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) if it cannot reliably  associate the payment with valid documentation from a payee. See Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). As the payment is a withholdable payment, the  interest is treated as paid to a nonparticipating FFI under Sec.  1.1471-3(f)(4). Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on  Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section . See Sec. 1.1471- 2(a) for the withholding requirement with respect to the payment and  Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(2) for the requirement to report the payment on Form  1042-S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 7, except  that the interest is paid outside the United States, as defined in  paragraph (e) of this section to an offshore account, as defined in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is not a withholdable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(B), the interest is  treated as paid to an unknown foreign payee because it cannot be  reliably associated with documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii).  Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under  paragraph (b)(12) of this section because the payment is presumed made  to a foreign person. The payment is subject to withholding, however,  under Sec. 1.1441-1(b) at a rate of 30% and is subject to reporting on  Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The analysis and results are the same as in Example  8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section, makes a payment of foreign source interest  (other than deposit interest) to NQI, a foreign corporation and a  nonqualified intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14). NQI has  provided USP with a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate,  as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii), but has not attached any  documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a withholding  statement as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, amounts that are not subject to withholding  under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments  described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that a payor may treat  as paid to a foreign intermediary are treated as made to an exempt  recipient described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c) absent actual knowledge that  the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient. Therefore,  the foreign source interest is not subject to reporting on Form 1099.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section that is a bank. USP pays U.S. source original  issue discount from the redemption of an obligation described in section  871(g)(1)(B) to NQI, a foreign corporation that is a nonqualified  intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14). The redemption  proceeds are not paid outside of the United States as they are paid with  respect to an account NQI has with a branch of a bank in the United  States. See Sec. 1.6049-5(e)(2). NQI provides a nonqualified  intermediary withholding certificate as described in Sec. 1.1441- 1(e)(3)(iii) that includes a certification of its status as a registered  deemed-compliant FFI but does not attach any payee documentation or a  withholding statement described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> of this section, USP  must treat the payment as made to an undocumented U.S. payee that is not  an exempt recipient and report the payment on Form 1099. Further,  because the payment is made inside the United States, the exception to  backup withholding with respect to offshore obligations contained in  Sec. 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter does not apply, and the payment is  subject to backup withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P, a payor, makes a payment to NQI of U.S.  source interest on debt obligations issued prior to July 18, 1984 that  mature 30 years from their issuance dates. Therefore, the interest does  not qualify as portfolio interest under section 871(h) or 881(d).  Additionally, the interest is not a withholdable payment under Sec.  1.1471-2(b) as the interest is a payment with respect to a grandfathered  obligation for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code. NQI, a U.S. payor, is  a nonqualified foreign intermediary, as defined in Sec. 1.1441- 1(c)(14), and has furnished P a valid nonqualified intermediary  withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which  it has attached a valid Form W-9 for A, and two valid beneficial owner  Forms W-8, one for B and one for C. A is not an exempt recipient under  Sec. 1.6049-4(c). NQI furnishes a withholding statement, described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv), in which it allocates 20% of the U.S. source  interest to A, but does not allocate the remaining 80% of the interest  between B and C. B's withholding certificate indicates that B is a  foreign pension fund, exempt from U.S. tax under the U.S. income tax  treaty with Country T. C's withholding certificate indicates that C is a  foreign corporation not entitled to a reduced rate of withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. As the interest is not a withholdable payment under  paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies the rules of Sec.  1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the interest even though  NQI has not certified its status for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code.  Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf NQI  acts--A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 20% of the payment  with valid documentation provided by A, P must treat 20% of the interest  as paid to A, a U.S. person not exempt from reporting, and report the  payment on Form 1099. P cannot reliably associate the remaining 80% of  the payment with valid documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)  and, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the  presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the  interest is presumed paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph  (b)(12) of this section, P is not required to report the interest  presumed paid to a foreign person on Form 1099. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b),  80% of the interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the  interest is reportable on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12,  except that P can reliably associate 30% of the payment of interest to  B, but cannot reliably associate the remaining 70 percent with A or C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies  the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the  interest. Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf  NQI acts--A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 30% of the  payment with B, a foreign pensions fund exempt from withholding under an  income tax treaty, P may treat that payment as paid to B and not subject  to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section. P  cannot reliably associate the remaining 70% of the payment with valid  documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and, therefore, under  paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the presumption rules of  Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the interest is presumed  paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph (b)(12) of this  section, P is not required to report the interest presumed paid to a  foreign person on Form 1099. Under Sec. 1.1441-1(b), 80% of the  interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the interest is  reportable on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12,  except that P also makes a payment of foreign source interest to NQI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, P may treat the foreign  source interest as paid to an exempt recipient as defined in Sec.  1.6049-4(c) and not subject to reporting on Form 1099 even though some  or all of the foreign source interest may in fact be owned by A, the  U.S. person that is not exempt from reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 12,  except that NQI is a non-U.S. payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as under Example 12 with  respect to B and C. However, because NQI is a non-U.S. payor, it may  under Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) allocate the portion of the payment to A  to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding  statement provided to P in lieu of furnishing the Form W-9 to P when NQI  reports the payments in accordance with Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i). In such  a case, provided that P obtains a certification form confirming NQI's  status as a participating FFI, P is excepted from reporting the payment  under paragraph (b)(14) of this section because P can reliably associate  the payment with the documentation provided by NQI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of whether amounts are considered paid outside the  United States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6049 and this  section, an amount is considered to be paid by a payor or middleman  outside the United States if the payor or middleman completes the acts  necessary to effect payment outside the United States. See paragraphs  (e)(2) through (5) of this section for further clarification of where  amounts are considered paid. A payment shall not be considered to be  made within the United States for purposes of section 6049 merely by  reason of the fact that it is made on a draft drawn on a United States  bank account or by a wire or other electronic transfer from a United  States account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts paid with respect to deposits or accounts with banks and  other financial institutions. Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this  section, an amount paid by a bank or other financial institution with  respect to a deposit or with respect to an account with the institution  is considered paid at the branch or office at which the amount is  credited unless the amount is collected by the financial institution as  the agent of the payee. However, an amount will not be considered to be  paid at the branch or office where the amount is considered to be  credited unless the branch or office is a permanent place of business  that is regularly maintained, occupied, and used to carry on a banking  or similar financial business; the business is conducted by at least one  employee of the branch or office who is regularly in attendance at such  place of business during normal business hours; and the branch or office  receives deposits and engages in one or more of the other activities  described in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coupon bonds and discount obligations in bearer form.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an amount paid with  respect to a bond with coupons attached (including a certificate of  deposit with detachable interest coupons) or a discount obligation that  is not in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the  regulations thereunder) is considered to be paid where the coupon or the  discount obligation is presented to the payor or its paying agent for  payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(B))</em> as either a non-United States  person or a foreign branch of a United States person as registered  owner. An international financial organization is a central bank or  monetary authority of a foreign government or a public international  organization of which the United States is a member to the extent that  such central bank, authority, or organization holds obligations solely  for its own account and is exempt from tax under section 892 or 895.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The application of the provisions of this paragraph  (e) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or  U.S. middleman, as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A holds  FC coupon bonds that are not in registered form under section 163(f) and  the regulations thereunder. FB, a foreign branch of DC, is the  designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC. A does  not have an account with FB. A presents a coupon from a FC bond for  payment to FB at its office outside the United States. FB pays A with a  check drawn against a bank account maintained in the United States. For  purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of interest on the FC  bond by FB to A is considered to be outside the United States under  paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Individual C deposits funds in an account with FB, a  foreign country X branch of DB, a U.S. corporation engaged in the  commercial banking business. FB maintains an office and employees in  foreign country X, accepts deposits, and conducts one or more of the  other activities listed in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). The terms of C's  deposit provide that it will be payable with accrued interest. Under  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, FB is considered to pay the interest  on C's deposit outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking  business, maintains FB, a branch in foreign country X. FB has an office  and employees in foreign country X, accepts deposits, and engages in one  or more of the other activities listed in Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). D, a  United States citizen, purchases a certificate of deposit issued in 1980  by FB. The certificate of deposit has a maturity of 20 years and has  detachable interest coupons payable at six-month intervals. D presents  some of the coupons at the U.S. office of DC and receives payment in  cash. Because the coupon is presented to DC for payment within the  United States, DC is considered to have made the payment within the  United States under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. FB is recognized by both foreign country X and by the  Federal Reserve Bank as a foreign country X branch of DC, a U.S.  corporation engaged in the commercial banking business. A local foreign  country X bank serves as FB's resident agent in Country X. FB maintains  no physical office or employees in foreign country X. All the records,  accounts, and transactions of FB are handled at the United States office  of DC. E deposits funds in an amount maintained with FB. Interest earned  on the deposit is periodically credited to E's account with FB by  employees of DC. For purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of  the interest on E's deposit with FB is considered to be within the  United States by reason of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. DC is a U.S. corporation. A holds bonds that were issued  by DC in registered form under section 163(f), as in effect prior to the  amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act of 2010, and the regulations  thereunder and that are foreign-targeted registered obligations as  defined in Sec. 1.871-14(e)(2). DB, a commercial banking business, is  the registrar of bonds issued by DC. Interest on the DC bonds is paid to  A and other bondholders by check prepared by DB at its principal office  inside the United States and mailed from there to A's address outside  the United States. The check is drawn on a United States account  maintained by DC with DB within the United States. The place of payment  to A by DB of the interest on the DC bonds is considered to be outside  the United States under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> through (g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through  (iii), (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii)(A), (d)(4), and (e)(1) through (5)  of this section apply to payments made after June 30, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Expiration date. The applicability of this section expires on  February 28, 2017.

However, before January 1, 1987, reporting is required only  with respect to certificates of deposit (or any such other obligations)  held by a broker or middleman as a nominee on or after June 1, 1986,  that were sold by the broker or middleman (whether for the broker's  account or as an agent of the issuer) to the owner. The preceding two  sentences do not apply to certificates of deposit (or any such other  obligations) held on or after January 1, 1986, but disposed of before  June 1, 1986; reporting requirements with respect to such certificates  of deposit (or any other such obligations) shall be determined under the  provisions of Sec. 1.6049-5 (c) as in effect immediately prior to  publication of this Sec. 1.6049-5T.
