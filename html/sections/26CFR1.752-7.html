                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and structure. The purpose of this section is to prevent the acceleration or duplication of loss through the assumption of obligations not described in Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(i) in transactions involving partnerships. Under paragraph (c) of this section, any such obligation that is assumed by a partnership from a partner in a transaction governed by section 721(a) is treated as section 704(c) property. Paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section provide rules for situations where a partnership assumes such an obligation from a partner and, subsequently, that partner transfers all or part of the partnership interest, that partner receives a distribution in liquidation of the partnership interest, or another partner assumes part or all of that obligation from the partnership. These rules prevent the duplication of loss by prohibiting the partnership and any person other than the partner from whom the obligation was assumed from claiming a deduction, loss, or capital expense to the extent of the built-in loss associated with the obligation. These rules also prevent the acceleration of loss by deferring the partner's deduction or loss attributable to the obligation (if any) until the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section). Paragraph (d) of this section provides a number of exceptions to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, including a de minimis exception. Paragraph (i) provides a special rule for situations in which an amount paid to satisfy a Sec. 1.752-7 liability is capitalized into other partnership property. Paragraph (j) of this section provides special rules for tiered partnership transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assumption. The principles of Sec. 1.752-1(d) and (e) apply in determining if a Sec. 1.752-7 liability has been assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjusted value. The adjusted value of a partner's interest in a partnership is the fair market value of that interest increased by the partner's share of partnership liabilities under Sec. Sec. 1.752-1 through 1.752-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sec. 1.752-7 liability--(i) In general. A Sec. 1.752-7 liability is an obligation described in Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(ii) to the extent that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A Sec. 1.752-7 liability is an obligation described in Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(ii) to the extent that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The obligation is not described in Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(i); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the obligation (under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) exceeds the amount taken into account under Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount and share of Sec. 1.752-7 liability. The amount of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability (or, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of an obligation) is the amount of cash that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the Sec. 1.752-7 liability in an arm's-length transaction. If the obligation arose under a contract in exchange for rights granted to the obligor under that contract, and those

contractual rights are contributed to the partnership in connection with the partnership's assumption of the contractual obligation, then the amount of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability or obligation is the amount of cash, if any, that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the entire contract. A partner's share of a partnership's Sec. 1.752-7 liability is the amount of deduction that would be allocated to the partner with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability if the partnership disposed of all of its assets, satisfied all of its liabilities (other than Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities), and paid an unrelated person to assume all of its Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities in a fully taxable arm's-length transaction (assuming such payment would give rise to an immediate deduction to the partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. In 2005, A, B, and C form partnership PRS. A contributes $10,000,000 in exchange for a 25% interest in PRS and PRS's assumption of a debt obligation. The debt obligation was issued for cash and the issue price was equal to the stated redemption price at maturity ($5,000,000). The debt obligation bears interest, payable quarterly, at a fixed rate of interest, which was a market rate of interest when the debt obligation was issued. At the time of the assumption, all accrued interest has been paid. Prior to the partnership assuming the obligation, interest rates decrease, resulting in the debt obligation bearing an above-market interest rate. Assume that, as a result of the decline in interest rates, A would have had to pay a willing assignee $6,000,000 to assume the debt obligation. The assumption of the debt obligation by PRS from A is treated as an assumption of a Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(i) liability in the amount of $5,000,000 (the portion of the total amount of the debt obligation that has created basis in A's assets, that is, the $5,000,000 that was issued in exchange for the debt obligation) and an assumption of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability in the amount of $1,000,000 (the difference between the total obligation, $6,000,000, and the Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)(i)liability, $5,000,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer is any assumption of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability by a partnership from a partner in a transaction governed by section 721(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer is any assumption of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability by a partnership from a partner in a transaction governed by section 721(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Terminations under section 708(b)(1)(B). In determining if a deemed contribution of assets and assumption of liability as a result of a technical termination is treated as a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, only Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities that were assumed by the terminating partnership as part of an earlier Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer are taken into account and, then, only to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with that Sec. 1.752-7 liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner--(i) In general. A Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner is a partner from whom a partnership assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability as part of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer or any person who acquires a partnership interest from the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner is a partner from whom a partnership assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability as part of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer or any person who acquires a partnership interest from the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tiered partnerships--(A) Assumption by a lower-tier partnership. If, in a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, a partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability from another partnership (upper-tier partnership), then both the upper-tier partnership and the partners of the upper-tier partnership are Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners. Therefore, paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply on a sale or liquidation of any partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership and on a sale or liquidation of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership. See paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If, in a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, the upper-tier partnership assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability from a partner, and, subsequently, in another Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, a lower-tier partnership assumes that Sec. 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the partner from whom the upper-tier partnership assumed the Sec. 1.752-7 liability continues to be the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of the lower-tier partnership with respect to the remaining built-in loss associated with that Sec. 1.752-7 liability. Any new built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability that is created on the assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership by the lower-tier partnership is shared by all

the partners of the upper-tier partnership in accordance with their interests in the upper-tier partnership, and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that new built-in loss. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii), Example 3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assumption by a lower-tier partnership. If, in a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, a partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability from another partnership (upper-tier partnership), then both the upper-tier partnership and the partners of the upper-tier partnership are Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners. Therefore, paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply on a sale or liquidation of any partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership and on a sale or liquidation of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership. See paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If, in a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, the upper-tier partnership assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability from a partner, and, subsequently, in another Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer, a lower-tier partnership assumes that Sec. 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the partner from whom the upper-tier partnership assumed the Sec. 1.752-7 liability continues to be the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of the lower-tier partnership with respect to the remaining built-in loss associated with that Sec. 1.752-7 liability. Any new built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability that is created on the assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership by the lower-tier partnership is shared by all

the partners of the upper-tier partnership in accordance with their interests in the upper-tier partnership, and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that new built-in loss. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii), Example 3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Distribution of partnership interest. If, in a transaction described in Sec. 1.752-7(e)(3), an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) that has assumed a Sec. 1.752-7 liability is distributed by a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that is the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that liability, then the persons receiving interests in the lower-tier partnership are Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to the lower-tier partnership to the same extent that they were prior to the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Remaining built-in loss associated with a Sec. 1.752-7 liability. (i) In general. The remaining built-in loss associated with a Sec. 1.752-7 liability equals the amount of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability as of the time of the assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by the partnership, reduced by the portion of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability previously taken into account by the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner under paragraph (j)(3) of this section and adjusted as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 1.704-3 for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The remaining built-in loss associated with a Sec. 1.752-7 liability equals the amount of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability as of the time of the assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by the partnership, reduced by the portion of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability previously taken into account by the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner under paragraph (j)(3) of this section and adjusted as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 1.704-3 for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any portion of that built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability that is satisfied by the partnership on or prior to the testing date (whether capitalized or deducted); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any assumption of all or part of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner (including any assumption that occurs on the testing date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partial dispositions and assumptions. In the case of a partial disposition of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest or a partial assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by another partner, the remaining built-in loss associated with Sec. 1.752-7 liability is pro rated based on the portion of the interest sold or the portion of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction--(i) In general. The Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is the amount by which the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner is required to reduce the basis in the partner's partnership interest by operation of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. The Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is the amount by which the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner is required to reduce the basis in the partner's partnership interest by operation of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. The Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The excess of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest over the adjusted value of that interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section without regard to paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partial dispositions and assumptions. In the case of a partial disposition of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest or a partial assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by another partner, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is pro rated based on the portion of the interest sold or the portion of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Satisfaction of Sec. 1.752-7 liability--In general. A Sec. 1.752-7 liability is treated as satisfied (in whole or in part) on the date on which the partnership (or the assuming partner) would have been allowed to take the Sec. 1.752-7 liability into account for federal tax purposes but for this section. For example, a Sec. 1.752-7 liability is treated as satisfied when, but for this section, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would give rise to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An increase in the basis of the partnership's or the assuming partner's assets (including cash);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An immediate deduction to the partnership or to the assuming partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An expense that is not deductible in computing the partnership's or the assuming partner's taxable income and not properly chargeable to capital account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An amount realized on the sale or other disposition of property subject to that liability if the property was disposed of by the partnership or the assuming partner at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Testing date. The testing date is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the date of the sale, exchange, or other disposition of part or all of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the date of the partnership's distribution in liquidation of the

Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the date of the assumption (or partial assumption) of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by a partner other than the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Trade or business--(i) In general. A trade or business is a specific group of activities carried on by a person for the purpose of earning income or profit, other than a group of activities consisting of acquiring, holding, dealing in, or disposing of financial instruments, if the activities included in that group include every operation that forms a part of, or a step in, the process of earning income or profit. Such group of activities ordinarily includes the collection of income and the payment of expenses. The group of activities must constitute the carrying on of a trade or business under section 162(a) (determined as though the activities were conducted by an individual).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The group of activities must constitute the carrying on of a trade or business under section 162(a) (determined as though the activities were conducted by an individual).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(10):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation Y owns, manages, and derives rental income from an office building and also owns vacant land that may be subject to environmental liabilities. Corporation Y contributes the land subject to the environmental liabilities to PRS in a transaction governed by section 721(a). PRS plans to develop the land as a landfill. The contribution of the vacant land does not constitute the contribution of a trade or business because Corporation Y did not conduct any significant business or development activities with respect to the land prior to the contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For the past 5 years, Corporation X has owned and operated gas stations in City A, City B, and City C. Corporation X transfers all of the assets associated with the operation of the gas station in City A to PRS for interests in PRS and the assumption by PRS of the Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities associated with that gas station. PRS continues to operate the gas station in City A after the contribution. The contribution of the gas station to PRS constitutes the contribution of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. For the past 7 years, Corporation Z has engaged in the manufacture and sale of household products. Throughout this period, Corporation Z has maintained a research department for use in connection with its manufacturing activities. The research department has 10 employees actively engaged in the development of new products. Corporation Z contributes the research department to PRS in exchange for a PRS interest and the assumption by PRS of pension liabilities with respect to the employees of the research department. PRS continues the research operations on a contractual basis with several businesses, including Corporation Z. The contribution of the research operations to PRS constitutes a contribution of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of section 704(b) and (c) to assumed Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities--(1) In general--(i) Section 704(c). Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 704(c)(1)(A) and (B), section 737, and the regulations thereunder, apply to Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities. See Sec. 1.704-3(a)(12). However, Sec. 1.704-3(a)(7) does not apply to any person who acquired a partnership interest from a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--(i) Section 704(c). Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 704(c)(1)(A) and (B), section 737, and the regulations thereunder, apply to Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities. See Sec. 1.704-3(a)(12). However, Sec. 1.704-3(a)(7) does not apply to any person who acquired a partnership interest from a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 704(c). Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 704(c)(1)(A) and (B), section 737, and the regulations thereunder, apply to Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities. See Sec. 1.704-3(a)(12). However, Sec. 1.704-3(a)(7) does not apply to any person who acquired a partnership interest from a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 704(b). Section 704(b) and Sec. 1.704-1(b) apply to a post-contribution change in the value of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability. If there is a decrease in the value of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability that is reflected in the capital accounts of the partners under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the amount of the decrease constitutes an item of income for purposes of section 704(b) and Sec. 1.704-1(b). Conversely, if there is an increase in the value of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability that is reflected in the capital accounts of the partners under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the amount of the increase constitutes an item of loss for purposes of section 704(b) and Sec. 1.704-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2004, A, B, and C form partnership PRS. A contributes Property 1 with a fair market value and basis of $400X, subject to a Sec. 1.752-7 liability of $100X, for a 25% interest in PRS. B contributes $300X cash for a 25% interest in PRS, and C contributes $600X cash for a 50% interest in PRS. Assume that the partnership complies with the substantial economic effect safe harbor of Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2). Under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(b), A's capital account is credited with $300X (the fair market value of Property 1, $400X, less the Sec. 1.752-7 liability assumed by PRS, $100X). In accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.752-7(c)(1)(i) and 1.704-3, the partnership can use any reasonable method for section 704(c) purposes. In this case, the partnership elects the traditional method under Sec. 1.704-3(b) and also elects to treat the deductions or losses attributable to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability as coming first from the built-in loss. In 2005,

PRS earns $200X of income and uses it to satisfy the Sec. 1.752-7 liability which has increased in value to $200X. Assume that the cost to PRS of satisfying the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is deductible by PRS. The $200X of partnership income is allocated according to the partnership agreement, $50X to A, $50X to B, and $100X to C.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, $100X of the deduction attributable to the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is specially allocated to A, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner, under section 704(c)(1)(A) and Sec. 1.704-3. No book item corresponds to this tax allocation. The remaining $100X of deduction attributable to the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is allocated, for both book and tax purposes, according to the partnership agreement, $25X to A, $25X to B, and $50X to C. If the partnership, instead, satisfied the Sec. 1.752-7 liability over a number of years, the first $100X of deduction with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would be allocated to A, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner, before any deduction with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would be allocated to the other partners. For example, if PRS were to satisfy $50X of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, the $50X deduction with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would be allocated to A for tax purposes only. No deduction would arise for book purposes. If PRS later paid a further $100X in satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $50X of the deduction with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would be allocated, solely for tax purposes, to A and the remaining $50X would be allocated, for both book and tax purposes, according to the partnership agreement. Under these circumstances, the partnership's method of allocating the built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for transfers of partnership interests, distributions of partnership assets, and assumptions of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability after a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer--(1) In general.

In 2004, Corporation X contributes Business A, in a transaction governed by section 721(a), to PRS in exchange for a PRS interest and the assumption by PRS of pension liabilities with respect to the employees engaged in Business A. PRS plans to carry on Business A after the contribution. Because PRS has assumed the pension liabilities as part of a contribution to PRS of the trade or business with which the liabilities are associated, the treatment of the pension liabilities is not affected by paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section with respect to any transaction occurring after the Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer of the pension liabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that PRS also assumes from Corporation X certain pension liabilities with respect to the employees of Business B. At the time of the assumption,

the amount of the pension liabilities with respect to the employees of Business A is $3,000,000 (the A liabilities) and the amount of the pension liabilities associated with the employees of Business B (the B liabilities) is $2,000,000. Two years later, Corporation X sells its interest in PRS to Y for $9,000,000. At the time of the sale, the remaining built-in loss associated with the A liabilities is $2,100,000, the remaining built-in loss associated with the B liabilities is $900,000, and the gross value of PRS's assets (excluding Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities) is $20,000,000. Assume that PRS has no Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities other than those assumed from Corporation X.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The only liabilities assumed by PRS from Corporation X that were not assumed as part of Corporation X's contribution of Business A were the B liabilities. Immediately before the testing date, the remaining built-in loss associated with the B liabilities ($900,000) was less than the lesser of 10% of the gross value of PRS's assets ($2,000,000) or $1,000,000. Therefore, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section applies to exclude Corporation X's sale of the PRS interest to Y from the application of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transfer of Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(3), and (i) of this section, immediately before the sale, exchange, or other disposition of all or a part of a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest is reduced by the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section). No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to the partnership on the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section) to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section). For purposes of section 705(a)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b) only, the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is not treated as a nondeductible, noncapital expenditure of the partnership. Therefore, the remaining partners' capital accounts and bases in their partnership interests are not reduced by the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability. If the partnership (or any successor) notifies the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, then the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner is entitled to a loss or deduction. The amount of that deduction or loss is, in the case of a partial satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the partial satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (but not, in total, more than the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction) or, in the case of a complete satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, the remaining Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction. To the extent of the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, the character of that deduction or loss is determined as if the Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner had satisfied the liability.

No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to the partnership on the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section) to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section).

The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2004, A, B, and C form partnership PRS. A contributes Property 1 with a fair market value of $5,000,000 and basis of $4,000,000 subject to a Sec. 1.752-7 liability of $2,000,000 in exchange for a 25% interest in PRS. B contributes $3,000,000 cash in exchange for a 25% interest in PRS, and C contributes $6,000,000 cash in exchange for a 50% interest in PRS. In 2006, when PRS has a section 754 election in effect, A sells A's interest in PRS to D for $3,000,000. At the time of the sale, the basis of A's PRS interest is $4,000,000, the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is $2,000,000, and PRS has no liabilities (as defined in Sec. 1.752-1(a)(4)). Assume that none of the exceptions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply and that the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would have given rise to a deductible expense to A. In 2007, PRS pays $3,000,000 to satisfy the liability.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.002</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sale of A's PRS interest. Immediately before the sale of the PRS interest to D, A's basis in the PRS interest is reduced (to $3,000,000) by the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction, i.e., the lesser of the excess of A's basis in the PRS interest ($4,000,000) over the adjusted value of that interest ($3,000,000), $1,000,000, or the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $2,000,000. Therefore, A neither realizes nor recognizes any gain or loss on the sale of the PRS interest to D. D's basis in the PRS interest is $3,000,000. D's share of the adjusted basis of partnership property, as determined under Sec. 1.743-1(d), equals D's interest in the partnership's previously taxed capital of $2,000,000 (the amount of cash that D would receive on a liquidation of the partnership, $3,000,000, increased by the amount of tax loss that would be allocated to D in the hypothetical transaction, $0, and reduced by the amount of tax gain that would be allocated to D in the hypothetical transaction, $1,000,000). Therefore, the positive basis adjustment under section 743(b) is $1,000,000.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.003</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Satisfaction of Sec. 1.752-7 liability. Neither PRS nor any of its partners is entitled to a deduction, loss, or capital expense upon the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability ($2,000,000). PRS is entitled to a deduction, however, for the amount by which the cost of satisfying the Sec. 1.752-7 liability exceeds the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability. Therefore, in 2007, PRS may deduct $1,000,000 (cost to satisfy the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $3,000,000, less the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $2,000,000). If PRS notifies A of the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, then A is entitled to an ordinary deduction in 2007 of $1,000,000 (the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction).[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.004</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that, at the time of A's sale of the PRS interest to D, PRS has a nonrecourse liability of $4,000,000, of which A's share is $1,000,000. A's basis in PRS is $5,000,000. At the time of the sale of the PRS interest to D, the adjusted value of A's interest is $4,000,000 (the fair market value of the interest ($3,000,000), increased by A's share of partnership liabilities ($1,000,000)). The difference between the basis of A's interest ($5,000,000) and the adjusted value of that interest ($4,000,000) is $1,000,000. Therefore, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is $1,000,000 (the lesser of this difference or the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $2,000,000). Immediately before the sale of the PRS interest to D, A's basis is reduced from $5,000,000 to $4,0000,000. A's amount realized on the sale of the PRS interest to D is $4,000,000 ($3,000,000 paid by D, increased under section 752(d) by A's share of partnership liabilities, or $1,000,000). Therefore, A neither realizes nor recognizes any gain or loss on the sale. D's basis in the PRS interest is $4,000,000. Because D's share of the adjusted basis of partnership property is $3,000,000 (D's share of the partnership's previously taxed capital, $2,000,000, plus D's share of partnership liabilities, $1,000,000), the basis adjustment under section 743(b) is $1,000,000.

The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability would have given rise to a capital expense to A or PRS. Neither PRS nor any of its partners are entitled to a capital expense upon the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability ($2,000,000). PRS may, however, increase the basis of appropriate partnership assets by the amount by which the cost of satisfying the Sec. 1.752-7 liability exceeds the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability. Therefore, in 2007, PRS may capitalize $1,000,000 (cost to satisfy the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $3,000,000, less the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, $2,000,000) to the appropriate partnership assets. If A is notified by PRS that the Sec. 1.752-7 liability has been satisfied, then A is entitled to a capital loss in 2007 as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the year of the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for nonrecognition transactions--(i) In general.

The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2004, X contributes undeveloped land with a value and basis of $2,000,000 and subject to environmental liabilities of $1,500,000 to partnership LTP in exchange for a 50% interest in LTP. LTP develops the land as a landfill. In 2005, in a transaction governed by section 721(a), X contributes the LTP interest to UTP in exchange for a 50% interest in UTP. In 2008, X sells the UTP interest to A for $500,000. At the time of the sale, X's basis in UTP is $2,000,000, the remaining built-in loss associated with the environmental liability is $1,500,000, and the gross value of UTP's assets is $2,500,000. The environmental liabilities were not assumed by LTP as part of a contribution by X to LTP of a trade or business with which the liabilities were associated. (See paragraph (b)(10)(ii), Example 1 of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Because UTP's basis in the LTP interest is determined by reference to X's basis in the LTP interest, X's contribution of the LTP interest to UTP is exempted from the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, X's contribution of the LTP interest to UTP is treated as a contribution of X's share of the assets of LTP and UTP's assumption of X's share of the LTP liabilities (including Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities). Therefore, X's transfer of the LTP interest to UTP is a Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer. The Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities deemed transferred by X to UTP are not associated with a trade or business transferred to UTP for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, because they were not associated with a trade or business transferred by X to LTP as part of the original Sec. 1.752-7 liability transfer. See paragraph (j)(2) of this section. Because none of the exceptions described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to X's taxable sale of the UTP interest to A in 2008, paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies to that sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Transfer of partnership interest to corporation. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, rather than transferring the LTP interest to UTP in 2005, X contributes the LTP interest to Corporation Y in an exchange to which section 351 applies. Because Corporation Y's basis in the LTP interest is determined by reference to X's basis in that interest, X's contribution of the LTP interest is exempted from the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. But see section 358(h) and Sec. 1.358-7 for appropriate basis adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2004, A, B, C, and D form equal partnership PRS1. A contributes Blackacre with a value and basis of $2,000,000 to PRS1 and PRS1 assumes from A $1,500,000 of pension liabilities unrelated to Blackacre. B, C, and D each contribute $500,000 cash to PRS1. PRS1 uses the cash contributed by B, C, and D ($1,500,000) to purchase Whiteacre. In 2006, PRS1 merges into PRS2 in an assets-over merger under Sec. 1.708-1(c)(3). Assume that, under Sec. 1.708-1(c), PRS2 is the surviving partnership and PRS1 is the terminating partnership. At the time of the merger, the value of Blackacre is still $2,000,000, the remaining built-in loss with respect to the pension liabilities is still $1,500,000, but the value of Whiteacre has declined to $500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed assumption by PRS2 of PRS1 liabilities. Under Sec. 1.708-1(c)(3), the merger is treated as a contribution of the assets and liabilities of PRS1 to PRS2, followed by a distribution of the PRS2 interests by PRS1 in liquidation of PRS1. Because PRS2 assumes a Sec. 1.752-7 liability (the pension liabilities) of PRS1, PRS1 is a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of PRS2. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, A is also Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of PRS2 to the extent of the remaining $1,500,000 built-in loss associated with the pension liabilities. B, C, and D are not Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to PRS1. If the amount of the pension liabilities had increased between the date of PRS1's assumption of those liabilities from A and the date of the merger of PRS1 into PRS2, then B, C, and D would be Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to PRS2 to the extent of their respective shares of that increase. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deemed distribution of PRS2 interests. Paragraph (e)(1) does not apply to PRS1's deemed distribution of the PRS2 interests, because, under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, all of the partners that were Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to PRS2 before the distribution, i.e., A, continue to be

Sec. 1.752-7 liability partners after the distribution. After the distribution, A's share of the pension liabilities now held by PRS2 will continue to be $1,500,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Partnership division; no shifting of Sec. 1.752-7 liability. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that PRS1 does not merge with PRS2, but instead contributes Blackacre to PRS2 in exchange for PRS2 interests and the assumption by PRS2 of the pension liabilities. Immediately thereafter, PRS1 distributes the PRS2 interests to A and B in liquidation of their interests in PRS1. The analysis is the same as in Example 3. After the assumption of the pension liabilities by PRS2, A is a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to PRS2. After the distribution of a PRS2 interest to A, A continues to be a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to PRS2, and the amount of A's built-in loss with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities continues to be $1,500,000. Therefore, paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to the distribution of the PRS2 interests to A and B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Partnership division; shifting of Sec. 1.752-7 liability. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that PRS1 distributes the PRS2 interests not to A and B, but to C and D, in liquidation of their interests in PRS1. After this distribution, A does not continue to be a Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner of PRS2, because A no longer has an interest in PRS2. Therefore, paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies to the distribution of the PRS2 interests to C and D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Distribution in liquidation of Sec. 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest--(1) In general.

In 2013, PRS pays $1,000,000 to satisfy the entire Sec. 1.752-7 liability.

Therefore, A's basis in Property 2 under section 732(b) is $3,000,000.

B contributes $3,000,000 cash for a 25% interest in PRS, and C contributes $6,000,000 cash for a 50% interest in PRS. PRS uses the cash contributed to purchase Property 2. In 2007, PRS distributes Property 1, subject to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability to B in liquidation of B's interest in PRS.

The remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability at that time is zero because all of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability as of the time of the assumption of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by the partnership was capitalized by the partnership.

In 2006, A sells A's interest in UTP to D for $3,000,000. At the time of the sale, the basis of A's UTP interest is $5,000,000, the remaining built-in loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability is $2,000,000, and UTP has no liabilities other than the Sec. 1.752-7 liabilities assumed from A.

At the time of the contribution, Property 1 still has a value and basis of $5,000,000 and Property 2 still has a value and basis of $9,000,000. UTP's basis in LTP under section 722 is $14,000,000.

Therefore, the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction is $1,500,000 and UTP's basis in the LTP interest must be reduced to $10,500,000. In addition, UTP's partners must reduce their bases in their UTP interests by their proportionate shares of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability reduction. Thus, the basis of each of B's and D's interest in UTP must be reduced by $375,000 and

the basis of C's interest in UTP must be reduced by $750,000. In 2011, D sells the UTP interest to F.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MY05.017</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deduction, expense, or loss associated with the Sec. 1.752-7 liability by LTP.

Under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, UTP also is not entitled to any deduction with respect to the Sec. 1.752-7 liability. If LTP notifies A, B, C and D of the satisfaction of the Sec. 1.752-7 liability, then A is entitled to a deduction in 2012 of $2,000,000, B and D are each entitled to deductions in 2012 of $375,000, and C is entitled to a deduction in 2012 of $750,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective dates--(1) In general.
