(See 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Review and report to OMB. The Department shall ensure that the following reviews are conducted as often as specified below by each of the components who shall be prepared to report to the Departmental Disclosure Branch upon request the results of such reviews and any corrective action taken to resolve problems uncovered. Each component shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review every two years a random sample of the component's contracts that provide for the maintenance of a system of records on behalf of the component to accomplish a function of the component, in order to ensure that the working of each contract makes the provisions of the Act apply.

civilly liable under section (g) of the Act, or an employee being found criminally liable under the provisions of section (i) of the Act, in order to determine the extent of the problem and to prevent future recurrences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Review annually each system of records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system. Where minor changes are needed, publish an amended notice in the Federal Register. Minor changes shall be consolidated in one annual comprehensive publication. The term ``minor change to a system of records'' means a change that does not significantly change the system. More specifically, a minor change does not affect the character or purpose of the system and does not affect the ability of an individual to gain access to a record about the individual or to any information pertaining to such individual which is contained in the system; for example, changing the title of the system manager or the location of the system.</p>
