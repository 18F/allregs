                                Sec. 81.75  Proprietary information withheld by order or regulation.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Secretarial determination of proprietary classification.  Following a determination by the Secretary that mortgage data or AHAR  information are proprietary information under FHEFSSA, the Secretary  shall expeditiously issue a temporary order, final order, or regulation  withholding the mortgage data or AHAR information from the public-use  database and from public disclosure by HUD in accordance with 12 U.S.C.  4546. The Secretary may, from time to time, by regulation or order,  issue a list providing that certain mortgage data or AHAR information  shall be treated as proprietary information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modification of proprietary classification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The  Secretary may, based upon a consideration of the factors in Sec.  81.74(b), modify a previous determination that mortgage data or AHAR  information are proprietary information (and may also make conforming  changes to the list designating certain mortgage data or AHAR  information as proprietary information) by regulation, or by order using  the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Release of data following a modification of proprietary  classification. Following the Secretary's determination under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section to modify a previous proprietary determination by  reclassifying certain mortgage data as non-proprietary, the Secretary  shall release the reclassified, non-proprietary mortgage data to the  public both prospectively and for all prior years' public use databases,  unless otherwise provided by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Release of aged data. The Secretary may determine, through case- by-case consideration of individual data elements under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, that certain mortgage data previously determined to be  proprietary may lose their proprietary status if they are at least five  years old (as measured from the end of the calendar year to which the  mortgage data pertain). The Secretary will evaluate the age of the data  as one of the relevant factors that may be considered under 24 CFR  81.74(b)(6). If the Secretary determines that such aged mortgage data  have lost their proprietary status, these data shall be released  publicly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Release of aggregated data derived from proprietary loan-level  data. The Secretary may, based upon a consideration of the factors in  Sec. 81.74(b) and using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this  section, determine that certain aggregated data derived from proprietary  loan-level mortgage data are not proprietary. If the Secretary makes  such a determination, then the aggregated data shall be released to the  public both prospectively and for all prior years, unless otherwise  provided by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures. The following procedures apply to the Secretary's  issuance of an order in connection with a determination under paragraph  (b)(1) or (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary shall provide each GSE with written notice of the  mortgage data, AHAR information or aggregated data proposed to be  released, and an opportunity to submit written comments. The Secretary  may also provide each GSE with an opportunity for a meeting with HUD to  discuss the proposed release of mortgage data, AHAR information, or  aggregated data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary shall make a determination regarding the proposed  release of the GSE mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data  based upon a consideration of the data or information under the  standards set forth in 24 CFR 81.74(b) and the GSEs' written and oral  objections, if any, to the proposed release of such mortgage data, AHAR  information, or aggregated data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary shall provide notice in writing to each GSE of the  Secretary's determination and the reasons under Sec. 81.74(b) for his  or her determination. If the Secretary determines that the mortgage  data, AHAR information, or aggregated data may be released, the notice  will also provide that the Secretary shall not release the mortgage  data, AHAR information, or aggregated data to the public for 10 working  days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary shall, no earlier than the end of the ten-working- day period referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, publish an  order in the   Federal Register notifying the public of the Secretary's determination  to release the mortgage data or AHAR information that has been  reclassified as non-proprietary and/or to release certain non- proprietary aggregations of data derived from proprietary loan-level  mortgage data. The order will also modify the list described in  paragraph (a) of this section to reflect the Secretary's  reclassification of the mortgage data or AHAR information. The Secretary  shall omit from the published order any information that would reveal  proprietary information.  [70 FR 69031, Nov. 10, 2005]</p>
