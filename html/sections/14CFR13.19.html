                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C.  1429), the Administrator may reinspect any civil aircraft, aircraft  engine, propeller, appliance, air navigation facility, or air agency,  and may re-examine any civil airman. Under section 501(e) of the FA Act,  any Certificate of Aircraft Registration may be suspended or revoked by  the Administrator for any cause that renders the aircraft ineligible for  registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, as a result of such a reinspection re-examination, or other  investigation made by the Administrator under section 609 of the FA Act,  the Administrator determines that the public interest and safety in air  commerce requires it, the Administrator may issue an order amending,  suspending, or revoking, all or part of any type certificate, production  certificate, airworthiness certificate, airman certificate, air carrier  operating certificate, air navigation facility certificate, or air  agency certificate. This authority may be exercised for remedial  purposes in cases involving the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act  (49 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) or regulations issued under that Act. This  authority is also exercised by the Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief  Counsel, Enforcement, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Regulations, the  Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office,  each Regional Counsel, and the Aeronautical Center Counsel. If the  Administrator finds that any aircraft registered under Part 47 of this  chapter is ineligible for registration, the Administrator issues an  order suspending or revoking that certificate. This authority as to  aircraft found ineligible for registration is also exercised by each  Regional Counsel, the Aeronautical Center Counsel, and the Assistant  Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before issuing an order under paragraph (b) of this section, the  Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Enforcement, the Assistant  Chief Counsel, Regulations, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa,  and Middle East Area Office, each Regional Counsel, or the Aeronautical  Center Counsel advises the certificate holder of the charges or other  reasons upon which the Administrator bases the proposed action and,  except in an emergency, allows the holder to answer any charges and to  be heard as to why the certificate should not be amended, suspended, or  revoked. The holder may, by checking the appropriate box on the form  that is sent to the holder with the notice of proposed certificate  action, elect to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Admit the charges and surrender his or her certificate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Answer the charges in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request that an order be issued in accordance with the notice of  proposed certificate action so that the certificate holder may appeal to  the National Transportation Safety Board, if the charges concerning a  matter under Title VI of the FA Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Request an opportunity to be heard in an informal conference  with the FAA counsel; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Request a hearing in accordance with Subpart D of this part if  the charges concern a matter under Title V of the FA Act.  Except as provided in Sec. 13.35(b), unless the certificate holder  returns the form and, where required, an answer or motion, with a  postmark of not later than 15 days after the date of receipt of the  notice, the order of the Administrator is issued as proposed. If the  certificate holder has requested an informal conference with the FAA  counsel and the charges concern a matter under Title V of the FA Act,  the holder may after that conference also request a formal hearing in  writing with a postmark of not later than 10 days after the close of the  conference. After considering any information submitted by the  certificate holder, the Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel for  Regulations and Enforcement, the Regional Counsel concerned, or the  Aeronautical Center Counsel (as to matters under Title V of the FA Act)  issues the order of the Administrator, except that if the holder has  made a valid request for a formal hearing on a matter under Title V of  the FA Act initially or after an informal conference, Subpart D of this  part governs further proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person whose certificate is affected by an order issued  under this section may appeal to the National Transportation Safety  Board. If the certificate holder files an appeal with the Board, the  Administrator's order is stayed unless the Administrator advises the  Board that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce requires that  the order become effective immediately. If the Board is so advised, the  order remains effective and the Board shall finally dispose of the  appeal within 60 days after the date of the advice. This paragraph does  not apply to any person whose Certificate of Aircraft Registration is  affected by an order issued under this section.  [Doc.
