                            <p class="depth0">A drawing depicts the mark sought to be registered. The drawing must  show only one mark. The applicant must include a clear drawing of the  mark when the application is filed. There are two types of drawings:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard character (typed) drawing. Applicants who seek to  register words, letters, numbers, or any combination thereof without  claim to any particular font style, size, or color must submit a  standard character drawing that shows the mark in black on a white  background. An applicant may submit a standard character drawing if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application includes a statement that the mark is in  standard characters and no claim is made to any particular font style,  size, or color;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mark does not include a design element;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All letters and words in the mark are depicted in Latin  characters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All numerals in the mark are depicted in Roman or Arabic  numerals; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The mark includes only common punctuation or diacritical marks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special form drawing. Applicants who seek to register a mark  that includes a two or three-dimensional design; color; and/or words,  letters, or numbers or the combination thereof in a particular font  style or size must submit a special form drawing. The drawing should  show the mark in black on a white background, unless the mark includes  color.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Marks that include color. If the mark includes color, the  drawing must show the mark in color, and the applicant must name the  color(s), describe where the color(s) appear on the mark, and submit a  claim that the color(s) is a feature of the mark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three dimensional marks. If the mark has three-dimensional  features, the drawing must depict a single rendition of the mark, and  the applicant must indicate that the mark is three-dimensional.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Motion marks. If the mark has motion, the drawing may depict a  single point in the movement, or the drawing may depict up to five  freeze frames showing various points in the movement, whichever best  depicts the commercial impression of the mark. The applicant must also  describe the mark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Broken lines to show placement. If necessary to adequately  depict the commercial impression of the mark,   the applicant may be required to submit a drawing that shows the  placement of the mark by surrounding the mark with a proportionately  accurate broken-line representation of the particular goods, packaging,  or advertising on which the mark appears. The applicant must also use  broken lines to show any other matter not claimed as part of the mark.  For any drawing using broken lines to indicate placement of the mark, or  matter not claimed as part of the mark, the applicant must describe the  mark and explain the purpose of the broken lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Description of mark. A description of the mark must be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TEAS drawings. A drawing filed through TEAS must meet the  requirements of Sec.  2.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Paper drawings. A paper drawing must meet the requirements of  Sec.  2.54.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sound, scent, and non-visual marks. An applicant is not required  to submit a drawing if the mark consists only of a sound, a scent, or  other completely non-visual matter. For these types of marks, the  applicant must submit a detailed description of the mark.  [68 FR 55763, Sept. 26, 2003, as amended at 73 FR 13784, Mar. 14, 2008;  73 FR 67769, Nov. 17, 2008]</p>
