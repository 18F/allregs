                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. Include applicable non- deterioration adjustments such as a Green Engine Factor or regeneration  adjustment factor. Round the results to one more decimal place than the  applicable emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you conduct multiple tests on any locomotives, calculate  final test results by summing the initial test results derived in  paragraph (a) of this section for each test locomotive, dividing by the  number of tests conducted on the locomotive, and rounding to one more  decimal place than the applicable emission standard. For catalyst- equipped locomotives, you may ask us   to allow you to exclude an initial failed test if all of the following  are true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The catalyst was in a green condition when tested initially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The locomotive met all emission standards when retested after  degreening the catalyst.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No additional emission-related maintenance or repair was  performed between the initial failed test and the subsequent passing  test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculate the final test results for each test locomotive by  applying the appropriate deterioration factors, derived in the  certification process for the engine family, to the final test results,  and rounding to one more decimal place than the applicable emission  standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, subsequent to an initial failure of a production line test,  the average of the test results for the failed locomotive and the two  additional locomotives tested, is greater than any applicable emission  standard or FEL, the engine family is deemed to be in non-compliance  with applicable emission standards, and you must notify us within ten  working days of such noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within 45 calendar days of the end of each quarter, you must  send to the Designated Compliance Officer a report with the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of the emission test facilities  which you used to conduct your testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total production and sample size for each engine family tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicable standards against which each engine family was  tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each test conducted, include all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the test locomotive, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration and engine family identification.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make, and build date.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engine identification number.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Number of megawatt-hours (or miles if applicable) of service  accumulated on locomotive prior to testing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Description of Green Engine Factor; how it is determined and how  it is applied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Location(s) where service accumulation was conducted and  description of accumulation procedure and schedule, if applicable. If  the locomotive was introduced into service between assembly and testing,  you are only required to summarize the service accumulation, rather than  identifying specific locations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Test number, date, test procedure used, initial test results  before and after rounding, and final test results for all production  line emission tests conducted, whether valid or invalid, and the reason  for invalidation of any test results, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A complete description of any adjustment, modification, repair,  preparation, maintenance, and testing which was performed on the test  locomotive, has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of  this subpart, and will not be performed on other production locomotives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other information we may ask you to add to your written  report so we can determine whether your new engines conform with the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For each failed locomotive as defined in Sec.  1033.330(a), a  description of the remedy and test results for all retests as required  by Sec.  1033.340(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The following signed statement and endorsement by an authorized  representative of your company:</p><p class="depth3">We submit this report under sections 208 and 213 of the Clean Air  Act. Our production-line testing conformed completely with the  requirements of 40 CFR part 1033. We have not changed production  processes or quality-control procedures for the test locomotives in a  way that might affect emission controls. All the information in this  report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I know of the  penalties for violating the Clean Air Act and the regulations.
