                            <p class="depth0">A district director, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for  Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs  may permit an alien ordered removed (including an alien ordered excluded  or deported in proceedings prior to April 1, 1997) to depart at his or  her own expense to a destination of his or her own choice. Any alien who  has departed from the United States while an order of deportation or  removal is outstanding shall be considered to have been deported,  excluded and deported, or removed, except that an alien who departed  before the expiration of the voluntary departure period granted in  connection with an alternate order of deportation or removal shall not  be considered to be so deported or removed.
