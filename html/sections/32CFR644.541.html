                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opening of bids. All bids shall be opened and publicly disclosed  by a duly authorized representative of the responsible DE at the time  and place   stated in the Invitation and advertisements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Award and notice to bidders. Award shall be made with reasonable  promptness by notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to  the Invitation for Bids, will be most advantageous to the Government,  price and other factors considered, provided that any or all bids may be  rejected when it is in the public interest to do so. When an award is  made, unsuccessful bidders should be notified promptly and their earnest  money deposits returned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equal offers. Equal offers mean two or more offers that are  equal in all respects taking into consideration the best interests of  the Government. When equal acceptable offers are received, award shall  be made by a drawing by lot limited to the equal acceptable offers  received (See also Sec. 644.542.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public auction. When authorized by GSA, sales of surplus  property may be made through contract auctioneers. Consideration should  be given to auction sales when there is likely to be considerable  interest in the property. GSA Regional Offices have had experience with  actions, maintain lists of qualified auctioneers, are in a position to  give other advice and assistance, and may authorize auction sales on  behalf of GSA, pursuant to FPMR 101-47.304-7. Auctioneers retained under  contract shall be required to publicly advertise for bids in accordance  with applicable provisions of that regulation. The prior approval of  DAEN-REM will be obtained before auction sales are undertaken.</p>
