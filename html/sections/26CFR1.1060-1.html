                                Sec. 1.1060-1  Special allocation rules for certain asset acquisitions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope--(1) In general. This section prescribes rules relating to  the requirements of section 1060, which, in the case of an applicable  asset acquisition, requires the transferor (the seller) and the  transferee (the purchaser) each to allocate the consideration paid or  received in the transaction among the assets transferred in the same  manner as amounts are allocated under section 338(b)(5) (relating to the  allocation of adjusted grossed-up basis among the assets of the target  corporation when a section 338 election is made). In the case of an  applicable asset acquisition described in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section, sellers and purchasers must allocate the consideration under  the residual method as described in Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in  order to determine, respectively, the amount realized from, and the  basis in, each of the transferred assets. For rules relating to  distributions of partnership property or transfers of partnership  interests which are subject to section 1060(d), see Sec. 1.755-2T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The provisions of this section  apply to any asset acquisition occurring after March 15, 2001. However,  paragraphs (b)(9) and (c)(5) of this section apply only to applicable  asset acquisitions occurring on or after April 10, 2006. A purchaser or  a seller may make an irrevocable election to apply the rules in  Sec. Sec. 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in Sec. Sec.  1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an applicable asset  acquisition occurring before April 10, 2006. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of  this section describes the time and manner of the election for the  purchaser and paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section prescribes the time  and manner of the election for the seller. The seller may make the  election to apply the regulations retroactively without regard to  whether the purchaser also makes the election. For rules applicable to  asset acquisitions on or before March 15, 2001, see Sec. 1.1060-1T in  effect before March 16, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time and manner of making the election for the purchaser. The  purchaser may make an election described in this paragraph (a)(2) by  attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for  the taxable year that includes the applicable asset sale. The statement  must be entitled ``Election to Retroactively Apply the Rules in Sec.  1.338-11 (Including the Applicable Provisions in Sec. Sec. 1.197- 2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an Applicable Asset  Acquisition Completed Before April 10, 2006'' and must include the  following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and E.I.N. for the purchaser; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The following declaration (or a substantially similar  declaration): The purchaser has amended its income tax returns for the  taxable year that includes the applicable asset acquisition and for all  affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in Sec. 1.338-11  (Including the Applicable Provisions in Sec. Sec. 1.197-2(g)(5),  1.381(c)(22)-1,846 and 1060).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Time and manner of making the election for the seller. The  seller may make an election described in this paragraph (a)(2) by  attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for  the taxable year that includes the applicable asset sale. The statement  must be entitled ``Election to retroactively apply the rules in Sec.  1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in Sec. Sec. 1.197- 2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an applicable asset  acquisition completed before April 10, 2006'' and must include the  following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and E.I.N. for the seller; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The following declaration (or a substantially similar  declaration): The seller has amended its income tax returns for the  taxable year that includes the applicable asset acquisition and for all  affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in Sec. 1.338-11  (including the applicable provisions in Sec.

(C) Election described in Sec. 1.338-6(c)(5). (2) Transfers of interests in partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable asset acquisition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An applicable  asset acquisition is any transfer, whether direct or indirect, of a  group of assets if the assets transferred constitute a trade or business  in the hands of either the seller or the purchaser and, except as  provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the purchaser's basis in  the transferred assets is determined wholly by reference to the  purchaser's consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assets constituting a trade or business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of this section, a group of assets constitutes a trade or  business if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The use of such assets would constitute an active trade or  business under section 355; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Its character is such that goodwill or going concern value could  under any circumstances attach to such group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Goodwill or going concern value. Goodwill is the value of a  trade or business attributable to the expectancy of continued customer  patronage. This expectancy may be due to the name or reputation of a  trade or business or any other factor. Going concern value is the  additional value that attaches to property because of its existence as  an integral part of an ongoing business activity. Going concern value  includes the value attributable to the ability of a trade or business  (or a part of a trade or business) to continue functioning or generating  income without interruption notwithstanding a change in ownership. It  also includes the value that is attributable to the immediate use or  availability of an acquired trade or business, such as, for example, the  use of the revenues or net earnings that otherwise would not be received  during any period if the acquired trade or business were not available  or operational.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Factors indicating goodwill or going concern value. In making  the determination in this paragraph (b)(2), all the facts and  circumstances surrounding the transaction are taken into account.  Whether sufficient consideration is available to allocate to goodwill or  going concern value after the residual method is applied is not relevant  in determining whether goodwill or going concern value could attach to a  group of assets. Factors to be considered include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The presence of any intangible assets (whether or not those  assets are section 197 intangibles), provided, however, that the  transfer of such an asset in the absence of other assets will not be a  trade or business for purposes of section 1060;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The existence of an excess of the total consideration over the  aggregate book value of the tangible and intangible assets purchased  (other than goodwill and going concern value) as shown in the financial  accounting books and records of the purchaser; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Related transactions, including lease agreements, licenses, or  other similar agreements between the purchaser and seller (or managers,  directors, owners, or employees of the seller) in connection with the  transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate paragraphs (b)(1)  and (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. S is a high grade machine shop that manufactures  microwave connectors in limited quantities. It is a successful company  with a reputation within the industry and among its customers for  manufacturing unique, high quality products. Its tangible assets consist  primarily of ordinary machinery for working metal and plating. It has no  secret formulas or patented drawings of value. P is a company that  designs, manufactures, and markets electronic components. It wants to  establish an immediate presence in the microwave industry, an area in  which it   previously has not been engaged. P is acquiring assets of a number of  smaller companies and hopes that these assets will collectively allow it  to offer a broad product mix. P acquires the assets of S in order to  augment its product mix and to promote its presence in the microwave  industry. P will not use the assets acquired from S to manufacture  microwave connectors. The assets transferred are assets that constitute  a trade or business in the hands of the seller. Thus, P's purchase of  S's assets is an applicable asset acquisition. The fact that P will not  use the assets acquired from S to continue the business of S does not  affect this conclusion.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. S, a sole proprietor who operates a car wash, both leases  the building housing the car wash and sells all of the car wash  equipment to P. S's use of the building and the car wash equipment  constitute a trade or business. P begins operating a car wash in the  building it leases from S. Because the assets transferred together with  the asset leased are assets which constitute a trade or business, P's  purchase of S's assets is an applicable asset acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. S, a corporation, owns a retail store business in State X  and conducts activities in connection with that business enterprise that  meet the active trade or business requirement of section 355. P is a  minority shareholder of S. S distributes to P all the assets of S used  in S's retail business in State X in complete redemption of P's stock in  S held by P. The distribution of S's assets in redemption of P's stock  is treated as a sale or exchange under sections 302(a) and 302(b)(3),  and P's basis in the assets distributed to it is determined wholly by  reference to the consideration paid, the S stock. Thus, S's distribution  of assets constituting a trade or business to P is an applicable asset  acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. S is a manufacturing company with an internal financial  bookkeeping department. P is in the business of providing a financial  bookkeeping service on a contract basis. As part of an agreement for P  to begin providing financial bookkeeping services to S, P agrees to buy  all of the assets associated with S's internal bookkeeping operations  and provide employment to any of S's bookkeeping department employees  who choose to accept a position with P. In addition to selling P the  assets associated with its bookkeeping operation, S will enter into a  long term contract with P for bookkeeping services. Because assets  transferred from S to P, along with the related contract for bookkeeping  services, are a trade or business in the hands of P, the sale of the  bookkeeping assets from S to P is an applicable asset acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Asymmetrical transfers of assets. A purchaser is subject to  section 1060 if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under general principles of tax law, the seller is not treated  as transferring the same assets as the purchaser is treated as  acquiring;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The assets acquired by the purchaser constitute a trade or  business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the  purchaser's basis in the transferred assets is determined wholly by  reference to the purchaser's consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Related transactions. Whether the assets transferred constitute  a trade or business is determined by aggregating all transfers from the  seller to the purchaser in a series of related transactions. Except as  provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, all assets transferred  from the seller to the purchaser in a series of related transactions are  included in the group of assets among which the consideration paid or  received in such series is allocated under the residual method. The  principles of Sec. 1.338-1(c) are also applied in determining which  assets are included in the group of assets among which the consideration  paid or received is allocated under the residual method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> More than a single trade or business. If the assets transferred  from a seller to a purchaser include more than one trade or business,  then, in applying this section, all of the assets transferred (whether  or not transferred in one transaction or a series of related  transactions and whether or not part of a trade or business) are treated  as a single trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Covenant entered into by the seller. If, in connection with an  applicable asset acquisition, the seller enters into a covenant (e.g., a  covenant not to compete) with the purchaser, that covenant is treated as  an asset transferred as part of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Partial non-recognition exchanges. A transfer may constitute an  applicable asset acquisition notwithstanding the fact that no gain or  loss is recognized with respect to a portion of the group of assets  transferred. All of the assets transferred, including the non- recognition assets, are taken into account in determining whether the  group of assets constitutes a trade or   business. The allocation of consideration under paragraph (c) of this  section is done without taking into account either the non-recognition  assets or the amount of money or other property that is treated as  transferred in exchange for the non-recognition assets (together, the  non-recognition exchange property). The basis in and gain or loss  recognized with respect to the non-recognition exchange property are  determined under such rules as would otherwise apply to an exchange of  such property. The amount of the money and other property treated as  exchanged for non-recognition assets is the amount by which the fair  market value of the non-recognition assets transferred by one party  exceeds the fair market value of the non-recognition assets transferred  by the other (to the extent of the money and the fair market value of  property transferred in the exchange). The money and other property that  are treated as transferred in exchange for the non-recognition assets  (and which are not included among the assets to which section 1060  applies) are considered to come from the following assets in the  following order: first from Class I assets, then from Class II assets,  then from Class III assets, then from Class IV assets, then from Class V  assets, then from Class VI assets, and then from Class VII assets. For  this purpose, liabilities assumed (or to which a non-recognition  exchange property is subject) are treated as Class I assets. See Example  1 in paragraph (d) of this section for an example of the application of  section 1060 to a single transaction which is, in part, a non- recognition exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Insurance business. The mere reinsurance of insurance contracts  by an insurance company is not an applicable asset acquisition, even if  it enables the reinsurer to establish a customer relationship with the  owners of the reinsured contracts. However, a transfer of an insurance  business is an applicable asset acquisition if the purchaser acquires  significant business assets, in addition to insurance contracts, to  which goodwill and going concern value could attach. For rules regarding  the treatment of an applicable asset acquisition of an insurance  business, see paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of consideration among assets under the residual  method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consideration. The seller's consideration is the amount, in  the aggregate, realized from selling the assets in the applicable asset  acquisition under section 1001(b). The purchaser's consideration is the  amount, in the aggregate, of its cost of purchasing the assets in the  applicable asset acquisition that is properly taken into account in  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of consideration among assets. For purposes of  determining the seller's amount realized for each of the assets sold in  an applicable asset acquisition, the seller allocates consideration to  all the assets sold by using the residual method under Sec. Sec. 1.338- 6 and 1.338-7, substituting consideration for ADSP. For purposes of  determining the purchaser's basis in each of the assets purchased in an  applicable asset acquisition, the purchaser allocates consideration to  all the assets purchased by using the residual method under Sec. Sec.  1.338-6 and 1.338-7, substituting consideration for AGUB. In allocating  consideration, the rules set forth in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this  section apply in addition to the rules in Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338- 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>  shall be made as if such election had not been made. The preceding  sentence applies to applicable   asset acquisitions occurring on or after September 11, 2007. For  applicable asset acquisitions occurring before September 11, 2007, and  on or after September 15, 2004, see Sec. 1.1060-1T as contained in 26  CFR Part 1 in effect on April 1, 2007. For applicable asset acquisitions  occurring before September 15, 2004, see Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.1060-1  as contained in 26 CFR Part 1 in effect on April 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> does not apply if the parties are able to refute the  allocation or valuation under the standards set forth in Commissioner v.  Danielson, 378 F.2d 771 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 858 (1967) (a  party wishing to challenge the tax consequences of an agreement as  construed by the Commissioner must offer proof that, in an action  between the parties to the agreement, would be admissible to alter that  construction or show its unenforceability because of mistake, undue  influence, fraud, duress, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Insurance business. If the trade or business transferred is an  insurance business, the rules of this paragraph (c) are modified by the  principles of Sec. 1.338-11(a) through (d). However, in transactions  governed by section 1060, such principles apply even if the transfer of  the trade or business is effected in whole or in part through indemnity  reinsurance rather than assumption reinsurance, and, for the insurer or  reinsurer, an insurance contract (including an annuity or reinsurance  contract) is a Class VI asset regardless of whether it is a section 197  intangible. In addition, the principles of Sec. 1.338-11(f) through (h)  apply if the transfer occurs in connection with the complete liquidation  of the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2001, A transfers assets X, Y, and Z to  B in exchange for assets D, E, and F plus $1,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume the exchange of assets constitutes an exchange of like- kind property to which section 1031 applies. Assume also that goodwill  or going concern value could under any circumstances attach to each of  the DEF and XYZ groups of assets and, therefore, each group constitutes  a trade or business under section 1060.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the fair market values of the assets and the amount of  money transferred are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair</p><p class="depth0">Asset                               market</p><p class="depth0">value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ By A:</p><p class="depth0">X...........................................................     $ 400</p><p class="depth0">Y...........................................................       400</p><p class="depth0">Z...........................................................       200</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total.....................................................     1,000</p><p class="depth0">========= By B:</p><p class="depth0">D...........................................................        40</p><p class="depth0">E...........................................................        30</p><p class="depth0">F...........................................................        30</p><p class="depth0">Cash (amount)...............................................     1,000</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total.....................................................     1,100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, for purposes of  allocating consideration under paragraph (c) of this section, the like- kind assets exchanged and any money or other property that are treated  as transferred in exchange for the like-kind property are excluded from  the application of section 1060.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Since assets X, Y, and Z are like-kind property, they are  excluded from the application of the section 1060 allocation rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Since assets D, E, and F are like-kind property, they are  excluded from the application of the section 1060 allocation rules.  Thus, the allocation rules of section 1060 do not apply in determining  B's gain or loss with respect to the disposition of assets D, E, and F,  and the allocation rules of section 1060 and paragraph (c) of this  section are not applied to determine A's bases of assets D, E, and F. In  addition, $900 of the $1,000 cash B gave to A for A's like-kind assets  (X, Y, and Z) is treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kind  property in order to equalize the fair market values of the like-kind  assets. Therefore, $900 of the cash is excluded from the application of  the section 1060 allocation rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> $100 of the cash is allocated under section 1060 and paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A received $100 that must be allocated under section 1060 and  paragraph (c) of this section. Since A transferred no Class I, II, III,  IV, V, or VI assets to which section 1060 applies, in determining its  amount realized for the part of the exchange to which   section 1031 does not apply, the $100 is allocated to Class VII assets  (goodwill and going concern value).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> B gave A $100 that must be allocated under section 1060 and  paragraph (c) of this section. Since B received from A no Class I, II,  III, IV, V, or VI assets to which section 1060 applies, the $100  consideration is allocated by B to Class VII assets (goodwill and going  concern value).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2001, S, a sole proprietor, sells to P,  a corporation, a group of assets that constitutes a trade or business  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. S, who plans to retire  immediately, also executes in P's favor a covenant not to compete. P  pays S $3,000 in cash and assumes $1,000 in liabilities. Thus, the total  consideration is $4,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the purchase date, P and S also execute a separate agreement  that states that the fair market values of the Class II, Class III,  Class V, and Class VI assets S sold to P are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair</p><p class="depth0">Asset class                        Asset                 market</p><p class="depth0">value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ II.........................

Assume that the  Commissioner correctly determines that the fair market value of the  covenant not to compete was $500. Since the allocation of consideration  among Class II, III, V, and VI assets results in allocation up to the  fair market value limitation, the $600 of unallocated consideration  resulting from the Commissioner's redetermination of the value of the  covenant not to compete is allocated to Class VII assets (goodwill and  going concern value).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable asset acquisitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. Unless otherwise excluded from this requirement by the  Commissioner, the seller and the purchaser in an applicable asset  acquisition each must report information concerning the amount of  consideration in the transaction and its allocation among the assets  transferred. They also must report information concerning subsequent  adjustments to consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time and manner of reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The seller and  the purchaser each must file asset acquisition statements on Form 8594,  ``Asset Allocation Statement,'' with their income tax returns or returns  of income for the taxable year that includes the first date assets are  sold pursuant to an applicable asset acquisition. This reporting  requirement applies to all asset acquisitions described in this section.  For reporting requirements relating to asset acquisitions occurring  before March 16, 2001, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,  see the temporary regulations under section 1060 in effect prior to  March 16, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional reporting requirement. When an increase or decrease  in consideration is taken into account after the close of the first  taxable year that includes the first date assets are sold in an  applicable asset acquisition, the seller and the purchaser each must  file a supplemental asset acquisition statement on Form 8594 with the  income tax return or return of income for the taxable year in which the  increase (or decrease) is properly taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Election described in Sec. 1.338-6(c)(5)--(1) Availability. The  election described in Sec. 1.338-6(c)(5) is available in respect of an  applicable asset acquisition provided that the requirements of that  section are satisfied. Such election may be made by the seller,  regardless of whether the purchaser also makes the election, and may be  made by the purchaser, regardless of whether the seller also makes the  election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election described in  Sec. 1.338-6(c)(5)   is made by taking a position on a timely filed original tax return for  the taxable year of the applicable asset acquisition that is consistent  with having made the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Irrevocability of election.
