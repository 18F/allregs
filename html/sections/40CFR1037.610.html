                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may ask us to apply the provisions of this section for CO2 emission reductions resulting from vehicle technologies that were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles before model year 2010 that are not reflected in the GEM simulation tool. These provisions may be applied for CO2 emission reductions reflected using the specified test procedures, provided they are not reflected in the GEM. We will apply these provisions only for technologies that will result in measurable, demonstrable, and verifiable real-world CO2 emission reductions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this section may be applied as either an improvement factor or as a separate credit, consistent with good engineering judgment. We recommend that you base your credit/adjustment on A to B testing of pairs of vehicles differing only with respect to the technology in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate improvement factors as the ratio of in-use emissions with the technology divided by the in-use emissions without the technology. Use the improvement-factor approach where good engineering judgment indicates that the actual benefit will be proportional to emissions measured over the test procedures specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate separate credits (g/ton-mile) based on the difference between the in-use emission rate with the technology and the in-use emission rate without the technology. Multiply this difference by the number of vehicles, standard payload, and useful life. Use the separate-credit approach where good engineering judgment indicates that the actual benefit will be not be proportional to emissions measured over the test procedures specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We may require you to discount or otherwise adjust your improvement factor or credit to account for uncertainty or other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may perform A to B testing by measuring emissions from the vehicles during chassis testing or from in-use on-road testing. We recommend that you perform on-road testing according to SAE J1321 Joint TMC/SAE Fuel Consumption Test Procedure Type II Reaffirmed 1986-10 or SAE J1526 Joint TMC/SAE Fuel Consumption In-Service Test Procedure Type III Issued 1987-06 (see Sec.  1037.810 for information availability of SAE standards), subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum route distance is 100 miles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The route selected must be representative in terms of grade. We will take into account published and relevant research in determining whether the grade is representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The vehicle speed over the route must be representative of the drive-cycle weighting adopted for each regulatory subcategory. For example, if the route selected for an evaluation of a combination tractor with a sleeper cab contains only interstate driving, the improvement factor would apply only to 86 percent of the weighted result.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ambient air temperature must be between 5 and 35 [deg]C, unless the technology requires other temperatures for demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We may allow you to use a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) device for measuring CO2 emissions during the on-road testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Send your request to the Designated Compliance Officer. Include a detailed description of the technology and a recommended test plan. Also state whether you recommend applying these provisions using the improvement-factor method or the separate-credit method. We recommend that you do not begin collecting test data (for submission to EPA) before contacting us. For technologies for which the engine manufacturer could also claim credits (such as transmissions in certain circumstances), we may require you to include a letter from the engine manufacturer stating that it will not seek credits for the same technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may seek public comment on your request, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 86.1866. However, we will generally not seek public comment on credits or adjustments based on A to B chassis testing performed according to the duty-cycle testing requirements of this part or in-use testing performed according to paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
