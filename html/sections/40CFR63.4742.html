A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4740 is

the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating, thinner, or cleaning material that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4710(c)(6) and 63.4720(a)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required by Sec. 63.4720, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations in Sec. 63.4690, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because you used no coating for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690, and you used no thinner or cleaning material that contained organic HAP, determined according to Sec. 63.4741(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec.
