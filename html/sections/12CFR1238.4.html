Except as noted in this subpart, in conducting a stress test under Sec. 1238.3, each regulated entity shall calculate how each of the following is affected during each quarter of the stress test planning horizon, for each scenario:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Potential losses, pre-provision net revenues, allowance for loan losses, and future pro forma capital positions over the planning horizon; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capital levels and capital ratios, including regulatory capital and net worth, each Bank's leverage and permanent capital ratios, and any other capital ratios, specified by FHFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Planning horizon. Each regulated entity must use a planning horizon of at least nine quarters over which the impact of specified scenarios would be assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional analytical techniques. If FHFA determines that the stress test methodologies and practices of a regulated entity are deficient, FHFA may determine that additional or alternative analytical techniques and exercises are appropriate for a regulated entity to use in identifying, measuring, and monitoring risks to the financial soundness of the regulated entity, and require a regulated entity to implement such techniques and exercises in order to fulfill the requirements of this part. In addition, FHFA will issue guidance annually to describe the baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios, and methodologies to be used in conducting the annual stress test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Controls and oversight of stress testing processes. (1) The appropriate senior management of each regulated entity must ensure that the regulated entity establishes and maintains a system of controls, oversight, and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the stress testing processes used by the regulated entity are effective in meeting the requirements of this part. These policies and procedures must, at a minimum, describe the regulated entity's testing practices and methodologies, validation and use of stress test results, and processes for updating the regulated entity's stress testing practices consistent with relevant supervisory guidance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate senior management of each regulated entity must ensure that the regulated entity establishes and maintains a system of controls, oversight, and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the stress testing processes used by the regulated entity are effective in meeting the requirements of this part.
