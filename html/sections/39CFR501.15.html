                                Sec. 501.15  Computerized Meter Resetting System.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. The Computerized Meter Resetting System (CMRS)  permits customers to reset their postage meters at their places of  business. Authorized providers, who operate CMRS services, are known as  resetting companies (RCs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A customer is required to have funds available on deposit with  the Postal Service before resetting a Postage Evidencing System or the  provider may opt to provide a funds advance in accordance with paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the RC chooses to offer advancement of funds to customers,  the RC is required to maintain a deposit with the Postal Service equal  to at least one (1) day's average funds advanced. The total amount of  funds advanced to customers on any given day shall not exceed the amount  the provider has on deposit with the Postal Service. The Postal Service  shall not be liable for any payment made by the RC on behalf of a  customer that is not reimbursed by the customer, since the RC is solely  responsible for the collection of advances made by the RC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The CMRS customer is permitted to make deposits in one of three  ways: check, electronic funds transfer (or wire transfer), or automated  clearinghouse (ACH) transfer. These deposits must be remitted to the  Postal Service's designated bank account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The RC must require each CMRS customer that requests a meter  resetting to provide the meter serial number, the CMRS account number,  and the meter's ascending and descending register readings. The RC must  verify that there are sufficient funds in the customer's CMRS account to  cover the postage setting requested before proceeding with the setting  transaction (unless the RC opts to provide the customer a funds  advance).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Postal Service requires that the RC publicize to all CMRS  customers the following payment options (listed in order of preference):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automated clearinghouse (ACH) debits/credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic funds transfers (wire transfers).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Checks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Returned checks and ACH debits are the responsibility of the  Postal Service. Upon notice from the Postal Service's designated bank,  the provider will be required to immediately lock the customer account  to prevent a meter reset until the Postal Service receives payment for  the returned check or the provider is provided with valid ACH credit or  wire information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Refunds. The Postal Service will issue a refund in the amount  remaining in a customer's Computerized Meter Resetting System account,  after such time as the customer provides a written request to the  provider, as long as the request meets the Postal Service approved  minimum and time frame.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Security and Revenue Protection. To receive Postal Service  approval to continue to operate systems in the CMRS environment, the RC  must submit to a periodic examination of its CMRS system and any other  applications and technology infrastructure that may have a material  impact on Postal Service revenues, as determined by the Postal Service.  The examination shall be performed by a qualified, independent audit  firm and shall be conducted in accordance with the Statements on  Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) No. 16, Service  Organizations, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants (AICPA), as amended or superseded. Expenses associated with  such examination shall be incurred by the RC. The examination shall  include testing of the operating effectiveness of relevant RC internal  controls (SOC 1 Type II SSAE 16 Report). If the service organization  uses another service organization (sub-service provider), Postal Service  management should consider the nature and materiality of the  transactions processed by the sub-service organization and the  contribution of the sub-service organization's processes and controls in  the achievement of the Postal Service's control objectives. The Postal  Service should have access to the sub-service organization's SOC 1 Type  II SSAE 16 report. The control objectives to be covered by the SOC 1  Type II SSAE 16 report are subject to Postal Service review and  approval, and are to be provided to the Postal Service 30 days prior to  the initiation of each examination period. As a result of the  examination, the service auditor shall provide the RC and the Postal  Service with an opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the  RC's internal controls related to the CMRS system and any other  applications and technology infrastructure considered material to the  services provided to the Postal Service by the RC. Such examinations are  to be conducted on no less than an annual basis, and are to be as of and  for the 12 months ended June 30 of each year (except for new contracts  for which the examination period will be no less than the period from  the contract date to the following June 30, unless otherwise agreed to  by the Postal Service). The examination reports are to be provided to  the Postal Service by August 15 of each year. To the extent that  internal control weaknesses are identified in a SOC 1 Type II SSAE 16  report, the Postal Service may require the remediation of such  weaknesses and review working papers and engage in discussions about the  work performed with the service auditor. The Postal Service requires  that all remediation efforts (if applicable) are completed and reported  by the RC prior to the Postal Service's fiscal year end (September 30).  In addition, the RC will be responsible for performing an examination of  their internal control environment related to the CMRS system and any  other applications and technology infrastructure considered material to  the services provided to the Postal Service by the RC, in particular,  disclosing changes to internal controls for the period of July 1 to  September 30. This examination should be documented and submitted to the  Postal Service by October 14. The RC will be responsible for all costs  related to the examinations conducted by the service auditor and the RC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Inspection of records and facilities. The RC must make its  facilities that handle the operation of the computerized resetting  system and all records about the operation of the system   available for inspection by representatives of the Postal Service at all  reasonable times. At its discretion, the Postal Service may continue to  fund inspections as it has in the past, provided the costs are not  associated with a particular security issue related to the provider's  CMRS or supporting infrastructure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The RC is required to incorporate the following language into  its meter rental agreements:</p><p class="depth2">Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters</p><p class="depth2">By signing this meter rental agreement, you the customer represent  that you have read the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters and  are familiar with its terms. You agree that, upon execution of this  agreement with the RC, you will also be bound by all terms and  conditions of the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters, as it  may be amended from time to time.  [71 FR 65733, Nov. 9, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 56472, Sept. 16, 2010;  77 FR 56554, Sept. 13, 2012; 79 FR 10994, Feb. 27, 2014]</p>
