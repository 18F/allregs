                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever  the administrative law judge certifies the record in a proceeding  directly to the DOT decisionmaker without issuing an initial or  recommended decision in the matter, the DOT decisionmaker shall, after  consideration of any briefs submitted by the parties, prepare a  tentative decision and serve it upon the parties. Every tentative  decision of the DOT decisionmaker shall state the names of the persons  who are to receive copies of it, the time within which exceptions to  such decision and briefs, if any, in support of or in opposition to the  exceptions may be filed, and the date when such decision will become  final in the absence of exceptions thereto. If no exceptions are filed  to the tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker within the period  fixed, it shall become final at the expiration of such period unless the  DOT decisionmaker orders otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The DOT decisionmaker may, in his or her discretion, omit a  tentative decision in proceedings under subpart   B. Final decisions of the DOT decisionmaker are subject to review as  provided in Sec. 302.18.</p>
