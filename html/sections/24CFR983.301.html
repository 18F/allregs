For rehabilitated or newly constructed housing, the Agreement states the estimated amount of the initial rent to owner, but the actual amount of the initial rent to owner is established at the beginning of the HAP contract term.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rent to owner is redetermined at the owner's request for a rent increase in accordance with this section and Sec. 983.302. The rent to owner is also redetermined at such time when there is a five percent or greater decrease in the published FMR in accordance with Sec. 983.302.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of rent to owner. Except for certain tax credit units as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amount determined by the PHA, not to exceed 110 percent of the applicable fair market rent (or any exception payment standard approved by the Secretary) for the unit bedroom size minus any utility allowance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reasonable rent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rent requested by the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rent to owner for certain tax credit units.

The PHA shall determine the reasonable rent in accordance with Sec. 983.303. The rent to the owner for each contract unit may at no time exceed the reasonable rent, except in cases where, the PHA has elected within the HAP contract not to reduce rents below the initial rent to owner and, upon redetermination of the rent to owner, the reasonable rent would result in a rent below the initial rent. If the PHA has not elected within the HAP contract to establish the initial rent to owner as the rent floor, the rent to owner shall not at any time exceed the reasonable rent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of FMRs and utility allowance schedule in determining the amount of rent to owner--(1) Amounts used. (i) Determination of initial rent (at beginning of HAP contract term). When determining the initial rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR in effect and the utility allowance schedule in effect at execution of the HAP contract.
