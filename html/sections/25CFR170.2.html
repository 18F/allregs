The Secretary of  the Interior will afford Indian tribes the flexibility, information, and  discretion to design roads programs under self-determination contracts  and self-governance agreements to meet the needs of their communities  consistent with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretaries recognize that programs, functions, services,  and activities, regardless of how they are administered, are an exercise  of Indian tribes' self-determination and self-governance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tribe is responsible for managing the day-to-day operation  of its contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tribe accepts responsibility and accountability to the  beneficiaries under self-determination contracts and self-governance  agreements for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of the funds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Satisfactory performance of all activities funded under the  contract or agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust  responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of tribes  and the trust resources of individual Indians.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary should interpret Federal laws and regulations to  facilitate including programs covered by this part in the government-to- government agreements authorized under ISDEAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The administrative functions referenced in paragraph (a)(5) of  this section are contractible without regard to the organizational level  within the Department of the Interior that carries out these functions.  Including IRR Program administrative functions under self-determination  contracts and self-governance agreements does not limit or reduce the  funding for any program or service serving any other tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for a tribe  under these programs to make funds available to another tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> This part must be liberally construed for the benefit of tribes  and to implement the Federal policy of self-determination and self- governance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Any ambiguities in this part must be construed in favor of the  tribes so as to facilitate and enable the transfer of programs  authorized by 23 U.S.C. 202 and title 25 U.S.C.</p>
