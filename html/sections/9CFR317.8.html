                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No product or any of its wrappers, packaging, or other  containers shall bear any false or misleading marking, label, or other  labeling and no statement, word, picture, design, or device which  conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin or  quality or is otherwise false or misleading shall appear in any marking  or other labeling. No product shall be wholly or partly enclosed in any  wrapper, packaging, or other container that is so made, formed, or  filled as to be misleading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The labels and containers of product shall comply with the  following provisions, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terms having geographical significance with reference to a  locality other than that in which the product is prepared may appear on  the label only when qualified by the word ``style,'' ``type,'' or  ``brand,'' as the case may be, in the same size and style of lettering  as in the geographical term, and accompanied with a prominent qualifying  statement identifying the country, State, Territory, or locality in  which the product is prepared, using terms appropriate to effect the  qualification. When the word ``style'' or ``type'' is used, there must  be a recognized style or type of product identified with and peculiar to  the area represented by the geographical term and the product must  possess the characteristics of such style or type, and the word  ``brand'' shall not be used in such a way as to be false or misleading:  Provided, That a geographical term which has come into general usage as  a trade name and which has been approved by the Administrator as being a  generic term may be used without the qualifications provided for in this  paragraph. The terms ``frankfurter,'' ``vienna,'' ``bologna,'' ``lebanon  bologna,'' ``braunschweiger,'' ``thuringer,'' ``genoa,'' ``leona,''  ``berliner,'' ``holstein,'' ``goteborg,'' ``milan,'' ``polish,''  ``italian,'' and their modifications, as applied to sausages, the terms  ``brunswick'' and ``irish'' as applied to stews and the term ``boston''  as applied to pork shoulder butts need not be accompanied with the word  ``style,'' ``type,'' or ``brand,'' or a statement identifying the  locality in which the product is prepared.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such terms as ``farm'' or ``country'' shall not be used on  labels in connection with products unless such products are actually  prepared on the farm or in the country: Provided, That if the product is  prepared in the same way as on the farm or in the country these terms,  if qualified by the word ``style'' in the same size and style of  lettering, may be used: Provided further, That the term ``farm'' may be  used as part of a brand designation when qualified by the word ``brand''  in the same size and style of lettering, and followed with a statement  identifying the locality in which the product is prepared: And Provided  further, That the provisions of this paragraph shall   not apply to products prepared in accordance with Sec. 319.106 of this  subchapter. Sausage containing cereal shall not be labeled ``farm  style'' or ``country style,'' and lard not rendered in an open kettle  shall not be designated as ``farm style'' or ``country style.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The requirement that the label shall contain the name and place  of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall not  relieve any establishment from the requirement that its label shall not  be misleading in any particular.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term ``spring lamb'' or ``genuine spring lamb'' is  applicable only to carcasses of new-crop lambs slaughtered during the  period beginning in March and terminating not beyond the close of the  week containing the first Monday in October.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Coverings shall not be of such color, design, or kind as to  be misleading with respect to color, quality, or kind of product to  which they are applied. For example, transparent or semitransparent  coverings for such articles as sliced bacon or fresh (uncooked) meat and  meat food products shall not bear lines or other designs of red or other  color which give a false impression of leanness of the product.  Transparent or semitransparent wrappers, casings, or coverings for use  in packaging cured, cured and smoked, or cured and cooked sausage  products, and sliced ready-to-eat meat food products may be color tinted  or bear red designs on 50 percent of such wrapper or covering: Provided,  That the transparent or semitransparent portion of the principal display  panel is free of color tinting and red designs: And provided further,  That the principal display panel provides at least 20 percent  unobstructed clear space, consolidated in one area so that the true  nature and color of the product is visible to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Packages for sliced bacon that have a transparent opening shall  be designed to expose, for viewing, the cut surface of a representative  slice. Packages for sliced bacon which meet the following specifications  will be accepted as meeting the requirements of this subparagraph  provided the enclosed bacon is positioned so that the cut surface of the  representative slice can be visually examined:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For shingle-packed sliced bacon, the transparent window shall be  designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension)  of the representative slice, and this window shall be at least 1\1/2\  inches wide. The transparent window shall be located not more than five- eighths inch from the top or bottom edge of a 1-pound or smaller package  and not more than three-fourths inch from either the top or bottom edge  of a package larger than 1 pound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For stack-packed sliced bacon, the transparent window shall be  designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension)  of the representative slice and be at least 1\1/2\ inches wide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The word ``fresh'' shall not be used on labels to designate  product which contains any sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium  nitrate, or potassium nitrite, or which has been salted for  preservation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No ingredient shall be designated on the label as a spice,  flavoring, or coloring unless it is a spice, flavoring, or coloring, as  the case may be. An ingredient that is both a spice and a coloring, or  both a flavoring and a coloring, shall be designated as ``spice and  coloring'', or ``flavoring and coloring'', as the case may be, unless  such ingredient is designated by its common or usual name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any ingredient not designated in Sec. 317.2(f)(1)(i) of this  part whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be  designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of  livestock and poultry origin must be designated by names that include  the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients  are derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> As used on labels of product, the term ``gelatin'' shall mean  (i) the jelly prepared in official establishments by cooking pork skins,  tendons, or connective tissue from inspected and passed product, and  (ii) dry commercial gelatin or the jelly resulting from its use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Product (other than canned product) labeled with the term  ``loaf'' as part of its name:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If distributed from the official establishment in consumer size  containers may be in any shape;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If distributed in a container of a size larger than that sold  intact at retail the product shall be prepared in rectangular form, or  as in paragraph (b)(9)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If labeled as an ``Old Fashioned Loaf'' shall be prepared in a  traditional form, such as rectangular with rounded top or circular with  flat bottom and rounded top.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The term ``baked'' shall apply only to product which has been  cooked by the direct action of dry heat and for a sufficient time to  permit the product to assume the characteristics of a baked article,  such as the formation of a brown crust on the surface, rendering out of  surface fat, and the caramelization of the sugar if applied. Baked  loaves shall be heated to a temperature of at least 160 [deg]F. and  baked pork cuts shall be heated to an internal temperature of at least  170 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> When products such as loaves are browned by dipping in hot  edible oil or by a flame, the label shall state such fact, e.g., by the  words ``Browned in Hot Cottonseed Oil'' or ``Browned by a Flame,'' as  the case may be, appearing as part of the product name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The term ``meat'' and the names of particular kinds of meat,  such as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork, shall not be used in such  manner as to be false or misleading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The word ``ham,'' without any prefix indicating the species of  animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection  with the hind legs of swine. Ham shanks as such or ham shank meat as  such or the trimmings accruing in the trimming and shaping of hams shall  not be labeled ``ham'' or ``ham meat'' without qualification. When used  in connection with a chopped product the term ``ham'' or ``ham meat''  shall not include the skin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> The terms ``shankless'' and ``hockless'' shall apply only to  hams and pork shoulders from which the shank or hock has been completely  removed, thus eliminating the entire tibia and fibula, or radius and  ulna, respectively, together with the overlying muscle, skin, and other  tissue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Such terms as ``meat extract'' or ``extract of beef'' without  qualification shall not be used on labels in connection with products  prepared from organs or other parts of the carcass, other than fresh  meat. Extracts prepared from any parts of the carcass other than fresh  meat may be properly labeled as extracts with the true name of the parts  from which prepared. In the case of extract in fluid form, the word  ``fluid'' shall also appear on the label, as, for example, ``fluid  extract of beef.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> When any product is enclosed in a container along with a  packing substance such as brine, vinegar, or agar jelly, a declaration  of the packing substance shall be printed prominently on the label as  part of the name of the product, as for example, ``frankfurts packed in  brine,'' ``lamb tongue packed in vinegar,'' or ``beef tongue packed in  agar jelly,'' as the case may be. The packing substance shall not be  used in such a manner as will result in the container being so filled as  to be misleading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> ``Leaf lard'' is lard prepared from fresh leaf fat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> When lard or hardened lard is mixed with rendered pork fat or  hardened rendered pork fat, the mixture shall be designated as  ``rendered pork fat'' or ``hardened rendered pork fat,'' as the case may  be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Oil, stearin, or stock obtained from beef or mutton fats  rendered at a temperature above 170 [deg]F. shall not be designated as  ``oleo oil,'' ``oleo stearin,'' or ``oleo stock,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> When not more than 20 percent of beef fat, mutton fat, oleo  stearin, vegetable stearin, or hardened vegetable fat is mixed with lard  or with rendered pork fat, there shall appear on the label, contiguous  to and in the same size and style of lettering as the name of the  product, the words ``beef fat added,'' ``mutton fat added,'' ``oleo  stearin added,'' ``vegetable stearin added,'' or ``hardened vegetable  fat added,'' as the case may be. If more than 20 percent is added, the  product name shall refer to the particular animal fat or fats used, such  as, ``Lard and Beef   Fat.'' The designation ``vegetable fat'' is applicable to vegetable oil,  vegetable stearin, or a combination of such oil and stearin, whereas the  designations ``vegetable oil'' and ``vegetable stearin'' shall be  applicable only to the oil and the stearin respectively, when used in  meat food products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Cooked, cured, or pickled pigs feet, pigs knuckles, and similar  products, shall be labeled to show that the bones remain in the product,  if such is the case. The designation ``semi-boneless'' shall not be used  if less than 50 percent of the total weight of bones has been removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> When monoglycerides, diglycerides, and/or polyglycerol esters  of fatty acids are added to rendered animal fat or a combination of such  fat and vegetable fat, there shall appear on the label in a prominent  manner and contiguous to the name of the product a statement such as  ``With Monoglycerides and Diglycerides Added,'' or ``With Diglycerides  and Monoglycerides,'' or ``With Polyglycerol Esters of Fatty Acids'' as  the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(24)</em> Section 407 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  contains provisions with respect to colored margarine or colored  oleomargarine (21 U.S.C. 347) which are set forth herein as footnote.  \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ``Sec. 407(a) Colored oleomargarine or colored margarine which  is sold in the same State or Territory in which it is produced shall be  subject in the same manner and to the same extent to the provisions of  this Act as if it had been introduced in interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No person shall sell, or offer for sale, colored oleomargarine  or colored margarine unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such oleomargarine or margarine is packaged,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The net weight of the contents of any package sold in a retail  establishment is one pound or less,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There appears on the label of the package (A) The word  `oleomargarine' or `margarine' in type or lettering at least as large as  any other type or lettering on such label, and (B) A full and accurate  statement of all the ingredients contained in such oleomargarine, or  margarine, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each part of the contents of the package is contained in a  wrapper which bears the word `oleomargarine' or `margarine' in type or  lettering not smaller than 20-point type.</p><p class="depth0">The requirements of this subsection shall be in addition to and not  in lieu of any of the other requirements of this Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No person shall possess in a form ready for serving colored  oleomargarine or colored margarine at a public eating place unless a  notice that oleomargarine or margarine is served is displayed  prominently and conspicuously in such place and in such manner as to  render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual  being served in such eating place or is printed or is otherwise set  forth on the menu in type or lettering not smaller than that normally  used to designate the serving of other food items.
