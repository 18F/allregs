                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The employer must comply with all manufacturer procedures  applicable to the operational functions of equipment, including its use  with attachments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unavailable operation procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the manufacturer  procedures are unavailable, the employer must develop and ensure  compliance with all procedures necessary for the safe operation of the  equipment and attachments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for the operational controls must be developed by a  qualified person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures related to the capacity of the equipment must be  developed and signed by a registered professional engineer familiar with  the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accessibility of procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The procedures applicable to  the operation of the equipment, including rated capacities (load  charts), recommended operating speeds, special hazard warnings,  instructions, and operator's manual, must be readily available in the  cab at all times for use by the operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where rated capacities are available in the cab only in  electronic form: In the event of a failure which makes the rated  capacities inaccessible, the operator must immediately cease operations  or follow safe shut-down procedures until the rated capacities (in  electronic or other form) are available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The operator must not engage in any practice or activity that  diverts his/her attention while actually engaged in operating the  equipment, such as the use of cellular phones (other than when used for  signal communications).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Leaving the equipment unattended. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operator must not  leave the controls while the load is suspended, except where all of the  following are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operator remains adjacent to the equipment and is not  engaged in any other duties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The load is to be held suspended for a period of time exceeding  normal lifting operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The competent person determines that it is safe to do so and  implements measures necessary to restrain the boom hoist and  telescoping, load, swing, and outrigger or stabilizer functions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Barricades or caution lines, and notices, are erected to  prevent all employees from entering the fall zone. No employees,  including those listed in Sec. Sec. 1926.1425(b)(1) through (3), Sec.  1926.1425(d) or Sec. 1926.1425(e), are permitted in the fall zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions in Sec. 1926.1417(e)(1) do not apply to working  gear (such as slings, spreader bars, ladders, and welding machines)  where the weight of the working gear is negligible relative to the  lifting capacity of the equipment as positioned, and the working gear is  suspended over an area other than an entrance or exit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tag-out--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tagging out of service equipment/functions. Where  the employer has taken the equipment out of service, a tag must be  placed in the cab stating that the equipment is out of service and is  not to be used. Where the employer has taken a function(s) out of   service, a tag must be placed in a conspicuous position stating that the  function is out of service and is not to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Response to ``do not operate''/tag-out signs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If there is a  warning (tag-out or maintenance/do not operate) sign on the equipment or  starting control, the operator must not activate the switch or start the  equipment until the sign has been removed by a person authorized to  remove it, or until the operator has verified that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No one is servicing, working on, or otherwise in a dangerous  position on the machine.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The equipment has been repaired and is working properly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is a warning (tag-out or maintenance/do not operate)  sign on any other switch or control, the operator must not activate that  switch or control until the sign has been removed by a person authorized  to remove it, or until the operator has verified that the requirements  in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Before starting the engine, the operator must verify that all  controls are in the proper starting position and that all personnel are  in the clear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Storm warning. When a local storm warning has been issued, the  competent person must determine whether it is necessary to implement  manufacturer recommendations for securing the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If equipment adjustments or repairs are necessary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operator must, in writing, promptly inform the person  designated by the employer to receive such information and, where there  are successive shifts, to the next operator; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer must notify all affected employees, at the  beginning of each shift, of the necessary adjustments or repairs and all  alternative measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Safety devices and operational aids must not be used as a  substitute for the exercise of professional judgment by the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> If the competent person determines that there is a slack rope  condition requiring re-spooling of the rope, it must be verified (before  starting to lift) that the rope is seated on the drum and in the sheaves  as the slack is removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The competent person must adjust the equipment and/or operations  to address the effect of wind, ice, and snow on equipment stability and  rated capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Compliance with rated capacity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The equipment must not be  operated in excess of its rated capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operator must not be required to operate the equipment in a  manner that would violate paragraph (o)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Load weight. The operator must verify that the load is within  the rated capacity of the equipment by at least one of the following  methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The weight of the load must be determined from a source  recognized by the industry (such as the load's manufacturer), or by a  calculation method recognized by the industry (such as calculating a  steel beam from measured dimensions and a known per foot weight), or by  other equally reliable means. In addition, when requested by the  operator, this information must be provided to the operator prior to the  lift; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The operator must begin hoisting the load to determine, using a  load weighing device, load moment indicator, rated capacity indicator,  or rated capacity limiter, if it exceeds 75 percent of the maximum rated  capacity at the longest radius that will be used during the lift  operation. If it does, the operator must not proceed with the lift until  he/she verifies the weight of the load in accordance with paragraph  (o)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The boom or other parts of the equipment must not contact any  obstruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The equipment must not be used to drag or pull loads sideways.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> On wheel-mounted equipment, no loads must be lifted over the  front area, except as permitted by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The operator must test the brakes each time a load that is 90%  or more of the maximum line pull is handled by lifting the load a few  inches and applying the brakes. In duty cycle and repetitive lifts where  each lift is 90% or   more of the maximum line pull, this requirement applies to the first  lift but not to successive lifts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Neither the load nor the boom must be lowered below the point  where less than two full wraps of rope remain on their respective drums.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Traveling with a load. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Traveling with a load is prohibited  if the practice is prohibited by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where traveling with a load, the employer must ensure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A competent person supervises the operation, determines if it is  necessary to reduce rated capacity, and makes determinations regarding  load position, boom location, ground support, travel route, overhead  obstructions, and speed of movement necessary to ensure safety.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The determinations of the competent person required in  paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section are implemented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For equipment with tires, tire pressure specified by the  manufacturer is maintained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Rotational speed of the equipment must be such that the load  does not swing out beyond the radius at which it can be controlled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> A tag or restraint line must be used if necessary to prevent  rotation of the load that would be hazardous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> The brakes must be adjusted in accordance with manufacturer  procedures to prevent unintended movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> The operator must obey a stop (or emergency stop) signal,  irrespective of who gives it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Swinging locomotive cranes. A locomotive crane must not be swung  into a position where railway cars on an adjacent track could strike it,  until it is determined that cars are not being moved on the adjacent  track and that proper flag protection has been established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Counterweight/ballast. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following applies to equipment  other than tower cranes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Equipment must not be operated without the counterweight or  ballast in place as specified by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum counterweight or ballast specified by the  manufacturer for the equipment must not be exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counterweight/ballast requirements for tower cranes are  specified in Sec. 1926.1435(b)(8).</p>
