This criterion applies to  the net effect of the action (transportation plan, TIP, or project not  from a conforming plan and TIP) on motor vehicle emissions from the  entire transportation system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ozone areas. The requirements of this paragraph apply to all  ozone NAAQS areas, except for certain requirements as indicated. This  criterion may be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  if a regional emissions analysis that satisfies the requirements of  Sec. 93.122 and paragraphs (g) through (j) of this section demonstrates  that for each analysis year and for each of the pollutants described in  paragraph (f) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The emissions predicted in the ``Action'' scenario are less than  the emissions predicted in the ``Baseline'' scenario, and this can be  reasonably expected to be true in the periods between the analysis  years; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The emissions predicted in the ``Action'' scenario are lower  than emissions in the baseline year for that   NAAQS as described in paragraph (e) of this section by any nonzero  amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In marginal and below ozone nonattainment areas and other ozone  nonattainment areas that are not subject to the reasonable further  progress requirements of CAA section 182(b)(1) if a regional emissions  analysis that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 93.122 and paragraphs  (g) through (j) of this section demonstrates that for each analysis year  and for each of the pollutants described in paragraph (f) of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The emissions predicted in the ``Action'' scenario are not  greater than the emissions predicted in the ``Baseline'' scenario, and  this can be reasonably expected to be true in the periods between the  analysis years; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The emissions predicted in the ``Action'' scenario are not  greater than emissions in the baseline year for that NAAQS as described  in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CO areas.

The regional emissions analysis must be performed  for the following pollutants:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VOC in ozone areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NOX in ozone areas, unless the EPA Administrator  determines that additional reductions of NOX would not  contribute to attainment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CO in CO areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> PM10 in PM10 areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> VOC and/or NOX in PM10 areas if the EPA  Regional Administrator or the director of the State air agency has made  a finding that one or both of such precursor emissions from within the  area are a significant contributor to the PM10 nonattainment  problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> NOX in NO2 areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> PM2.5 in PM2.5 areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Reentrained road dust in PM2.5 areas only if the EPA  Regional Administrator or the director of the State air agency has made  a finding that emissions from reentrained road dust within the area are  a significant contributor to the PM2.5 nonattainment problem  and has so notified the MPO and DOT;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> NOX in PM2.5 areas, unless the EPA  Regional Administrator and the director of the State air agency have  made a finding that emissions of NOX from within the area are  not a significant contributor to the PM2.5 nonattainment  problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> VOC, SO2 and/or ammonia in PM2.5 areas if  the EPA Regional Administrator or the director of the State air agency  has made a finding that any of such precursor emissions from within the  area are a significant contributor to the PM2.5 nonattainment  problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Analysis years. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regional emissions analysis must be  performed for analysis years that are no more than ten years apart. The  first analysis year must be no more than five years beyond the year in  which the conformity determination is being made. The last year of the  timeframe of the conformity determination (as described under  Sec. 93.106(d)) must also be an analysis year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>, and (d)(1) of  this section, a regional emissions analysis that satisfies the  requirements of Sec. 93.122 and paragraphs (g) through (j) of this  section would not be required for analysis years in which the  transportation projects and planning assumptions in the ``Action'' and  ``Baseline'' scenarios are exactly the same. In such a case, paragraph  (a) of this section can be satisfied by documenting that the  transportation projects and planning assumptions in both scenarios are  exactly the same, and consequently, the emissions predicted in the  ``Action'' scenario are not greater than the emissions predicted in the  ``Baseline'' scenario for such analysis years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the timeframe of the conformity determination is shortened  under Sec. 93.106(d)(2), the conformity determination must be  accompanied by a regional emissions analysis (for informational purposes  only) for the last year of the transportation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> ``Baseline'' scenario. The regional emissions analysis required  by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section must estimate the  emissions that would result from the ``Baseline'' scenario in each  analysis year. The ``Baseline'' scenario must be defined for each of the  analysis years. The ``Baseline'' scenario is the future transportation  system that will result from current programs, including the following  (except that exempt projects listed in Sec. 93.126 and projects exempt  from regional emissions analysis as listed in Sec. 93.127 need not be  explicitly considered):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All in-place regionally significant highway and transit  facilities, services and activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All ongoing travel demand management or transportation system  management activities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Completion of all regionally significant projects, regardless of  funding source, which are currently under construction or are undergoing  right-of-way acquisition (except for hardship acquisition and protective  buying); come from the first year of the previously conforming  transportation plan and/or TIP; or have completed the NEPA process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> ``Action'' scenario. The regional emissions analysis required by  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must   estimate the emissions that would result from the ``Action'' scenario in  each analysis year. The ``Action'' scenario must be defined for each of  the analysis years. The ``Action'' scenario is the transportation system  that would result from the implementation of the proposed action  (transportation plan, TIP, or project not from a conforming  transportation plan and TIP) and all other expected regionally  significant projects in the nonattainment area. The ``Action'' scenario  must include the following (except that exempt projects listed in  Sec. 93.126 and projects exempt from regional emissions analysis as  listed in Sec. 93.127 need not be explicitly considered):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All facilities, services, and activities in the ``Baseline''  scenario;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Completion of all TCMs and regionally significant projects  (including facilities, services, and activities) specifically identified  in the proposed transportation plan which will be operational or in  effect in the analysis year, except that regulatory TCMs may not be  assumed to begin at a future time unless the regulation is already  adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction or the TCM is identified in the  applicable implementation plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All travel demand management programs and transportation system  management activities known to the MPO, but not included in the  applicable implementation plan or utilizing any Federal funding or  approval, which have been fully adopted and/or funded by the enforcing  jurisdiction or sponsoring agency since the last conformity  determination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The incremental effects of any travel demand management programs  and transportation system management activities known to the MPO, but  not included in the applicable implementation plan or utilizing any  Federal funding or approval, which were adopted and/or funded prior to  the date of the last conformity determination, but which have been  modified since then to be more stringent or effective;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Completion of all expected regionally significant highway and  transit projects which are not from a conforming transportation plan and  TIP; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Completion of all expected regionally significant non-FHWA/FTA  highway and transit projects that have clear funding sources and  commitments leading toward their implementation and completion by the  analysis year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Projects not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP. For  the regional emissions analysis required by paragraphs (b) through (e)  of this section, if the project which is not from a conforming  transportation plan and TIP is a modification of a project currently in  the plan or TIP, the `Baseline' scenario must include the project with  its original design concept and scope, and the `Action' scenario must  include the project with its new design concept and scope.
