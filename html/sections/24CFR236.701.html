Projects in this category which are converted from Rent Supplement shall have Rental Assistance Contracts with terms which do not exceed the unexpired terms of the Rent Supplement Contracts.

Projects may not receive the benefit of rent supplement payments under part 215 of this Title and rental assistance payments at the same time. (Notwithstanding the provisions of this subpart, it shall be a matter of the Secretary's

discretion whether he enters into contracts for such benefits in connection with the sale of HUD-owned projects.) The conditions of eligibility for a Rental Assistance Contract and its terms are specified in this subpart D.
