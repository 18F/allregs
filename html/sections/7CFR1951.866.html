Security  requirements for loans from intermediaries to ultimate recipients will  be negotiated between the intermediaries and ultimate recipients.

The FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 may require additional security at any time during  the term of a loan to an intermediary if, after review and monitoring,  an assessment indicates the need for such security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appraisals. Real property serving as security for all loans to  intermediaries and for loans to ultimate recipients serving as security  for loans to intermediaries will be appraised by a qualified appraiser.  For all other types of property, a valuation shall be made using any  recognized, standard technique for the type of property involved  (including standard reference manuals), and this valuation shall be  described in the loan file.
