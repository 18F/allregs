A drawback  entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties, shall  not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the  import entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that  the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated  duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the  duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as  applicable, shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due  on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found  to be paid on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback  entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this  section, drawback may be paid on voluntary tenders of the unpaid amount  of lawful ordinary Customs duties or any other payment of lawful  ordinary Customs duties for an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for  consumption (see Sec. 191.3(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this part), provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a  specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for  consumption;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal  from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or  payment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically  identified import entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption  is designated has not become final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written request and waiver. Drawback may be paid on claims based  on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection  only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the  payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files  a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such  voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to  payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the  voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are  included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary  tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Claims based on liquidated duties. Drawback shall be based on  the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation  of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of  drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties,  and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquidation procedure. When the drawback claim has been  completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and  exportation (or destruction) of the articles has been established, the  drawback office shall determine drawback due on the basis of the  complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback  ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant  evidence or information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Relative value; multiple products--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distribution. Where two  or more products result from the manufacture or production of  merchandise, drawback shall be distributed to the several products in  accordance with their relative value at the time of separation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Value. The value to be used in computing the distribution of  drawback where two or more products result from the manufacture or  production of merchandise under drawback conditions shall be the market  value (see Sec. 191.2(u) of this part), unless another value is  approved by Customs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment. The drawback office shall authorize the amount of the  refund due as drawback to the claimant.  [T.D. 98-16, 63 FR 11006, Mar. 5, 1998; 63 FR 15289, Mar. 31, 1998]</p>
