                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recognizing that take or pay contract obligations may be  shielding the prices of deregulated and other higher cost gas from  market constraints, the Commission sets forth its general policy  regarding prepayments for natural gas pursuant to take or pay provisions  in gas contracts and amendments thereto between producers and interstate  pipelines which become effective December 23, 1982. The provisions of  this policy statement do not establish a binding norm but instead  provide general guidance. In particular cases, both the underlying  validity of the policy and its application to particular facts may be  challenged and are subject to further consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to gas purchase contracts entered into on or after  December 23, 1982, the Commission intends to apply a rebuttable  presumption in general rate cases that prepayments to producers will not  be given rate base treatment if the prepayments are made pursuant to  take or pay requirements in such gas purchase contracts or amendments  which exceed 75 percent of annual deliverability.  (Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717-717w; Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978,  Pub. L. No. 95-621, 92 Stat. 3350, 15 U.S.C. 3301-3432)  [47 FR 57269, Dec. 23, 1982]</p>
