(For use by individuals who are not eligible for retirement benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act or under the Railroad Retirement Act. This form may also be used for enrollment in the supplementary medical insurance program.)</p><p class="depth0">CMS-43--Application for Health Insurance Benefits under Medicare for Individuals with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). (An initial application for entitlement by individuals with ESRD).

As an alternative, an individual may use the application for monthly social benefits to apply also for Medicare entitlement if he or she is eligible for hospital insurance at that time.
