Each part (or subpart of section) in the subchapter  describes the specific statutory basis for the regulation. However,  where the basis is the Secretary's general authority to issue  regulations for any program under the Act (section 1102 of the Act), or  his general authority to prescribe State plan requirements needed for  proper and efficient administration of the   plan (section 1902(a)(4)), those statutory provisions are simply cited  without further description.</p>
