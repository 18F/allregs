                            <p class="depth0">The conditions of this subpart apply notwithstanding the existence  of an approved cost allocation plan. State agencies shall assign and  claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Development costs. (1) Using its normal departmental accounting  system, the State agency shall specifically identify what items of costs  constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project  cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the  specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the  approved APD; (2) the methods for distributing costs set forth in the  APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent  practicable, directly to program/functions. The State agency shall amend  the cost allocation plan required by subpart E of this part to include  the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment and  distribution of the development costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operational costs. Costs incurred for the operation of an ADP  system shall be identified and assigned by the State agency to funding  sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by  Subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service agreement costs. States that operate a central data  processing facility shall use their approved central service cost  allocation plan required by OMB Circular A-87 to identify and assign  costs incurred under service agreements with the State agency. The State  agency will then distribute these costs to funding sources in accordance  with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
