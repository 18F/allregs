                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A stress analysis shall be performed to determine if the tank  may be exposed to excessive loadings during the mechanical stress relief  process. This analysis should include consideration of the local  stresses in way of saddles or other supporting structure and additional  bending stresses due to the weight of the pressurizing liquid  particularly in areas of high stress concentration. While it is  necessary that the general stress level during the process be in excess  of the normal working level, the calculated maximum stress during test  shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield strength of the material at  test temperature. The supporting structure shall be analyzed to verify  its adequacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In all cases where the tanks are mechanically stress relieved in  place in the ship or barge and the tanks are designed to carry cargoes  with a specific gravity less than 1.05, the ship or barge shall be shown  to have adequate stability and buoyancy, as well as strength to carry  the excess weight of the tank during the stress relief procedure.</p>
