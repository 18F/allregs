                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C.

306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the Cooperator program. Evaluation of the Cooperator program's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by each Cooperator of the constraints and opportunities facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, a schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, a plan for achievement, and reports of activity results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a Cooperator's program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of program effectiveness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Cooperator shall conduct periodic evaluations of its program and activities and may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy this requirement. FAS reserves the right to have direct input and control over design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the independent evaluator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Cooperator shall complete at least one program evaluation each year. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the Cooperator and the Division Director and specified in the Cooperator's application approval letter. A program evaluation shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the party conducting the evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The activities covered by the evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A concise statement of the constraint(s) and opportunities and the goals specified in the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the evaluation methodology;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of additional export sales achieved, including the ratio of additional export sales in relation to Cooperator program funding received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Recommendations for future programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Cooperator shall submit, via a cover letter to the Division Director, an executive summary which assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposes changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.</p>
