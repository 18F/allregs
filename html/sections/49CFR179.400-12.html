                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Postweld heat treatment of the inner tank is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The cylindrical portion of the outer jacket, with the exception  of the circumferential closing seams, must be postweld heat treated as  prescribed in AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix W (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Any item to be welded to this portion of  the outer jacket must be attached before postweld heat treatment. Welds  securing the following need not be postweld heat treated when it is not  practical due to final assembly procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> the inner tank support system to the outer jacket,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> connections at piping penetrations,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> closures for access openings, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> circumferential closing joints of head to shell joints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When cold formed heads are used on the outer jacket they must be  heat treated before welding to the jacket shell if postweld heat  treatment is not practical due to assembly procedures.
