                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6)</em> and the regulations in part  301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). For  presumption as to an alien's nonresidence, see paragraph (b) of Sec.  1.871-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Residence defined. An alien actually present in the United  States who is not a mere transient or sojourner is a resident of the  United States for purposes of the income tax. Whether he is a transient  is determined by his intentions with regard to the length and nature of  his stay. A mere floating intention, indefinite as to time, to return to  another country is not sufficient to constitute him a transient. If he  lives in the United States and has no definite intention as to his stay,  he is a resident. One who comes to the United States for a definite  purpose which in its nature may be promptly accomplished is a transient;  but, if his purpose is of such a nature that an extended stay may be  necessary for its accomplishment, and to that end the alien makes his  home temporarily in the United States, he becomes a resident, though it  may be his intention at all times to return to his domicile abroad when  the purpose for which he came has been consummated or abandoned. An  alien whose stay in the United States is limited to a definite period by  the immigration laws is not a resident of the United States within the  meaning of this section, in the absence of exceptional circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application and effective dates. Unless the context indicates  otherwise, Sec. Sec. 1.871-2 through 1.871-5 apply to determine the  residence of aliens for taxable   years beginning before January 1, 1985. To determine the residence of  aliens for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, see section  7701(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 of this  chapter. However, for purposes of determining whether an individual is a  qualified individual under section 911(d)(1)(A), the rules of Sec. Sec.  1.871-2 and 1.871-5 shall continue to apply for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1984. For purposes of determining whether an  individual is a resident of the United States for estate and gift tax  purposes, see Sec. 20.0-1(b) (1) and (2) and Sec. 25.2501-1(b) of this  chapter, respectively.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15241, Apr. 27, 1992]</p>
