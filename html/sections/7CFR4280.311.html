                                Sec. 4280.311  Loan provisions for Agency loans to microlenders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of the loan. Loans will be made to eligible and qualified microlenders to capitalize RMRFs that it will administer by making and servicing microloans in one or more rural areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible activities. Microlenders may make microloans for qualified business activities and use Agency loan funds only as provided in Sec. 4280.322.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ineligible activities. Microlenders may not use RMRF funds for administrative costs or expenses and may not make microloans under this program for ineligible purposes as specified in Sec. 4280.323.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost share. The Federal share of the eligible project cost of a microborrower's project funded under this section shall not exceed 75 percent. The cost share requirement shall be met by the microlender using either of the options identified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section in establishing an RMRF. A microlender may establish multiple RMRFs utilizing either option. Whichever option is selected for an RMRF, it must apply to the entire RMRF and all microloans made with funds from that RMRF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Microborrower project level option. The loan covenants between the Agency and the microlender and the microlender's lending policies and procedures shall limit the microlender's loan to the microborrower to no more than 75 percent of the eligible project cost of the microborrower's project and require that the microborrower obtain the remaining 25 percent of the eligible project cost from non-Federal sources. The non-Federal share of the eligible project cost of the microborrower's project may be provided in cash (including through fees, grants (including community development block grants), and gifts) or in the form of in-kind contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RMRF level option. The microlender shall capitalize the RMRF at no more than 75 percent Agency loan funds and not less than 25 percent non-Federal funds, thereby allowing the microlender to finance 100 percent of the microborrower's eligible project costs. All contributed funds shall be maintained in the RMRF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loan terms and conditions for microlenders. Loans will be made to microlenders under the following terms and conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funds received from the Agency and any non-Federal share will be deposited into an interest-bearing account that will be the RMRF account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The RMRF account, including any interest earned on the account and the microloans made from the account, will be used to make fixed-rate microloans, to accept repayments from microborrowers and reimbursements from the LLRF, to repay the Agency and, with the advance written approval of the Agency, to supplement the LLRF with interest earnings (from payments received or from account earnings) from the RMRF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term of a loan made to a microlender will not exceed 20 years. If requested by the applicant MDO, a shorter term may be agreed upon by the microlender and the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each loan made to a microlender will automatically receive a 2-year deferral during which time no repayment to the Agency will be required. Voluntary payments will be accepted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest will accrue during the deferral period only on funds disbursed by the Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The deferral period will begin on the day the Agency loan to the microlender is closed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Loan repayments will be made in equal monthly installments to the Agency beginning on the last day of the 24th month of the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Partial or full repayment of debt to the Agency under this program may be made at any time, including during the deferral period, without any pre-payment penalties being assessed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The microlender is responsible for full repayment of its loan to the Agency regardless of the performance of its microloan portfolio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Agency may call the entire loan due and payable prior to the end of the full term, due to any non-performance, delinquency, or default on the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Loan closing between the microlender and the Agency must take place within 90 days of loan approval or funds will be forfeited and the loan will be deobligated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Microlenders will be eligible to receive a disbursement of up to 25 percent of the total loan amount at the time of loan closing. Interest will accrue on all funds disbursed to the microlender beginning on the date of disbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A microlender must make one or more microloans within 60 days of any disbursement it receives from the Agency. Failure to make a microloan within this time period may result in the microlender not receiving any additional funds from the Agency and may result in the Agency demanding return of any funds already disbursed to the microlender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Microlenders may request in writing, and receive additional disbursements not more than quarterly, until the full amount of the loan to the microlender is disbursed, or until the end of the 36th month of the loan, whichever occurs first. Letters of request for disbursement must be accompanied by a description of the microlender's anticipated need. Such description will indicate the amount and number of microloans anticipated to be made with the funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Each loan made to a microlender during its first five years of participation in this program will bear an interest rate of 2 percent. After the fifth year of an MDO's continuous and satisfactory participation in this program, each new loan made to the microlender will bear an interest rate of 1 percent. Satisfactory participation requires a default rate of 5 percent or less and a pattern of delinquencies of 10 percent or less. Except in the case of liquidation or early repayment, loans to microlenders must fully amortize over the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> During the initial deferral period, each loan to a microlender will accrue interest at a rate of 1 or 2 percent based on the ultimate interest rate on the loan. Interest accrued during the 2-year deferral period will be capitalized so that, during the 24th month of the initial deferral period, the microlender's debt to the Agency will be calculated and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. The first payment will be due to the Agency on the last day of the 24th month of the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Funds not disbursed to the microlender by the end of the 36th month of the loan from the Agency will be de-obligated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The Agency will hold first lien position on the RMRF account, the LLRF, and all notes receivable from microloans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> If a microlender makes a withdrawal from the RMRF for any purpose other than to make a microloan, repay the Agency, or, with advance written approval, transfer an appropriate amount of non-Federal funds to the LLRF, the Agency may restrict further access to withdrawals from the account by the microlender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> In the event a microlender fails to meet its obligations to the Agency, the Agency may pursue any combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Take possession of the RMRF and/or any microloans outstanding, and/or the LLRF;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Call the loan due and payable in full; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Enter into a workout agreement acceptable to the Agency, which may or may not include transfer or sale of the portfolio to another microlender (whether or not funded under this program) deemed acceptable to the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Loan funding limitations--(1) Minimum and maximum loan amounts. The minimum loan amount a microlender may borrow under this program will be $50,000. The maximum any microlender may borrow on a single loan under this program, or in any given Federal fiscal year, will be $500,000. In no case will the aggregate outstanding balance owed to the program by any single microlender exceed $2,500,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum and maximum loan amounts. The minimum loan amount a microlender may borrow under this program will be $50,000. The maximum any microlender may borrow on a single loan under this program, or in any given Federal fiscal year, will be $500,000. In no case will the aggregate outstanding balance owed to the program by any single microlender exceed $2,500,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of funds. Loans must be used only to establish or recapitalize an existing Agency funded RMRF out of which microloans will be made, into which microloan payments will be deposited, and from which repayments to the Agency will be made. In some instances, as described in Sec. 4280.311(e)(2), interest earned by these funds may be used to fund and recapitalize both RMRF and the LLRF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Loan loss reserve fund (LLRF). Each microlender that receives one or more loans under this program will be required to establish an interest-bearing LLRF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the LLRF is to protect the microlender and the Agency against losses that may occur as the result of the failure of one or more microborrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capitalization and maintenance. The LLRF is subject to each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The microlender must maintain the LLRF at a minimum of 5 percent of the total amount owed by the microlender under this program to the Agency. If the LLRF falls below the required amount, the microlender will have 30 days to replenish the LLRF. The Agency will hold a security interest in the account and all funds therein until the MDO has repaid its debt to the Agency under this program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No Agency loan funds may be used to capitalize the LLRF.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The LLRF must be held in an interest-bearing, Federally-insured deposit account separate and distinct from any other fund owned by the microlender.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The LLRF must remain open, appropriately capitalized, and active until such time as:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All obligations owed to the Agency by the microlender under this program are paid in full; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The LLRF is used to assist with full repayment or prepayment of the microlender's program debt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Earnings on the LLRF account must remain a part of the account except as stipulated in Sec. 4280.311(e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of LLRF. The LLRF must be used only to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recapitalize the RMRF in the event of the loss and write-off of a microloan; that is, when a loss has been paid to the RMRF, from the LLRF, the microlender must, within 30 days, replenish the LLRF, with non-federal funds, to the required level;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Accept non-Federal deposits as required for maintenance of the fund at a level equal to 5 percent or more of the amount owed to the Agency by the microlender under this program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accrue interest (interest earnings accrued by the LLRF will become part of the LLRF and may be used only for eligible purposes); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prepay or repay the Agency program loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> LLRF funded at time of closing. The LLRF account must be established by the microlender prior to the closing of the loan from the Agency. At the time of initial loan closing, sources of funding for the LLRF must be identified by the microlender so that as microloans are made, the amount in the LLRF can be built over time to an amount greater than or equal to 5 percent of the amount owed to the Agency by the microlender under this program. After the first disbursement is made to a microlender, further disbursements will only be made if the LLRF is funded at the appropriate amount. After the initial loan is made to a microlender, subsequent loan closings will require the LLRF to be funded in an amount equal to 5 percent of the anticipated initial drawdown of funds for the RMRF. Federal funds, except where specifically permitted by other laws, may not be used to fund LLRF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional LLRF funding. In the event of exhibited weaknesses, such as losses that are greater than 5 percent of the microloan portfolio, on the part of a microlender, the Agency may require additional funding be put into the LLRF; however, the Agency may never require an LLRF of more than 10 percent of the total amount owed by the microlender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recordkeeping, reporting, and oversight. Microlenders must maintain all records applicable to the program and make them available to the Agency upon request. Microlenders must submit quarterly reports as specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section. Portfolio reporting requirements must be met via the electronic reporting system. Other reports, such as narrative information, may be submitted as hard copy in the event the microlender, grantee, or Agency do not have the capability to submit or accept same electronically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Periodic reports. On a quarterly basis, within 30 days of the end of the calendar quarter, each microlender that has an outstanding loan under this section must provide to the Agency:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Quarterly reports, using an Agency-approved automation system, containing such information as the Agency may require, and in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA in 2 CFR part 400, to ensure that funds provided are being used for the purposes for which the loan to the microlender was made. At a minimum, these reports must identify each microborrower under this program and should include a discussion reconciling the microlender's actual results for the period against its goals, milestones, and objectives as provided in the application package; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimum retention. Microlenders must provide evidence in their quarterly reports that the sum of the unexpended amount in the RMRF, plus the amount in the LLRF, plus debt owed by the microborrowers is equal to a minimum of 105 percent of the amount owed by the microlender to the Agency unless the Agency has established a higher LLRF reserve requirement for a specific microlender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combining accounts and reports. If a microlender has more than one loan

from the Agency, a separate report must be made for each except when RMRF accounts have been combined. A microlender may combine RMRF accounts only when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The underlying loans have the same rates, terms and conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The combined report allows the Agency to effectively administer the program, including providing the same level of transparency and information for each loan as if separate RMRF reports had been prepared; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The accompanying LLRF fund reports also provide the same level of transparency and information for each loan as if separate LLRF reports had been prepared.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Agency must approve the combining of accounts and reports in writing before such accounts are combined and reports are submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Delinquency. In the event that a microlender has delinquent loans in its RMAP portfolio, quarterly reports will include narrative explanation of the steps being taken to cure the delinquencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other reports. Other reports may be required by the Agency from time to time in the event of poor performance, one or more work out agreements or other such occurrences that require more than the usual set of reporting information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Site visits. The Agency may, at any time, choose to visit the microlender and inspect its files to ensure that program requirements are being met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Access to microlender's records. Upon request by the Agency, the microlender will permit representatives of the Agency (or other agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized by that Department or the U.S. Government) to inspect and make copies of any records pertaining to operation and administration of this program. Such inspection and copying may be made during regular office hours of the microlender or at any other time agreed upon between the microlender and the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Changes in key personnel. Before any additions are made to key personnel, the microlender must notify and the Agency must approve such changes.
