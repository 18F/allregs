This monitoring shall be done with techniques that do not jeopardize the isolation of the wastes and shall be conducted until there are no significant concerns to be addressed by further monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposal sites shall be designated by the most permanent markers, records, and other passive institutional controls practicable to indicate the dangers of the wastes and their location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposal systems shall use different types of barriers to isolate the wastes from the accessible environment. Both engineered and natural barriers shall be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Places where there has been mining for resources, or where there is a reasonable expectation of exploration for scarce or easily accessible resources, or where there is a significant concentration of any material that is not widely available from other sources, should be avoided in selecting disposal sites. Resources to be considered shall include minerals, petroleum or natural gas, valuable geologic formations, and ground waters that are either irreplaceable because there is no reasonable alternative source of drinking water available for substantial populations or that are vital to the preservation of unique and sensitive eco systems. Such places shall not be used for disposal of the wastes covered by this part unless the favorable char acter is tics of such places com pen sate for their greater likelihood of being dis turbed in the future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposal systems shall be selected so that removal of most of the wastes is not precluded for a reasonable period of time after disposal.</p>
