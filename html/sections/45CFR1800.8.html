Truman Scholarship Foundation, 712 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20006. The Executive Secretary will, not later than thirty working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, complete such review and make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Executive Secretary extends such thirty day period. If, after his or her review, the Executive Secretary also refuses to correct or to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual may file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Foundation and may seek judicial review of the Executive Secretary's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A).</p>
