                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal Bureau of Investigation, hereinafter referred to as  the FBI, is authorized to expend funds for the exchange of  identification records with officials of federally chartered or insured  banking institutions to promote or maintain the security of those  institutions and, if authorized by state statute and approved by the  Director of the FBI, acting on behalf of the Attorney General, with  officials of state and local governments for purposes of employment and  licensing, pursuant to section 201 of Public Law 92-544, 86 Stat. 1115.  Also, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78q, 7 U.S.C. 21 (b)(4)(E), and 42 U.S.C.  2169, respectively, such records can be exchanged with certain segments  of the securities industry, with registered futures associations, and  with nuclear power plants. The records also may be exchanged in other  instances as authorized by federal law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FBI Director is authorized by 28 CFR 0.85(j) to approve  procedures relating to the exchange of identification records. Under  this authority, effective September 6, 1990, the FBI Criminal Justice  Information Services (CJIS) Division has made all data on identification  records available for such purposes. Records obtained under this  authority may be used solely for the purpose requested and cannot be  disseminated outside the receiving departments, related agencies, or  other authorized entities. Officials at the governmental institutions  and other entities authorized to submit fingerprints and receive FBI  identification records under this authority must notify the individuals  fingerprinted that the fingerprints will be used to check the criminal  history records of the FBI. The officials making the determination of  suitability for licensing or employment shall provide the applicants the  opportunity to complete, or challenge the accuracy of, the information  contained in the FBI identification record. These officials also must  advise the applicants that procedures for obtaining a change,  correction, or updating of an FBI identification record are set forth in  28 CFR 16.34. Officials making such determinations should not deny the  license or employment based on information in the record until the  applicant has been afforded a reasonable time to correct or complete the  record, or has declined to do so. A statement incorporating these use- and-challenge requirements will be placed on all records disseminated  under this program. This policy is intended to ensure that all relevant  criminal record information is made available to provide for the public  safety and, further, to protect the interests of the prospective  employee/licensee who may be affected by the information or lack of  information in an identification record.
