                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General purpose. This section sets forth the procedures to be  followed if the monthly SNAP allotments determined in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 273.10 must be reduced, suspended, or cancelled  to comply with section 18 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as  amended. The best available data pertaining to the number of people  participating in the program and the amounts of benefits being issued  shall be used in deciding whether such action is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nature of reduction action. Action to comply with section 18 of  the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, may be a suspension or  cancellation of allotments for one or more months, a reduction in  allotment levels for one or more months or a combination of these three  actions. If a reduction in allotments is deemed necessary, allotments  shall be reduced by reducing maximum SNAP allotments amounts for each  household size by the same percentage. This results in all households of  a given size having their benefits reduced by the same dollar amount.  The dollar reduction would be smallest for one-person households and  greatest for the largest households. Since the dollar amount would be  the same for all households of the same size, the rate of reduction  would be lowest for zero net income households and greatest for the  highest net income households. All one- and two-person households  affected by a reduction action shall be guaranteed the minimum benefit  unless the action is a cancellation of benefits, a suspension of  benefits, or a reduction of benefits of 90 percent or more of the total  amount of benefits projected to be issued in the affected month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction method. If a reduction in allotments is deemed  necessary, the   maximum SNAP allotments amounts for all household sizes shall be reduced  by a percentage specified by FNS. For example, if it is determined that  a 25 per cent reduction in the maximum SNAP allotments amount is to be  made, the reduction for all four-person households would be calculated  as follows: The maximum SNAP allotments amount for a four-person  household ($209 in November 1980) would be reduced by 25% to $157. Then  30 percent of the household's net SNAP income would be deducted from the  reduced maximum SNAP allotments amount. For example, 30 per cent of a  net SNAP income of $200, $60, would be deducted from the reduced maximum  SNAP allotments amount ($157), resulting in a reduced allotment of $97.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Implementation of allotment reductions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reductions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a  decision is made to reduce monthly SNAP allotments, FNS shall notify  State agencies of the date the reduction is to take effect and by what  percentage maximum SNAP allotments amounts are to be reduced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon receiving notification that a reduction is to be made in  an upcoming month's allotment, State agencies shall act immediately to  implement the reduction. Such action could differ from State to State  depending on the nature of the issuance system in use. Where there are  computerized issuance systems, the program used for calculating  allotments shall be altered to reflect the appropriate percentage  reduction in the maximum SNAP allotments for each household size and the  computer program shall be adjusted to allow for the minimum benefit for  one- and two-person households. The computer program shall also be  adjusted to provide for the rounding of benefit levels of $1, $3 and $5  to $2, $4 and $6, respectively. FNS will provide State agencies with  revised issuance tables reflecting the percentage reductions to be made  in the maximum SNAP allotments amounts and reduce maximum SNAP  allotments levels. In States where manual issuance is used, State  agencies shall reproduce the issuance tables provided by FNS and  distribute them to issuance personnel. State agencies shall ensure that  the revised issuance tables are distributed to issuance agents and  personnel in time to allow benefit reductions during the month ordered  by FNS. In an HIR card system State agencies have the option of enacting  the reduction in benefits either by changing all HIR cards before  issuance activity for the affected month begins or by adjusting  allotments at the point of issuance as each household appears at the  issuance office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspensions and cancellations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a decision is made to  suspend or cancel the distribution of SNAP benefits in a given month,  FNS shall notify State agencies of the date the suspension or  cancellation is to take effect. In the event of a suspension or  cancellation of benefits, the provision for the minimum benefit for  households with one or two members only shall be disregarded and all  households shall have their benefits suspended or cancelled. Upon  receiving notification that an upcoming month's issuance is to be  suspended or cancelled, State agencies shall take immediate action to  effect the suspension or cancellation. This action would involve making  necessary computer adjustments, and notifying issuance agents and  personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon being notified by FNS that a suspension of benefits is  over, State agencies shall act immediately to resume issuing benefits to  certified households and shall resume benefit issuance as soon as  practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affected allotments. Whenever a reduction of allotments is  ordered for a particular month, reduced benefits shall be calculated for  all households for the designated month. However, any household with one  or two members whose reduced benefits would be less than the minimum  benefit shall receive the minimum benefit except as provided in  Sec. 273.10(e)(2). Allotments or portions of allotments representing  restored or retroactive benefits for a prior unaffected month would not  be reduced, suspended, or cancelled even though they are issued during  an affected month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notification of eligible households. Reductions, suspensions and  cancellations of allotments shall be considered to be Federal  adjustments to allotments. As such, State agencies shall   notify households of reductions, suspensions and cancellations of  allotments in accordance with the notice provisions of  Sec. 273.12(e)(1), except that State agencies shall not provide notices  of adverse action to households affected by reductions, suspensions or  cancellations of allotments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Restoration of benefits. Households whose allotments are reduced  or cancelled as a result of the enactment of these procedures are not  entitled to the restoration of the lost benefits at a future date.  However, if there is a surplus of funds as a result of the reduction or  cancellation, FNS shall direct State agencies to provide affected  households with restored benefits unless the Secretary determines that  the amount of surplus funds is too small to make this practicable. The  procedures implemented by State agencies for reducing and cancelling  benefits shall be designed so that in the event FNS directs the  restoration of benefits, such benefits are issued promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effects of reductions, suspensions and cancellations on the  certification of eligible households. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, determinations of the eligibility of  applicant households shall not be affected by reductions, suspensions or  cancellations of allotments. State agencies shall accept and process  applications during a month(s) in which a reduction, suspension or  cancellation is in effect in accordance with the requirements of part  273. Determinations of eligibility shall also be made according to the  provisions of part 273. If an applicant is found to be eligible for  benefits and a reduction is in effect, the amount of benefits shall be  calculated by reducing the maximum SNAP allotments amount by the  appropriate percentage for the applicant's household size and then  deducting 30 percent of the household's net SNAP income from the reduced  maximum SNAP allotments amount. If an applicant is found to be eligible  for benefits while a suspension or cancellation is in effect, no  benefits shall be issued to the applicant until issuance is again  authorized by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expedited service. (i) Households eligible to receive expedited  processing who apply for program benefits during months in which  reductions or suspensions are in effect, shall have their cases  processed in accordance with the expedited processing provisions of  Sec. 273.2</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Those households that receive expedited service in months in  which reductions are in effect and that are determined to be eligible  shall be issued allotments that are reduced in accordance with the  reduction in effect. These reduced allotments shall be made available to  the households within the benefit delivery timeframe specified in  Sec. 273.2(i).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Those households that receive expedited service in months in  which suspensions are in effect and that are determined to be eligible  shall have benefits issued to them within the timeframe specified in  Sec. 273.2(i). However, if the suspension is still in effect at the time  issuance is to be made, the issuance shall be suspended until the  suspension is ended.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Households eligible to receive expedited processing who apply  for Program benefits during months in which cancellations are in effect  shall receive expedited service. However, the deadline for completing  the processing of such cases shall be five calendar days or the end of  the month of application, whichever date is later. All other rules  pertaining to expedited service, contained in Sec. 273.2(i), shall be  applicable to these cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reduction, suspension or cancellation of allotments in a  given month shall have no effect on the certification periods assigned  to households. Those participating households whose certification  periods expire during a month in which allotments have been reduced,  suspended or cancelled shall be recertified according to the provisions  of Sec. 273.14. Households found eligible to participate during a month  in which allotments have been reduced, suspended or cancelled shall have  certification periods assigned in accordance with the provisions of  Sec. 273.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fair hearings. Any household that has its allotment reduced,  suspended or cancelled as a result of an order issued by FNS in  accordance with these rules may request a fair hearing if it disagrees  with the action, subject to the following conditions. State agencies   shall not be required to hold fair hearings unless the request for a  fair hearing is based on a household's belief that its benefit level was  computed incorrectly under these rules or that the rules were misapplied  or misinterpreted. State agencies shall be allowed to deny fair hearings  to those households who are merely disputing the fact that a reduction,  suspension or cancellation was ordered. Furthermore, since the  reduction, suspension or cancellation would be necessary to avoid an  expenditure of funds beyond those appropriated by Congress, households  do not have a right to a continuation of benefits pending the fair  hearing. A household may receive retroactive benefits in an appropriate  amount if it is determined that its benefits were reduced by more than  the amount by which the State agency was directed to reduce benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Issuance services. State agencies must have issuance services  available to serve housholds receiving restored or retroactive benefits  for a prior, unaffected month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Penalties. Notwithstanding any other provision of this  subchapter, FNS may take one or more of the following actions against a  State agency that fails to comply with a directive to reduce, suspend or  cancel allotments in a particular month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If FNS ascertains that a State agency does not plan to comply  with a directive to reduce, suspend or cancel allotments for a  particular month, a warning will be issued advising the State agency  that if it does not comply, FNS may cancel 100 percent of the Federal  share of the State agency's administrative costs for the affected  month(s). If, after receiving such a warning, a State agency does not  comply with a directive to reduce, suspend or cancel allotments, FNS may  cancel 100 percent of the Federal share of the State agency's  administrative costs for the affected month(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If FNS ascertains after warning a State agency as provided in  paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the State agency does not plan to  comply with a directive to reduce, suspend or cancel allotments, a court  injunction may be sought to compel compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State agency fails to reduce, suspend or cancel allotments  as directed, FNS will bill the State agency for all over issuances that  result. If a State agency fails to remit the billed amount to FNS within  a prescribed period of time the funds will be recovered through offsets  against the Federal share of the State agency's administrative costs, or  any other means available under law.
