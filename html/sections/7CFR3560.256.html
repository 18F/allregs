                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Borrower submission requirements. The borrower must submit monthly requests for RA payments to the Agency based on occupancy as of the first day of the month previous to the month in which the request is being made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis of RA requests. Borrower requests for RA payments must be based on the difference between the basic rent plus utility allowances for each rental unit eligible for RA and the net tenant contribution of the tenant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payments to borrower. Prior to making RA payments to a borrower, the Agency will deduct from the approved RA payment amount any unpaid loan payments, late fees, and other amounts which the borrower owes to the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Utility payments to tenants. The borrower must pay tenants the difference between the utility allowance and the tenant's net contribution to rent when a tenant receiving RA is billed directly for utilities and the utility allowance exceeds the net tenant contribution to rent. Such utility payments to tenants must be made on a monthly basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Administrative errors. Borrowers are responsible for correcting borrower errors made in regard to RA requests for payments. In accordance with subpart O of this part, borrowers will be required to repay the Agency for any unauthorized RA received or any unauthorized use of RA except in certain cases of tenant error or fraud.</p>
