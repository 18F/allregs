                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. The Chairman or the Chairman's designee may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees for records. Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of employee time spent in reviewing the request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. These fees and costs will be calculated and charged as are like fees and costs arising from requests made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act regulations in Part 2411.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Witness fees. Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear and on 28 U.S.C. 1821, as applicable. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel and for attendance in the legal proceeding, plus travel costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of fees. A requester must pay witness fees for current employees and any record certification fees by submitting to the Office of the Solicitor a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony of former employees, the requester must pay applicable fees directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. The Chairman or the Chairman's designee, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> De minimis fees. Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.</p>
