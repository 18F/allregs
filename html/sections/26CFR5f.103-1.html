                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> or any other provision  of law, exclusive of any treaty obligation of the United States, unless  the obligation is issued in registered form (as defined in paragraph (c)  of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Registration-required obligation. For purposes of this section,  the term ``registration-required obligation'' means any obligation  except any one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An obligation not of a type offered to the public. The  determination as to whether an obligation is not of a type offered to  the public shall be based on whether similar obligations are in fact  publicly offered or traded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An obligation that has a maturity at the date of issue of not  more than 1 year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An obligation issued before January 1, 1983. An obligation first  issued before January 1, 1983, shall not be considered to have been  issued on or after that date merely as a result of the existence of a  right on the part of the holder of such obligation to convert the  obligation from registered form into bearer form, or as a result of the  exercise of such a right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An obligation described in Sec. 5f.163-1 (c) (relating to  certain obligations issued to foreign persons).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Registered form--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An obligation issued after  January 20, 1987, pursuant to a binding contract entered into after  January 20, 1987, is in registered form if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated  interest with the issuer (or its agent) and transfer of the obligation  may be effected only by surrender of the old instrument and either the  reissuance by the issuer of the old instrument to the new holder or the  issuance by the issuer of a new instrument to the new holder,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The right to the principal of, and stated interest on, the  obligation may be transferred only through a book entry system  maintained by the issuer (or its agent) (as described in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The obligation is registered as to both principal and any  stated interest with the issuer (or its agent) and may be transferred  through both of the methods described in subdivisions (i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for registration of a book entry obligation. An  obligation shall be considered transferable through a book entry system  if the ownership of an interest in the obligation is required to be  reflected in a book entry, whether or not physical securities are  issued. A book entry is a record of ownership that identifies the owner  of an interest in the obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section shall apply to  obligations issued after December 31, 1982, unless issued on an exercise  of a warrant for the conversion of a convertible obligation if such  warrant or obligation was offered or sold outside the United States  without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and was issued  before August 10, 1982.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rules. The following special rules apply to obligations  issued after January 20, 1987, pursuant to a binding contract entered  into after January 20, 1987.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An obligation that is not in registered form under paragraph (c)  of this section is considered to be in bearer form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An obligation is not considered to be in registered form as of a  particular time if it can be transferred at that time or at any time  until its maturity by any means not described in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An obligation that as of a particular time is not considered to  be in registered form by virtue of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  (e) and that, during a period beginning with a later time and ending  with the maturity of the obligation, can be transferred only by a means  described in paragraph (c) of this section, is considered to be in  registered form at all times during such period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). Municipality X publicly offers its general debt  obligations to United States persons. The obligations have a maturity at  issue exceeding 1 year. The obligations are registration-required  obligations under Sec. 5f.103-1(b). When individual A buys an  obligation, X issues an obligation in A's name evidencing A's ownership  of the principal and interest under the obligation. A can transfer the  obligation only by surrendering the obligation to X and by X issuing a  new instrument to the new holder. The obligation is issued in registered  form.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). Municipality Y issues a single obligation on January 4,  1983 to Bank M provided that (i) Bank M will not at any time transfer  any interest in the obligation to any person unless the transfer is  recorded on Municipality Y's records (except by means of a transfer  permitted in (ii) of this example) and (ii) interests in the obligation  that are sold by Bank M (and any persons who acquire interests from M)  will be reflected in book entries. C, an individual, buys an interest in  Y's obligation from Bank M. Bank M receives the interest or principal  payments with respect to C's interest in the obligation as agent for C.  Bank M records interests in the Municipality Y obligation as agent of  Municipality Y. Any transfer of C's interest must be reflected in a book  entry in accordance with Bank M's agreement with Municipality Y. Since  C's interest can only be transferred through a book entry system  maintained by the issuer (or its agent), the obligation is considered  issued in registered form. Interest received by C is excludable from  gross income under section 103(a).</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). Municipality Z wishes to sell its debt obligations  having a maturity in excess of 1 year. The obligations are sold to Banks  N, O, and P, all of which are located in Municipality Z. By their terms  the obligations are freely transferable, although each of the banks has  stated that it acquired the obligations for purposes of investment and  not for resale. Obligations similar to the obligations sold by  Municipality Z are traded in the market for municipal securities. The  obligations issued by Municipality Z are of a type offered to the public  and are therefore registration-required under Sec. 5f.103-1 (b).</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). Corporation A issues an obligation that is registered  with the corporation as to both principal and any stated interest.  Transfer may be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and  either the reissuance by the issuer of the old instrument to the new  holder or the issuance by the issuer of a new instrument to the new  holder. The obligation can be converted into a form in which the right  to the principal of, or stated interest on, the obligation may be  effected by physical transfer of the obligation. Under Sec. 5f.103-1  (c) and (e), the obligation is not considered to be in registered form  and is considered to be in bearer form.</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). Corporation B issues its obligations in a public  offering in bearer definitive form. Beginning at X months after the  issuance of the obligations, a purchaser (either the original purchaser  or a purchaser in the secondary market) may deliver the definitive bond  in bearer form to the issuer in exchange for a registration receipt  evidencing a book entry record of the ownership of the obligation. The  issuer maintains the book entry system. The purchaser identified in the  book entry as the owner of record has the right to receive a definitive  bearer obligation at any time. Under Sec. 5f.103-1 (c) and (e), the  obligation is not considered to be issued in registered form and is  considered to be issued in bearer form. All purchasers of the obligation  are considered to hold an obligation in bearer form.</p><p class="depth2">Example (6). Corporation C issues obligations in bearer form. A  foreign person purchases a definitive bearer obligation and then sells  it to a United States person. At the time of the sale, the United States  person delivers the bearer obligation to Corporation C and receives an  obligation that is identical except that the obligation is registered as  to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer or its agent  and may be transferred at all times until its maturity only through a  means described in Sec. 5f.103-1(c). Under Sec. 5f.103-1(e), the  obligation is considered to be in registered form from the time it is  delivered to Corporation C until its maturity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Cross-references.
