                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Manufacturers/remanufacturers must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new locomotive, including all parts of its emission control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Warranty period. Except as specified in this paragraph, the minimum warranty period is one-third of the useful life. Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least as long as the minimum warranty periods listed in this paragraph (b) in MW-hrs of

operation (or miles for Tier 0 locomotives not equipped with MW-hr meters) and years, whichever comes first. You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the locomotive may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for the locomotive. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component. If you provide an extended warranty to individual owners for any components covered in paragraph (c) of this section for an additional charge, your emission-related warranty must cover those components for those owners to the same degree. If the locomotive does not record MW-hrs, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on years. The warranty period begins when the locomotive is placed into service, or back into service after remanufacture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase a locomotive's emissions of any regulated pollutant. This includes components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers the components you sell even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover components whose failure would not increase a locomotive's emissions of any regulated pollutant. For remanufactured locomotives, your emission-related warranty is required to cover only those parts that you supply or those parts for which you specify allowable part manufacturers. It does not need to cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the locomotive.
