                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each engine must have an independent oil system that can supply it with an appropriate quantity of oil at a temperature not above that safe for continuous operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The usable oil capacity of each system may not be less than the product of the endurance of the rotorcraft under critical operating conditions and the maximum allowable oil consumption of the engine under the same conditions, plus a suitable margin to ensure adequate circulation and cooling. Instead of a rational analysis of endurance and consumption, a usable oil capacity of one gallon for each 40 gallons of usable fuel may be used for reciprocating engine installations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oil-fuel ratios lower than those prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section may be used if they are substantiated by data on the oil consumption of the engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ability of the engine and oil cooling provisions to maintain the oil temperature at or below the maximum established value must be shown under the applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 29.1041 through 29.1049.
