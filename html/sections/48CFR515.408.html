To  provide uniformity in request under the MAS program, you should insert  the following in paragraph (b) of the provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An offer prepared and submitted in accordance with the clause at  552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multuiple Award Schedule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commercial sales practices. The Offeror shall submit information  in the format provided in this solicitation in accordance with the  instructions at Figure 515.4 of the GSA Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR  515-2), or submit information in the Offeror's own format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any additional supporting information requested by the  Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional  supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine  whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> By submission of an offer in response to this solicitation, the  Offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative  the right to examine, at any time before initial award, books, records,  documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the  pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services  proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access  does not extend to Offeror's cost or profit information of other data  relevant solely to the Offeror's determination of the prices to be  offered in the catalog or marketplace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Insert the following format for commercial sales practices in  the exhibits or attachments section of the solicitation and resulting  contract (see FAR 12.303).</p><p class="depth0">Commercial Sales Practices Format  Name of Offeror ---------- SIN(s) ------</p><p class="depth0">Note: Please refer to Clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer  (Multiple Award Schedule), for additional information concerning your  offer. Provide the following information for each SIN (or group of SINs  or SubSIN for which information is the same).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide the dollar value of sales to the general public at or  based on an established catalog or market price during the previous 12- month period or the offerors last fiscal year: $--------. State  beginning and ending of the 12 month period. Beginning -------- ending  --------.

If you currently hold a Federal Supply Schedule contract for  the SIN the total projected annual sales should be based on your  mostrecent 12 months of sales under that contract.  SIN ------------ $------------ SIN ------------ $------------ SIN ------------ $------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Based on your written discounting policies (standard commercial  sales practices in the event you do not have written discounting  policies), are the discounts and any concessions which you offer the  Government equal to or better than your best price (discount and  concessions in any combination) offered to any customer acquiring the  same items regardless of quantity or terms and conditions? YES---- NO-- -- (See definition of ``concession'' and ``discount'' in 552.212-70.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(a)</em> Based on your written discounting policies (standard  commercial sales practices in the event you do not have written  discounting policies), provide information as requested for each SIN (or  group of SINs for which the information is the same) in accordance with  the instructions at Figure 515.4, which is provided in this solicitation  for your convenience.

YES--  NO--. If YES,   explain deviations in accordance with the instructions at Figure 515.4,  which is provided in this solicitation for your convenience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If you are a dealer/reseller without significant sales to the  general public, you should provide manufacturers' information required  by paragraphs (1) through (4) above for each item/SINoffered, if the  manufacturer's sales under any resulting contract are expected to exceed  $500,000. You must also obtain written authorization from the  manufacturer(s) for Government access, at any time before award or  before agreeing to a modification, to the manufacturer's sales records  for the purpose of verifying the information submitted by the  manufacturer. The information is required in order to enable the  Government to make a determination that the offered price is fair and  reasonable. To expedite the review and processing of offers, you should  advise the manufacturer(s) of this requirement. The contracting officer  may require the information be submitted on electronic media with  commercially available spreadsheet(s). The information may be provided  by the manufacturer directly to the Government. If the manufacturer's  item(s) is being offered by multiple dealers/resellers, only one copy of  the requested information should be submitted to the Government. In  addition, you must submit the following information along with a listing  of contact information regarding each of the manufacturers whose  products and/or services are included in the offer (include the  manufacturer's name, address, the manufacturer's contact point,  telephone number, and FAX number) for each model offered by SIN:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturer's Name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturer's Part Number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dealer's/Reseller's Part Number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Product Description.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Manufacturer's List Price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Dealer's/Reseller's percentage discount from list price or net  prices.</p><p class="depth0">(End of format)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Include the instructions for completing the commercial sales  practices format in Figure 515.4 in solicitations issued under the MAS  program.</p><p class="depth0">Figure 515.4--Instructions for Commercial Sales Practices Format</p><p class="depth0">If you responded ``yes'' to question (3), on the Commercial Sales  Practices Format in paragraph (b) of this section, complete the chart in  question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who receive your best discount. If  you responded ``no'', complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your  written policies or standard sales practices for all customers or  customer categories to whom you sell at a price (discounts and  concessions in combination) that is equal to or better than the price(s)  offered to the Government under this solicitation or with which the  Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a discount which equals or  exceeds the discount(s) offered under this solicitation. Such agreement  shall be in effect on the date the offer is submitted or contain an  effective date during the proposed multiple award schedule contract  period. If your offer is lower than your price to other customers or  customers categories, you will be aligned with the customer or category  of customer that receives your best price for purposes of the Price  Reductions clause at 552.238-75. The Government expects you to provide  information required by the format in accordance with these instructions  that is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, current, accurate,  and complete as of 14 calendar days prior to its submission. You must  also disclose any changes in your price list(s), discounts and/or  discounting policies which occur after the offer is submitted, but  before the close of negotiations. If your discount practices vary by  model or product line, the discount information should be by model or  product line as appropriate. You may limit the number of models or  product lines reported to those which exceed 75% of actual historical  Government sales (commercial sales may be substituted if Government  sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).</p><p class="depth0">Column 1--Identify the Applicable Customer or Category of Customer</p><p class="depth0">A ``customer'' is any entity, except the Federal Government, which  acquires supplies or services from the Offeror. The term customer  includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value  added resellers, state and local Governments, distributors, educational  institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school  which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an  organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users.  In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a  customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer  if the Offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all  customers in the category. (Use a separate line for each customer or  category of customer.)</p><p class="depth0">Column 2--Identify the Discount</p><p class="depth0">The term ``discount'' is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212- 70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule). Indicate the best  discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard  commercial discounting practices if you do not have written discounting  policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer  identified in column 1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions  of the agreements under which the discounts are given; and   whether the agreements are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off  of other price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from  the price list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount  disclosed is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment,  quantity, etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of  discount. If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given  to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price  list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type or  title and date of each price list. The contracting officer may require  submission of these price lists. To expedite evaluation, offerors may  provide these price lists at the time of submission.</p><p class="depth0">Column 3--Identify the Quantity or Volume of Sales</p><p class="depth0">Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified  customer or category of customer must either purchase/order, per order  or within a specified period, to earn a discount indicate the time  period.</p><p class="depth0">Column 4--Indicate the FOB Delivery Term for Each Identified Customer</p><p class="depth0">See FAR 47.3 for an explanation of FOB delivery terms.</p><p class="depth0">Column 5--Indicate Concessions Regardless of Quantity Granted to the</p><p class="depth0">Identified Customer or Category of Customer</p><p class="depth0">Concessions are defined in solicitation clause 552.12-70,  Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule). If the space provided  is inadequate, the disclosure should be made on a separate sheet by  reference.</p><p class="depth0">If you respond ``yes'' to question 4(b) in the Commercial Sales  Practices Format, provide an explanation of the circumstances under  which you deviate from your written policies or standard commercial  sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices  Format and explain how often they occur. Your explanation should include  a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard  practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you  employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical  deviations may include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill  discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise  disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the  sale of sample goods to a new customer, or the sales of prototype goods  for testing purposes.</p><p class="depth0">If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial  sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices  Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer  cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable,  then you may be asked to provide additional information. The Contracting  Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made  substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent  with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales  Practices Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those  sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order  for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s)  is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is  requested the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to  limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the  reasonableness of the offered price.</p><p class="depth0">(End of figure)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insert the clause at 552.215-72, Price Adjustment--Failure to  Provide Accurate Information, in solicitations and contracts under the  MAS program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> You should use Alternate IV of FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for  Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data-- Modifications, to provide for submission of information other than cost  or pricing data for MAS contracts. To provide for uniformity in requests  under the MAS program, you should insert the following in paragraph (b)  of the clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information required by the clause at 552.243-72, Modifications  (Multiple Award Schedule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any additional supporting information requested by the  Contracting Officer.

Access  does not extent to Contractor's cost or profit information or other data  related solely to the Contractor's determination of the prices to be  offered in the catalog or marketplace.
