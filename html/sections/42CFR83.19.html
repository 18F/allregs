Sec.  83.13(c)(1) and (2), and 83.13(c)(2) and (3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A recommendation by the Board to the Secretary as to whether or not the Secretary should cancel or modify his final decision that added the class to the Cohort, based upon a review by the Board of the NIOSH analysis under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and any other relevant information considered by the Board;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An opportunity for members of the class to contest a proposed decision to cancel or modify the prior final decision that added the class to the Cohort, including a reasonable and timely effort by the Secretary to notify members of the class of this opportunity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Publication in the Federal Register of a final decision to cancel or modify the prior final decision that added the class to the Cohort.
