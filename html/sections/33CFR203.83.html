                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance deficiencies. Rehabilitation, Emergency Water, Post  Flood Response, and Advance Measures authorities may not be used to  correct deferred or deficient maintenance. Such correction must be  accomplished by, or at the expense of, local interests. This may include  restoring normal levee or dune height after subsidence, replacement of  deteriorated components such as outlet structures and pipes, removal of  debris, and new construction items such as protection against erosion.  This restriction on use of these authorities does not preclude  furnishing flood fight assistance during an emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Areas of minor damage, flood control works. Separable areas with  minor damage will be included in the maintenance program of local  interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minor completion items. Local interests should be responsible  for minor completion items, such as dressing fills, placing sod, or  seeding completed work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adequacy of requirements of local cooperation. In determining  the adequacy of the pledge of local cooperation, district/division  commanders must consider the local sponsor's performance capability,  taking into account any shortcomings in meeting prior commitments. Local  sponsors should make provisions to establish and provide resources for a  ``Contingency Fund'' to meet future maintenance requirements if apparent  inadequacies of protective works indicate maintenance costs will be  unusually high. Local sponsors should make provisions to establish and  provide resources for a ``Capital Improvement Fund'' to meet future  costs of capital   improvement projects such as replacement of culverts in levees, pump  station equipment, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligibility under other Federal programs. The Cooperation  Agreement must be worded to allow local interests to accept funding from  other Federal programs for meeting the local responsibility. For  example, removal of temporary works will be without cost under Corps  Public Law 84-99 assistance, but will not be ``at no cost to the United  States.'' Use of another Federal agency's funds is contingent upon that  agency providing the Corps written assurance that such usage does not  violate any existing laws or rules concerning the usage or expenditure  of such funds.</p>
