                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition of qualified resident. A foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in effect if, for the taxable year, the foreign corporation is a resident of that country (within the meaning of such treaty) and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section (relating to stock ownership and base erosion);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section (relating to publicly-traded corporations);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section (relating to the conduct of an active trade or business); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Obtains a ruling as provided in paragraph (f) of this section that it shall be treated as a qualified resident of its country of residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Stock ownership requirement--(1) General rule--(i) Ownership by qualifying shareholders. A foreign corporation satisfies the stock ownership requirement of this paragraph (b) for the taxable year if more than 50 percent of its stock (by value) is beneficially owned (or is treated as beneficially owned by reason of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) during at least half of the number of days in the foreign corporation's taxable year by one or more qualifying shareholders.

A person shall be treated as a qualifying shareholder only if such person meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and is either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An individual who is either a resident of the foreign country of which the foreign corporation is a resident or a citizen or resident of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The government of the country of which the foreign corporation is a resident (or a political subdivision or local authority of such country), or the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or a political subdivision or local authority of a State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A corporation that is a resident of the foreign country of which the foreign corporation is a resident and whose stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) in that country or the United States or a domestic corporation whose stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A not-for profit organization described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section that is not a pension fund as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A) of this section and that is organized under the laws of the foreign country of which the foreign corporation is a resident or the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A beneficiary of certain pension funds (as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A) of this section) administered in or by the country in which the foreign corporation is a resident to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
Beneficial owners of an association taxable as a corporation shall be treated as shareholders of such association for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1). If stock of a foreign corporation is owned by a corporation that is treated as a qualifying shareholder under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, such stock shall not also be treated as owned, directly or indirectly, by any qualifying shareholders of such corporation for

purposes of this paragraph (b). Notwithstanding the above, a foreign corporation will not be treated as a qualified resident unless it obtains the documentation described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to show that the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1)(i) have been met and maintains the documentation as provided in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. See also paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, which treats certain publicly-traded classes of stock as owned by qualifying shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules relating to qualifying shareholders. For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stock owned on any day shall be taken into account only if the beneficial owner is a qualifying shareholder on that day or, in the case of a corporation or not-for-profit organization that is a qualifying shareholder under paragraph (b)(1)(i) (C) or (D) of this section, for a one-year period that includes such day; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An individual, corporation or not-for-profit organization is a resident of a foreign country if it is a resident of that country for purposes of the income tax treaty between the United States and that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Publicly-traded class of stock treated as owned by qualifying shareholders. A class of stock of a foreign corporation shall be treated as owned by qualifying shareholders if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The class of stock is listed on an established securities market in the United States or in the country of residence of the foreign corporation seeking qualified resident status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The class of stock is primarily and regularly traded on such market (within the meaning of paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section, applied as if the class of stock were the sole class of stock relied on to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A)).
For purposes of this paragraph (b), stock in such class shall not also be treated as owned by any qualifying shareholders who own such stock, either directly or indirectly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for not-for-profit organizations. A not-for-profit organization is described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section if it meets the following requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is a corporation, association taxable as a corporation, trust, fund, foundation, league or other entity operated exclusively for religious, charitable, educational, or recreational purposes, and it is not organized for profit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is generally exempt from tax in its country of organization by virtue of its not-for-profit status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> More than 50 percent of its annual support is expended on behalf of persons described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section or on qualified residents of the country in which the organization is organized; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> More than 50 percent of its annual support is derived from persons described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) (A) through (E) of this section or from persons who are qualified residents of the country in which the organization is organized.
For purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, a not-for-profit organization may rely on the addresses of record of its individual beneficiaries and supporters to determine if such persons are resident in the country in which the not-for-profit organization is organized, provided that the addresses of record are not nonresidential addresses such as a post office box or in care of a financial intermediary, and the officers, directors or administrators of the organization do not know or have reason to know that the individual beneficiaries or supporters do not reside at that address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for determining constructive ownership--(i) General rules for attribution. For purposes of this section, stock owned by a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or mutual insurance company or similar entity shall be treated as owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, grantors or other interest holders as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section. The proportionate interest rules of this paragraph (b)(2) shall apply successively upward through a chain of ownership, and a person's proportionate interest shall be computed for the relevant days or period that is taken into account in determining whether a foreign corporation is a qualified resident. Except as

otherwise provided, stock treated as owned by a person by reason of this paragraph (b)(2) shall, for purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(2), be treated as actually owned by such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rules for attribution. For purposes of this section, stock owned by a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or mutual insurance company or similar entity shall be treated as owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, grantors or other interest holders as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section. The proportionate interest rules of this paragraph (b)(2) shall apply successively upward through a chain of ownership, and a person's proportionate interest shall be computed for the relevant days or period that is taken into account in determining whether a foreign corporation is a qualified resident. Except as

otherwise provided, stock treated as owned by a person by reason of this paragraph (b)(2) shall, for purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(2), be treated as actually owned by such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnerships. A partner shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a partnership in proportion to the least of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of the partnership's dividend income from the stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of gain from disposition of the stock by the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The partner's percentage distributive share of the stock (or proceeds from the disposition of the stock) upon liquidation of the partnership.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), however, all qualifying shareholders that are partners of a partnership shall be treated as one partner. Thus, the percentage distributive shares of dividend income, gain and liquidation rights of all qualifying shareholders that are partners in a partnership are aggregated prior to determining the least of the three percentages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trusts and estates--(A) Beneficiaries. In general, a person shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust or estate in proportion to the person's actuarial interest in the trust or estate, as provided in section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), except that an income beneficiary's actuarial interest in the trust will be determined as if the trust's only asset were the stock. The interest of a remainder beneficiary in stock will be equal to 100 percent minus the sum of the percentages of any interest in the stock held by income beneficiaries. The ownership of an interest in stock owned by a trust shall not be attributed to any beneficiary whose interest cannot be determined under the preceding sentence, and any such interest, to the extent not attributed by reason of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), shall not be considered owned by a beneficiary unless all potential beneficiaries with respect to the stock are qualifying shareholders. In addition, a beneficiary's actuarial interest will be treated as zero to extent that a grantor is treated as owning the stock under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. A substantially separate and independent share of a trust, within the meaning of section 663(c), shall be treated as a separate trust for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), provided that payment of income, accumulated income or corpus of a share of one beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) cannot affect the proportionate share of income, accumulated income or corpus of another beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Beneficiaries. In general, a person shall be treated as having an interest in stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust or estate in proportion to the person's actuarial interest in the trust or estate, as provided in section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), except that an income beneficiary's actuarial interest in the trust will be determined as if the trust's only asset were the stock. The interest of a remainder beneficiary in stock will be equal to 100 percent minus the sum of the percentages of any interest in the stock held by income beneficiaries. The ownership of an interest in stock owned by a trust shall not be attributed to any beneficiary whose interest cannot be determined under the preceding sentence, and any such interest, to the extent not attributed by reason of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), shall not be considered owned by a beneficiary unless all potential beneficiaries with respect to the stock are qualifying shareholders. In addition, a beneficiary's actuarial interest will be treated as zero to extent that a grantor is treated as owning the stock under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. A substantially separate and independent share of a trust, within the meaning of section 663(c), shall be treated as a separate trust for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), provided that payment of income, accumulated income or corpus of a share of one beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) cannot affect the proportionate share of income, accumulated income or corpus of another beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Grantor trusts. A person is treated as the owner of stock of a foreign corporation owned by a trust to the extent that the stock is included in the portion of the trust that is treated as owned by the person under sections 671 to 679 (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Corporations that issue stock. A shareholder of a corporation that issues stock shall be treated as owning stock of a foreign corporation that is owned by such corporation on any day in a proportion that equals the value of the stock owned by such shareholder to the value of all stock of such corporation. If there is an agreement, express or implied, that a shareholder of a corporation will not receive distributions from the earnings of stock owned by the corporation, the shareholder will not be treated as owning that stock owned by the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Mutual insurance companies and similar entities. Stock held by a mutual insurance company, mutual savings bank, or similar entity (including an association taxable as a corporation that does not issue stock interests) shall be considered owned proportionately by the policy holders, depositors, or other owners in the same proportion that such persons share in the surplus of such entity upon liquidation or dissolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Pension funds. See paragraphs (b)(8) (ii) and (iii) of this section for the attribution of stock owned by a pension fund (as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A)) to beneficiaries of the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Stock held solely by qualifying shareholders through a partnership. A and B,

residents of country X, are qualifying shareholders, within the meaning of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) (A) through (E) of this section, and the sole partners of partnership P. P's only asset is the stock of foreign corporation Z, a country X corporation seeking qualified resident status under this section. A's distributive share of P's income and gain on the disposition of P's assets is 80 percent, but A's distributive share of P's assets (or the proceeds therefrom) on P's liquidation is 20 percent. B's distributive share of P's income and gain is 20 percent and B is entitled to 80 percent of the assets (or proceeds therefrom) on P's liquidation. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, A and B will be treated as a single partner owning in the aggregate 100 percent of the stock of Z owned by P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Stock held by both qualifying and non-qualifying shareholders through a partnership. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that C, an individual who is not a qualifying shareholder, is also a partner in P and that C's distributive share of P's income is 60 percent. The distributive shares of A and B are the same as in Example 1 except that A's distributive share of income is 20 percent. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, A and B will be treated as a single partner owning in the aggregate 40 percent of the stock of Z owned by P (i.e., the least of A and B's aggregate distributive shares of dividend income (40 percent), gain (100 percent), and liquidation rights (100 percent) with respect to the Z stock).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Stock held through tiered partnerships. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that P does not own the stock of Z directly, but rather is a partner in partnership P1, which owns the stock of Z. Assume that P's distributive share of the dividend income, gain and liquidation rights with respect to the Z stock held by P1 is 40 percent. Assume that of the remaining partners of P1 only D is a qualifying shareholder. D's distributive share of P1's dividend income and gain is 15 percent; D's distributive share of P1's assets on liquidation is 25 percent. Under the attribution rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, A and B, treated as a single partner, will own 40 percent of the Z stock owned by P1 (100 percent X 40 percent) and D will be treated as owning 15 percent of the Z stock owned by P1 (the least of D's dividend income (15 percent), gain (15 percent), and liquidation rights (25 percent) with respect to the Z stock). Thus, 55 percent of the Z stock owned by P1 is treated as owned by qualifying shareholders under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Required documentation--(i) Ownership statements, certificates of residency and intermediary ownership statements. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) and paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a person shall only be treated as a qualifying shareholder of a foreign corporation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ownership statements, certificates of residency and intermediary ownership statements. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) and paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a person shall only be treated as a qualifying shareholder of a foreign corporation if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the relevant period, the person completes an ownership statement described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and, in the case of an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, also obtains a certificate of residency described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a person owning stock in the foreign corporation indirectly through one or more intermediaries (including mere legal owners or recordholders acting as nominees), each intermediary completes an intermediary ownership statement described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Such ownership statements and certificates of residency are received by the foreign corporation on or before the earlier of the date it files its income tax return for the taxable year to which the statements relate or the due date (including extensions) for filing such return or, in the case of a foreign corporation claiming treaty benefits under Sec. 1.884-4(b)(8) (i) or (ii) (relating to branch interest) on or before the date on which such interest is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substitution of intermediary verification statement for ownership statements and certificates of residency. If a qualifying shareholder owns stock through an intermediary that is either a domestic corporation, a resident of the United States, or a resident (for treaty purposes) of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in effect, the intermediary may provide an intermediary verification statement (as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) in place of any relevant ownership statements and certificates of residency from qualifying shareholders, and in place of intermediary ownership statements (or, where applicable, intermediary verification statements) from all intermediaries standing in the chain of ownership between the qualifying shareholders and the intermediary issuing the intermediary verification statement. An intermediary verification statement generally certifies that the verifying

intermediary holds the documentation described in the preceding sentence and agrees to make it available to the District Director on request. Such intermediary verification statements, along with an intermediary ownership statement from the verifying intermediary, must be received by the foreign corporation on or before the earlier of the date if files its income tax return for the taxable year to which the statements relate or the due date (including extensions) for filing such return. An indirect owner of a foreign corporation is thus treated as a qualifying shareholder of a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation receives, on or before the time specified above, an intermediary verification statement and an intermediary ownership statement from the verifying intermediary and an intermediary ownership statement from all intermediaries standing in the chain of the verifying intermediary's ownership of its interest in the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for registered shareholders of widely-held corporations. An ownership statement and a certificate of residency shall not be required in the case of an individual who is a shareholder of record of a corporation that has at least 250 shareholders if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual owns less than one percent of the stock (by value) (applying the attribution rules of section 318) of the corporation at all times during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual's address of record is in the corporation's country of residence and is not a nonresidential address such as a post office box or in care of a financial intermediary or stock transfer agent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The officers and directors of the corporation do not know or have reason to know that the individual does not reside at that address.
The rule in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) may also be applied with respect to individual owners of mutual insurance companies, mutual savings banks or similar entities, provided that the same conditions set forth in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) are met with respect to such individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for pension funds. See paragraphs (b)(8) (ii) through (v) of this section for special documentation rules applicable to pension funds (as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reasonable cause exception. If a foreign corporation does not obtain the documentation described in this paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(8) of this section in a timely manner but is able to show prior to notification of an examination of the return for the taxable year that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, the foreign corporation may perfect the documentation after the deadlines specified in this paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(8) of this section. It may make such a showing by providing a written statement to the District Director having jurisdiction over the taxpayer's return or the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International), as applicable, setting forth the reasons for the failure to obtain the documentation in a timely manner and describing the documentation that was received after the deadline had passed. Whether a failure to obtain the documentation in a timely manner was due to reasonable cause shall be determined by the District Director or the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International), as applicable, under all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ownership statements from qualifying shareholders--(i) Ownership statements from individuals. An ownership statement from an individual is a written statement signed by the individual under penalties of perjury stating--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ownership statements from individuals. An ownership statement from an individual is a written statement signed by the individual under penalties of perjury stating--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent address, and country of residence of the individual and, if the individual was not a resident of the country for the entire taxable year of the foreign corporation seeking qualified resident status, the period during which it was a resident of the foreign corporation's country of residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the individual is a direct beneficial owner of stock in the foreign corporation, the name of the corporation, the number of shares in each class of stock of the corporation that are so owned, and the period of time during the taxable year of the foreign corporation during which the individual owned the stock (or, in the case of an association taxable as a corporation, the

amount and nature of the owner's interest in such association);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the individual directly owns an interest in a corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other intermediary that owns (directly or indirectly) stock in the foreign corporation, the name of the intermediary, the number and class of shares or amount and nature of the interest of the individual in such intermediary (that is relevant for purposes of attributing ownership in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and the period of time during the taxable year of the foreign corporation during which the individual held such interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> To the extent known by the individual, a description of the chain of ownership through which the individual owns stock in the foreign corporation, including the name and address of each intermediary standing between the intermediary described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section and the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ownership statements from governments. An ownership statement from a government that is a qualifying shareholder is a written statement signed by either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An official of the governmental authority, agency or office that has supervisory authority with respect to the government's ownership interest who is authorized to sign such a statement on behalf of the authority, agency or office; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The competent authority of the foreign country (as defined in the income tax treaty between the United States and the foreign country).
Such statement shall provide the title of the official signing the statement and the name and address of the government agency, and shall provide the information described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section (substituting ``government'' for ``individual'') with respect to the government's direct or indirect ownership of stock in the foreign corporation seeking qualified resident status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ownership statements from publicly-traded corporations. An ownership statement from a corporation that is a qualifying shareholder under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section is a written statement signed by a person authorized to sign a tax return on behalf of the corporation under penalties of perjury stating--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent address, and principal place of business of the corporation (if different from its permanent address);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section (substituting ``corporation'' for ``individual''); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That the corporation's stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities exchange (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) in the United States or its country of residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ownership statements from not-for-profit organizations. An ownership statement from a not-for-profit organization (other than a pension fund as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A) of this section) is a written statement signed by a person authorized to sign a tax return on behalf of the organization under penalties of perjury stating--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent address, and principal location of the activities of the organization (if different from its permanent address);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section (substituting ``not-for-profit organization'' for ``individual'') with respect to the not-for-profit organization's direct or indirect ownership of stock in the foreign corporation seeking qualified resident status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That the not-for-profit organization satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ownership through a nominee. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4) and paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a person who owns either stock in a foreign corporation seeking qualified resident status or an interest in an intermediary described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section through a nominee shall be treated as owning such stock or interest directly and must, therefore, provide the information described in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable. Such person must also provide the name and address of the nominee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certificate of residency. A certificate of residency must be signed by the relevant authorities (as described below) of the country of residence of

the individual shareholder and must state that the individual is a resident of that country for purposes of its income tax laws or, if the authorities do not customarily make such a determination, that the individual has filed a tax return claiming resident status and subjecting the individual's income to tax on a resident basis for the taxable year or period that ends with or within the taxable year for which the corporation is seeking qualified resident status. In the case of an individual who is not legally required to file a tax return in his or her country of residence or in any other country, a certificate of residency of a parent or guardian residing at such individual's address shall be considered sufficient to meet that individual's obligation under this paragraph (b)(5).

If stock of a foreign corporation fails the 80 percent requirement of paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section, but a class of such stock meets the trading requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section, such class of stock may be taken into account under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section as owned by qualifying shareholders for purposes of meeting the ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Classes of stock traded on a domestic established securities market treated as meeting trading requirements.
