                            <p class="depth0">This section covers the purchase of microwave and power line carrier  communications systems, load control, and supervisory control and data  acquisition (SCADA) systems. Mobile radio systems are covered as general  plant materials in Sec. 1726.175.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Power line carrier systems. Power line carrier equipment will  frequently be purchased as part of a substation and will be included in  the complete substation plans and specifications. When purchased in this  manner, the requirements of subpart C of this part, Substation and  Transmission Facilities, will apply. If obtained under a contract for  only a power line carrier system, the requirements of paragraph (b) of  this section apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Load control systems, communications systems, and SCADA  systems--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contract forms. The borrower must use RUS Form 786,  Electric System Communication and Control Equipment Contract. This form  may be modified to be a ``purchase only'' contract form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procurement procedures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is the responsibility of each  borrower to determine the procurement method that best meets its needs  to award contracts not requiring RUS approval in amounts of up to a  cumulative total of $750,000 or one percent of NUP (not to exceed  $5,000,000), whichever is greater, per calendar year of communications  and control facilities construction (including minor modifications or  improvements), exclusive of the cost of owner furnished materials and  equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower must use multiparty negotiation for all other  communications and control facilities contract construction, including  all contracts requiring RUS approval. The amount of contracts bid using  the multiparty negotiation procedure do not apply to the cumulative  total stipulated in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An amendment which increases the scope by adding a project is  not considered competitively bid, therefore, the amount of that  amendment does apply to the cumulative total stipulated in paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contract approval. Individual contracts in amounts of $750,000  or more or one percent of NUP (not to exceed $1,500,000 for distribution  borrowers or $4,500,000 for power supply borrowers), whichever is  greater, exclusive of the cost of owner furnished materials and   equipment, are subject to RUS approval.
