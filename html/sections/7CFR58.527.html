The cottage cheese shall possess a mild pleasing flavor,  similar to fresh whole milk or light cream and may possess the delicate  flavor and aroma of a good lactic starter.

The texture shall be smooth and velvety and shall not be  mealy, crumbly, pasty, sticky, mushy, watery, rubbery or slimy or  possess any other objectionable characteristics of body and texture.  Small curd style (cut with \1/4\ inch knives) should have curd particles  approximately \1/4\ inch or less in size. Large curd style (cut with  knives over \1/4\ inch) should have curd particles approximately \3/8\  inch or more in size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Color and appearance.

The creamed cottage cheese  shall be uniformly mixed with the cream or dressing properly absorbed or  adhering to the curd so as to prevent excessive drainage.</p>
