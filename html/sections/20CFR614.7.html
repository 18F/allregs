                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicable State Law. The provisions of the applicable State law concerning the right of appeal and fair hearing from a determination or redetermination of entitlement to State unemployment compensation (exclusive of findings which are final and conclusive under Sec.  614.25) shall apply to determinations and redeterminations of eligibility for or entitlement to UCX and waiting period credit. Any such determination or redetermination shall be subject to appeal and review only in the manner and to the extent provided in the applicable State law with respect to determinations and redeterminations of entitlement to State unemployment compensation.
(Section 614.24 governs appeals of findings of the Veterans Administration)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rights of appeal and fair hearing. The provisions on right of appeal and opportunity for a fair hearing with respect to claims for UCX shall be consistent with this part and with sections 303(a)(1) and 303(a)(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1) and 503(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Promptness on appeals. (1) Decisions on appeals under the UCX Program shall accord with the Secretary's ``Standard for Appeals Promptness--Unemployment Compensation'' in part 650 of this chapter, and with Sec.  614.1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any provision of an applicable State law for advancement or priority of unemployment compensation cases on judicial calendars, or otherwise intended to provide for the prompt payment of unemployment compensation when due, shall apply to proceedings involving claims for UCX.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Appeal and review by Federal military agency. If a Federal military agency believes that a State agency's determination or redetermination of an individual's eligibility for or entitlement to UCX is incorrect, the Federal military agency may seek appeal and review of such determination or redetermination in the same manner as an interested employer may seek appeal and review under the applicable State law.</p>
