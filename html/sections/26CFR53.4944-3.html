                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of section 4944 and Sec. Sec.  53.4944-1 through 53.4944-6, a ``program-related investment'' shall not  be classified as an investment which jeopardizes the carrying out of the  exempt purposes of a private foundation. A program-related investment is  an investment which possesses the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The primary purpose of the investment is to accomplish one or  more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No significant purpose of the investment is the production of  income or the appreciation of property; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No purpose of the investment is to accomplish one or more of  the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(D).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An investment shall be considered as made primarily to  accomplish one or more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B)  if it significantly furthers the accomplishment of the private  foundation's exempt activities and if the investment would not have been  made but for such relationship between the investment and the  accomplishment of the foundation's exempt activities. For purposes of  section 4944 and Sec. Sec. 53.4944-1 through 53.4944-6, the term  purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) shall be treated as including  purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) whether or not carried out by  organizations described in section 170(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An investment in an activity described in section 4942(j)(5)(B)  and the regulations thereunder shall be considered, for purposes of this  paragraph, as made primarily to accomplish one or more of the purposes  described in section 170(c)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether a significant purpose of an investment  is the production of income or the appreciation of property, it shall be  relevant whether investors solely engaged in the investment for profit  would be likely to make the investment on the same terms as the private  foundation. However, the fact that an investment produces significant  income or capital appreciation shall not, in the absence of other  factors, be conclusive evidence of a significant purpose involving the  production of income or the appreciation of property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An investment shall not be considered as made to accomplish one  or more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(D) if the  recipient of the investment appears before, or communicates to, any  legislative body with respect to legislation or proposed legislation of  direct interest to such recipient, provided that the expense of engaging  in such activities would qualify as a deduction under section 162.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Once it has been determined that an investment is ``program- related'' it shall not cease to qualify as a ``program-related  investment'' provided that changes, if any, in the form or terms of the  investment are made primarily for exempt purposes and not for any  significant purpose involving the production of income or the  appreciation of property. A change made in the form or terms of a  program-related investment for the prudent protection of the  foundation's investment shall not ordinarily cause the investment to  cease to qualify as program-related. Under certain conditions, a  program-related investment may cease to be program-related because of a  critical change in circumstances, as, for example, where it is serving  an illegal purpose or the private purpose of the foundation or its  managers. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an investment which  ceases to be program-related because of a critical change in  circumstances shall in no event subject the foundation making the  investment to the tax imposed by section 4944(a)(1) before the 30th day  after the date on   which such foundation (or any of its managers) has actual knowledge of  such critical change in circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a private foundation changes the form or terms of an  investment, and if, as a result of the application of subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph, such investment no longer qualifies as program- related, the determination whether the investment jeopardizes the  carrying out of exempt purposes shall be made pursuant to the provisions  of Sec. 53.4944-1(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a small business enterprise located in a  deteriorated urban area and owned by members of an economically  disadvantaged minority group. Conventional sources of funds are  unwilling or unable to provide funds to X on terms it considers  economically feasible. Y, a private foundation, makes a loan to X  bearing interest below the market rate for commercial loans of  comparable risk. Y's primary purpose for making the loan is to encourage  the economic development of such minority groups. The loan has no  significant purpose involving the production of income or the  appreciation of property. The loan significantly furthers the  accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and would not have been made but  for such relationship between the loan and Y's exempt activities.  Accordingly, the loan is a program-related investment even though Y may  earn income from the investment in an amount comparable to or higher  than earnings from conventional portfolio investments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in Example (1), except that  after the date of execution of the loan Y extends the due date of the  loan. The extension is granted in order to permit X to achieve greater  financial stability before it is required to repay the loan. Since the  change in the terms of the loan is made primarily for exempt purposes  and not for any significant purpose involving the production of income  or the appreciation of property, the loan shall continue to qualify as a  program-related investment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. X is a small business enterprise located in a  deteriorated urban area and owned by members of an economically  disadvantaged minority group. Conventional sources of funds are  unwilling to provide funds to X at reasonable interest rates unless it  increases the amount of its equity capital. Consequently, Y, a private  foundation, purchases shares of X's common stock. Y's primary purpose in  purchasing the stock is to encourage the economic development of such  minority group, and no significant purpose involves the production of  income or the appreciation of property. The investment significantly  furthers the accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and would not have  been made but for such relationship between the investment and Y's  exempt activities. Accordingly, the purchase of the common stock is a  program-related investment, even though Y may realize a profit if X is  successful and the common stock appreciates in value.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. X is a business enterprise which is not owned by low- income persons or minority group members, but the continued operation of  X is important to the economic well-being of a deteriorated urban area  because X employes a substantial number of low-income persons from such  area. Conventional sources of funds are unwilling or unable to provide  funds to X at reasonable interest rates. Y, a private foundation, makes  a loan to X at an interest rate below the market rate for commercial  loans of comparable risk. The loan is made pursuant to a program run by  Y to assist low-income persons by providing increased economic  opportunities and to prevent community deterioration. No significant  purpose of the loan involves the production of income or the  appreciation of property. The investment significantly furthers the  accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and would not have been made but  for such relationship between the loan and Y's exempt activities.  Accordingly, the loan is a program-related investment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. X is a business enterprise which is financially secure  and the stock of which is listed and traded on a national exchange. Y, a  private foundation, makes a loan to X at an interest rate below the  market rate in order to induce X to establish a new plant in a  deteriorated urban area which, because of the high risks involved, X  would be unwilling to establish absent such inducement. The loan is made  pursuant to a program run by Y to enhance the economic development of  the area by, for example, providing employment opportunities for low- income persons at the new plant, and no significant purpose involves the  production of income or the appreciation of property. The loan  significantly furthers the accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and  would not have been made but for such relationship between the loan and  Y's exempt activities. Accordingly, even though X is large and  established, the investment is program-related.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. X is a business enterprise which is owned by a nonprofit  community development corporation. When fully operational, X will market  agricultural products, thereby providing a marketing outlet for low- income farmers in a depressed rural area. Y, a private foundation, makes  a loan to X bearing interest at a rate less than the rate charged by  financial institutions which have agreed to lend funds to X if Y makes  the loan. The   loan is made pursuant to a program run by Y to encourage economic  redevelopment of depressed areas, and no significant purpose involves  the production of income or the appreciation of property. The loan  significantly furthers the accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and  would not have been made but for such relationship between the loan and  Y's exempt activities. Accordingly, the loan is a program-related  investment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. X, a private foundation, invests $100,000 in the common  stock of corporation M. The dividends received from such investment are  later applied by X in furtherance of its exempt purposes. Although there  is a relationship between the return on the investment and the  accomplishment of X's exempt activities, there is no relationship  between the investment per se and such accomplishment. Therefore, the  investment cannot be considered as made primarily to accomplish one or  more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) and cannot  qualify as program-related.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. S, a private foundation, makes an investment in T, a  business corporation, which qualifies as a program-related investment  under section 4944(c) at the time that it is made. All of T's voting  stock is owned by S. T experiences financial and management problems  which, in the judgment of the foundation, require changes in management,  in financial structure or in the form of the investment. The following  three methods of resolving the problems appear feasible to S, but each  of the three methods would result in reduction of the exempt purposes  for which the program-related investment was initially made:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sale of stock or assets. The foundation sells its stock to an  unrelated person. Payment is made in part at the time of sale; the  balance is payable over an extended term of years with interest on the  amount outstanding. The foundation receives a purchase-money mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lease. The corporation leases its assets for a term of years to  an unrelated person, with an option in the lessee to buy the assets. If  the option is exercised, the terms of payment are to be similar to those  described in (a) of this example.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Management contract. The corporation enters into a management  contract which gives broad operating authority to one or more unrelated  persons for a term of years. The foundation and the unrelated persons  are obligated to contribute toward working capital requirements. The  unrelated persons will be compensated by a fixed fee or a share of  profits, and they will receive an option to buy the stock held by S or  the assets of the corporation. If the option is exercised, the terms of  payment are to be similar to those described in (a) of this example.   Each of the three methods involves a change in the form or terms of a  program-related investment for the prudent protection of the  foundation's investment. Thus, under Sec. 53.4944-3(a)(3)(i), none of  the three transactions (nor any debt instruments or other obligations  held by S as a result of engaging in one of these transactions) would  cause the investment to cease to qualify as program-related.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. X is a socially and economically disadvantaged  individual. Y, a private foundation, makes an interest-free loan to X  for the primary purpose of enabling X to attend college. The loan has no  significant purpose involving the production of income or the  appreciation of property. The loan significantly furthers the  accomplishment of Y's exempt activities and would not have been made but  for such relationship between the loan and Y's exempt activities.  Accordingly, the loan is a program-related investment.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Y, a private foundation, makes a high-risk investment in  low-income housing, the indebtedness with respect to which is insured by  the Federal Housing Administration. Y's primary purpose in making the  investment is to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, and construction  of housing for low-income persons. The investment has no significant  purpose involving the production of income or the appreciation of  property. The investment significantly furthers the accomplishment of  Y's exempt activities and would not have been made but for such  relationship between the investment and Y's exempt activities.  Accordingly, the investment is program-related.</p>
