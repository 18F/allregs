                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the EAJA in  this subpart), provides for the award of attorney's fees and other  expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain  administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the  Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over  the Commission, unless the Commission's position in the proceeding was  substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust,  or when the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of the  decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when compared  with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case,  unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise  acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The  rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the  proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards,  and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make  them.  [47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39898, July 31, 1996]</p>
