The  permanent nameplate of an electric motor for which standards are  prescribed in Sec. 431.25 must be marked clearly with the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The motor's nominal full load efficiency (as of the date of  manufacture), derived from the motor's average full load efficiency as  determined pursuant to this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A Compliance Certification number (``CC number'') supplied by  DOE to the manufacturer or private labeler, pursuant to Sec. 431.36(f),  and applicable to that motor. Such CC number must be on the nameplate of  a motor beginning 90 days after either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer or private labeler has received the number upon  submitting a Compliance Certification covering that motor, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The expiration of 21 days from DOE's receipt of a Compliance  Certification covering that motor, if the manufacturer or private  labeler has not been advised by DOE that the Compliance Certification  fails to satisfy Sec. 431.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display of required information. All orientation, spacing, type  sizes, type faces, and line widths to display this required information  shall be the same as or similar to the display of the other performance  data on the motor's permanent nameplate. The nominal full-load  efficiency shall be identified either by the term ``Nominal Efficiency''  or ``Nom. Eff.'' or by the terms specified in paragraph 12.58.2 of NEMA  MG1-2009, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15) as for example  ``NEMA Nom. Eff. ----.'' The Compliance Certification number issued  pursuant to Sec. 431.36 shall be in the form ``CC ----.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional display. The permanent nameplate of an electric motor,  a separate plate, or decalcomania, may be marked with the encircled  lower case letters ``ee'', for example, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.000   or with some comparable designation or logo, if the motor meets the  applicable standard prescribed in Sec. 431.25, as determined pursuant  to this subpart, and is covered by a Compliance Certification that  satisfies Sec. 431.36.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure of efficiency information in marketing materials. (1)  The same information that must appear on an electric motor's permanent  nameplate pursuant to paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, shall be  prominently displayed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On each page of a catalog that lists the motor; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In other materials used to market the motor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ``ee'' logo, or other similar logo or designations, may also  be used in catalogs and other materials to the same extent they may be  used on labels under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
