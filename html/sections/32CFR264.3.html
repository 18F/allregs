The agreements, which are published in the Treaties and Other  International Act Series, are basically similar in substance but are not  identical. Under the agreements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each government undertakes to facilitate the interchange of  privately owned patent rights and of technical information through the  medium of commercial relationships, to the extent permitted by the laws  and security requirements of the contracting governments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When technical information is supplied by one government to the  other for information only, the recipient government undertakes to treat  the information as disclosed in confidence and to use its best endeavors  to ensure that the information is not dealt with in any manner likely to  prejudice the rights of the owner to obtain patent or similar statutory  protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When technical information supplied by one government to the  other discloses an invention which is the subject of a patent or patent  application held in secrecy in the country of origin, the recipient  government undertakes to accord similar treatment to a corresponding  patent application filed in that country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When privately owned technical information is released by one  government to the other and the recipient government uses or disclosed  the information, the owner shall, subject to the extent that the owner  may be entitled thereto under the applicable law and subject to  arrangements between the contracting governments regarding the  assumption as between them of liability for compensation, receive  prompt, just and effective compensation for such use and for any damages  resulting from such use or disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each government is entitled to use for defense purposes without  cost any invention which the other government (including government  corporations) owns or to which it has the right to grant a license to  use, except to the extent that there may be liability to any private  owner of an interest in the invention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each of these agreements establishes a Technical Property  Committee consisting of a representative of each contracting government,  whose function it is to consider and make recommendations to the  contracting governments on all matters relating to the subject of the  agreement and to assist where appropriate in the negotiation of  commercial or other agreements for the use of patent rights and  technical information in the military assistance program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Patent Advisor assigned to the Defense Staff of the U.S.  Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Regional  Organizations (USRO), Paris, France, is the United States representative  to the Technical Property Committees in Europe. The J-4, Hq. United  States Forces Japan, Tokyo, Japan is the United States representative to  the United States-Japanese Technical Property Committee.

The appropriate  representative should be consulted on all problems dealing with patent  rights, technical information and related matters under the agreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These representatives receive policy guidance from the  Department of Defense. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for  International Security Affairs is responsible within the Department of  Defense for transmitting such policy guidance through appropriate  channels. Guidance transmitted for the United States representative in  Europe shall be forwarded to the Defense Advisor, USRO; guidance  transmitted for the United States representative in Japan shall be  transmitted to the Commanding General, United States Forces Japan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Department of Defense problems arising in the United States in  connection with the interchange of patent rights and privately owned  technical   information should be referred to the patent activity of the appropriate  Military Department.
