                                Sec. 246.201  Residential materials recovery.

Sec. 246.201-1  Requirement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Separation of used newspapers at the source of residential generation in conjunction with separate collection shall be carried out at all facilities in which more than 500 families reside, and the newspapers shall be sold for the purpose of recycling.



Sec. 246.201-2  Recommended procedures: Newsprint recovery from smallerresidential facilities.</p><p class="depth0">The recovery of newsprint generated by residential facilities of less than 500 families should be investigated in conformance with the following recom mended procedures and imple mented where feasible.


Sec. 246.201-3  Recommended procedures: Glass, can, and mixed paper separation.</p><p class="depth0">In areas where markets are available, it is recommended that glass, cans, and mixed paper be separated at the source of generation and separately collected for the purpose of recycling.


Sec. 246.201-4  Recommended procedures: Market study.</p><p class="depth0">An investigation of markets should be made for each material by the organization responsible for sale of recyclable materials in each agency and should include at a minimum:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identifying potential purchasers of the recovered material through standard market research techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directly contacting buyers and determining the buyers' quality specifications, potential transportation agreements and any minimum quantity criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining the prices that the buyer will pay for the recovered material and the willingness of the buyer to sign a contract for the purchase of the material at guaranteed minimum prices.


Sec. 246.201-5  Recommended procedures: Methods of separation and collection.</p><p class="depth0">Following separation within the home, any of the following methods of collection may be used:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Materials may be placed at the curbside by the resident and may be collected from each household using separate trucks or compartmentalized vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For multi-family dwellings, separated materials may be placed in bulk containers located outside of the building and collected by trucks dispatched to collect recyclables.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection stations may be set up at convenient locations to which residents bring recyclables. These stations should provide separate bulk containers for each item to be recycled. The size and type of container will depend on the volume and type of material collected, the method of transportation to be used in hauling the materials to market and the frequency of removal.


Sec. 246.201-6  Recommended procedures: Transportation to market.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation to market may be supplied by the facility or the community generating the waste, by a private hauler, or by the purchaser.


Sec. 246.201-7  Recommended procedures: Cost analysis.</p><p class="depth2">After potential markets have been located (but prior to initiation of formal bidding procedures), preliminary determinations of various separation methods, storage and transportation costs have been made, and estimated tonnages of both recoverable materials and residual solid waste have been established, an analysis should be conducted which compares the costs of the present waste collection and disposal system with the proposed segregated systems. At a minimum this study should include all capital, operating and overhead costs and take into account credits for revenue from paper sales and savings from diverting recycled materials from disposal. Potential costs to upgrade collection and disposal practices to comply with EPA's Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Wastes (40 CFR part 243) and Thermal Processing and Land Disposal Guidelines (40 CFR parts 240 and 241) should be included in the analysis. In formulating a separate collection system and evaluating its costs, every effort should be made to use idle equipment and underutilized collection manpower to reduce separate collection costs. This cost analysis should enable the facility to determine the most cost effective method if implementing the requirements of this part.


Sec. 246.201-8  Recommended procedures: Contracts.</p><p class="depth2">Formal bids should be requested for purchase of the recovered materials,

such bids being solicited in conformance with bidding procedures established for the responsible jurisdiction. Contracts should include the buyer's quality specifications, quantity and transportation agreements, a guarantee that the material will be accepted for one year or more and a guaranteed minimum purchase price.


Sec. 246.201-9  Recommended procedures: Public information and education.</p><p class="depth2">A well organized and well executed public information and education program explaining the justification, goals, methods and level of separation should be conducted to inform and motivate householders and to secure their cooperation in separating their waste. This public information and education program should precede the program and continue on a regular basis for its duration.</p>
