                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the Appeals Council may remand a case. The Appeals Council  may remand a case to an administrative law judge so that he or she may  hold a hearing and issue a decision or a recommended decision. The  Appeals Council may also remand a case in which additional evidence is  needed or additional action by the administrative law judge is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action by administrative law judge on remand. The administrative  law judge shall take any action that is ordered by the Appeals Council  and may take any additional action that is not inconsistent with the  Appeals Council's remand order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice when case is returned with a recommended decision. When  the administrative law judge sends a case to the Appeals Council with a  recommended   decision, a notice is mailed to the parties at their last known address.  The notice tells them that the case has been sent to the Appeals  Council, explains the rules for filing briefs or other written  statements with the Appeals Council, and includes a copy of the  recommended decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing briefs with and obtaining evidence from the Appeals  Council. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may file briefs or other written statements about the  facts and law relevant to your case with the Appeals Council within 20  days of the date that the recommended decision is mailed to you. Any  party may ask the Appeals Council for additional time to file briefs or  statements. The Appeals Council will extend this period, as appropriate,  if you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All other rules for filing briefs with and obtaining evidence  from the Appeals Council follow the procedures explained in this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures before the Appeals Council. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Appeals Council  after receiving a recommended decision will conduct its proceedings and  issue its decision according to the procedures explained in this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Appeals Council believes that more evidence is required,  it may again remand the case to an administrative law judge for further  inquiry into the issues, rehearing, receipt of evidence, and another  decision or recommended decision. However, if the Appeals Council  decides that it can get the additional evidence more quickly, it will  take appropriate action.</p>
