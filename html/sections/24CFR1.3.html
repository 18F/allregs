                            <p class="depth0">This part 1 applies to any program or activity for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including any program or activity assisted under the statutes listed in appendix A of this part 1. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to any such program or activity on or after January 3, 1965. This part 1 does not apply to: (a) Any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended to any such program or activity before January 3, 1965, (c) any assistance to any person who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program or activity, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program or activity, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in Sec. 1.4(c). The fact that certain financial assistance is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such financial assistance is not covered. Other financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the Federal Register.</p>
