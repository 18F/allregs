                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon determining that an employer has failed to pay wages or  provide fringe benefits as required by Sec. 655.731 and Sec. 655.732,  the Administrator shall assess and oversee the payment of back wages or  fringe benefits to any H-1B nonimmigrant who has not been paid or  provided fringe benefits as required. The back wages or fringe benefits  shall be equal to the difference between the amount that should have  been paid and the amount that actually was paid to (or with respect to)  such nonimmigrant(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Civil money penalties. The Administrator may assess civil money  penalties for violations as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A violation pertaining to strike/lockout (Sec. 655.733) or  displacement of U.S. workers (Sec. 655.738);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A substantial violation pertaining to notification (Sec.  655.734), labor condition application specificity (Sec. 655.730), or  recruitment of U.S. workers (Sec. 655.739);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A misrepresentation of material fact on the labor condition  application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An early-termination penalty paid by the employee (Sec.  655.731(c)(10)(i));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Payment by the employee of the additional $500/$1,000 filing fee  (Sec. 655.731(c)(10)(ii)); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Violation of the requirements of the regulations in this  subpart I and subpart H of this part or the provisions regarding public  access (Sec. 655.760) where the violation impedes the ability of the  Administrator to determine whether a violation of sections 212(n) or (t)  of the INA has occurred or the ability of members of the public to have  information needed to file a complaint or information regarding alleged  violations of sections 212(n) or (t) of the INA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A willful failure pertaining to wages/working conditions  (Sec. Sec. 655.731, 655.732), strike/lockout, notification, labor  condition application specificity, displacement (including placement of  an H-1B nonimmigrant at a worksite where the other/secondary employer  displaces a U.S. worker), or recruitment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A willful misrepresentation of a material fact on the labor  condition application; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Discrimination against an employee (Sec. 655.801(a)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amount not to exceed $35,000 per violation where an employer  (whether or not the employer is an H-1B-dependent employer or willful  violator) displaced a U.S. worker employed by the employer in the period  beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the filing of an H-1B  petition in conjunction with any of the following violations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A willful violation of any of the provisions described in Sec.  655.805(a)(2) through (9) pertaining to wages/working condition, strike/ lockout, notification, labor condition application specificity,  displacement, or recruitment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A willful misrepresentation of a material fact on the labor  condition application (Sec. 655.805(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining the amount of the civil money penalty to be  assessed, the Administrator shall consider the type of violation  committed and other relevant factors. The factors which may be  considered include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous history of violation, or violations, by the employer  under the INA and this subpart I or subpart H of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of workers affected by the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gravity of the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Efforts made by the employer in good faith to comply with the  provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1182(n) or (t) and this subparts H and I of this  part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer's explanation of the violation or violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer's commitment to future compliance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the employer achieved a financial gain due  to the violation, or the potential financial loss, potential injury or  adverse effect with respect to other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disqualification from approval of petitions. The Administrator  shall notify the DHS pursuant to Sec. 655.855 that the employer shall  be disqualified from approval of any petitions filed by, or on behalf  of, the employer pursuant to section 204 or section 214(c) of the INA  for the following periods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other administrative remedies. (1) If the Administrator finds a  violation of the provisions specified in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> or (v) of  this section, the Administrator may issue an order requiring the  employer to return to the employee (or pay to the U.S. Treasury if the  employee cannot be located) any money paid by the employee in violation  of those provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, or (b)(3) of  this section, the Administrator may impose such other administrative  remedies as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, including  but not limited to reinstatement of workers who were discriminated  against in violation of Sec. 655.805(a), reinstatement of displaced  U.S. workers, back wages to workers who have been displaced or whose  employment has been terminated in violation of these provisions, or  other appropriate legal or equitable remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The civil money penalties, back wages, and/or any other  remedy(ies) determined by the Administrator to be appropriate are  immediately due for payment or performance upon the assessment by the  Administrator, or upon the decision by an administrative law judge where  a hearing is timely requested, or upon the decision by the Secretary  where review is granted. The employer shall remit the amount of the  civil money penalty by certified check or money order made payable to  the order of ``Wage and Hour Division, Labor.'' The remittance shall be  delivered or mailed to the Wage and Hour Division office in the manner  directed in the Administrator's notice of determination. The payment or  performance of any other remedy prescribed by the Administrator shall  follow procedures established by the Administrator. Distribution of back  wages shall be administered in accordance with existing procedures  established by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as  amended (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that inflationary adjustments to  civil money penalties in accordance with a specified cost-of-living  formula be made, by regulation, at least every four years. The  adjustments are to be based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for  all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average for   All Items. The adjusted amounts will be published in the Federal  Register. The amount of the penalty in a particular case will be based  on the amount of the penalty in effect at the time the violation occurs.
