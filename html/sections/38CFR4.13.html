                            <p class="depth0">The repercussion upon a current rating of service connection when  change is made of a previously assigned diagnosis or etiology must be  kept in mind. The aim should be the reconciliation and continuance of  the diagnosis or etiology upon which service connection for the  disability had been granted. The relevant principle enunciated in Sec.   4.125, entitled ``Diagnosis of mental disorders,'' should have careful  attention in this connection. When any change in evaluation is to be  made, the rating agency should assure itself that there has been an  actual change in the conditions, for better or worse, and not merely a  difference in thoroughness of the examination or in use of descriptive  terms. This will not, of course, preclude the correction of erroneous  ratings, nor will it preclude assignment of a rating in conformity with  Sec.  4.7.  [29 FR 6718, May 22, 1964, as amended at 61 FR 52700, Oct. 8, 1996]</p>
