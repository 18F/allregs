No marine mammals may be taken in the course of fishing unless that vessel has on board a currently valid Authorization Certificate under the MMPA. Regulations governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations are contained in 50 CFR part 229 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility of owners and operators. The owners and operators of each FFV are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the applicable GIFA, this subpart, and any permit issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this subpart. The owners and operators of each FFV bear civil responsibility for the acts of their employees and agents constituting violations, regardless of whether the specific acts were authorized or even forbidden by the employer or principal, and regardless of knowledge concerning the occurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Activity codes. Permits to fish under this subpart may be issued by the Assistant Administrator for the activities described in this paragraph, but the permits may be modified by regulations of this subpart and by the conditions and restrictions attached to the permit (see paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and (l) of this section). The Assistant Administrator may issue a permit, as appropriate, for one or more of the activity codes listed. Only vessels of nations having a GIFA with the United States may be issued permits for activity codes 1 through 9. A GIFA is not required for a vessel to be issued a permit for activity code 10. The activity codes are described as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activity Code 1. Catching, scouting, processing, transshipping, and supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activity Code 2. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and supporting foreign vessels.

Any enforcement action that results from the activities of a launched boat will be taken against the permitted vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duration. A permit is valid from its date of issuance to its date of expiration, unless it is revoked or suspended or the nation issuing the FFV's documents does not accept amendments to the permit made by the Assistant Administrator in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (l) of this section. The permit will be valid for no longer than the calendar year in which it was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable.

Each FFV operator must have a properly completed permit form available on board the FFV when engaged in fishing activities and must produce it at the request of an authorized officer or observer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Suspension and revocation. NMFS may apply sanctions to an FFV's permit by revoking, suspending, or imposing additional permit restrictions on the permit under 15 CFR part 904, if the vessel is involved in the commission of any violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the GIFA, or this subpart; if an agent and a designated representative are not maintained in the United States; if a civil penalty or criminal fine imposed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act has become overdue; or as otherwise specified in the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fees.

(1) The Assistant Administrator may amend a permit by adding ``additional restrictions'' for the conservation and management of fishery resources covered by the permit, or for the national defense or security if the Assistant Administrator determines that such interests would be significantly impaired without such restrictions. Compliance with the added additional restrictions is a condition of the permit. Violations of added additional restrictions will be treated as violations of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Administrator may amend a permit by adding ``additional restrictions'' for the conservation and management of fishery resources covered by the permit, or for the national defense or security if the Assistant Administrator determines that such interests would be significantly impaired without such restrictions.

Violations of added additional restrictions will be treated as violations of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assistant Administrator may make proposed additional restrictions effective immediately, if necessary, to prevent substantial harm to a fishery resource of the United States, to allow for the continuation of ongoing fishing operations, or to allow for fishing to begin at the normal time for opening of the fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Assistant Administrator will send proposed additional restrictions to each Nation whose vessels are affected (via the Secretary of State), to the appropriate Councils, and to the Commandant of the Coast Guard.
