                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An administrative law judge must, within 20 days after the  official termination of the hearing, deliver by mail, or otherwise, to  the district director that administered the claim, the transcript of the  hearing, other documents or pleadings filed with him with respect to the  claim, and his signed compensation order. Upon receipt thereof, the  district director, being the official custodian of all records with  respect to claims he administers, must formally date and file the  transcript, pleadings, and compensation order in his office. Such filing  must be accomplished by the close of business on the next succeeding  working day, and the district director must, on the same day as the  filing was accomplished, serve a copy of the compensation order on the  parties and on the representatives of the parties, if any. Service on  the parties and their representatives must be made by certified mail  unless a party has previously waived service by this method under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All parties and their representatives are entitled to be served  with compensation orders via registered or certified mail. Parties and  their representatives may waive this   right and elect to be served with compensation orders electronically by  filing the appropriate waiver form with the district director  responsible for administering the claim. To waive service by registered  or certified mail, employers, insurance carriers, and their  representatives must file form LS-801 (Waiver of Service by Registered  or Certified Mail for Employers and/or Insurance Carriers), and  claimants and their representatives must file form LS-802 (Waiver of  Service by Registered or Certified Mail for Claimants and/or Authorized  Representatives). A signature on a waiver form represents a knowing and  voluntary waiver of that party's or representative's right to receive  compensation orders via registered or certified mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waiving parties and representatives must provide a valid  electronic address on the waiver form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties and representatives must submit a separate waiver form  for each case in which they intend to waive the right to certified or  registered mail service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A representative may not sign a waiver form on a party's behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All compensation orders issued in a claim after receipt of the  waiver form will be sent to the electronic address provided on the  waiver form. Any changes to the address must be made by submitting  another waiver form. Individuals may revoke their service waiver at any  time by submitting a new waiver form that specifies that the service  waiver is being revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it appears that service in the manner selected by the  individual has not been effective, the district director will serve the  individual by certified mail.</p>
