                            <p class="depth0">Oil and gas wells. In the case of oil and gas wells, gross income  from the property, as used in section 613(c)(1), means the amount for  which the taxpayer sells the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the  well. If the oil or gas is not sold on the premises but is manufactured  or converted into a refined product prior to sale, or is transported  from the premises prior to sale, the gross income from the property  shall be assumed to be equivalent to the representative market or filed  price of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation.
