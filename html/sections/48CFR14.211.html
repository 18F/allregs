                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before solicitation. Information concerning proposed  acquisitions shall not be released outside the Government before  solicitation except for presolicitation notices in accordance with  14.205 or 36.213-2, or long-range acquisition estimates in accordance  with 5.404, or synopses in accordance with 5.201. Within the Government,  such information shall be restricted to those having a legitimate  interest. Releases of information shall be made (1) to all prospective  bidders, and (2) as nearly as possible at the same time, so that one  prospective bidder shall not be given unfair advantage over another. See  3.104 regarding requirements for proprietary and source selection  information including access to and disclosure thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After solicitation. Discussions with prospective bidders  regarding a solicitation shall be conducted and technical or other  information shall be transmitted only by the contracting officer or  superiors having contractual authority or by others specifically  authorized. Such personnel shall not furnish any information to a  prospective bidder that alone or together with other information may  afford an advantage over others. However, general information that would  not be prejudicial to other prospective bidders may be furnished upon  request; e.g., explanation of a particular contract clause or a  particular condition of the schedule in the invitation for bids, and  more specific information or clarifications may be furnished by amending  the solicitation (see 14.208).
