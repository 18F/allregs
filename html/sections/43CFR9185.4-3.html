                            <p class="depth0">The owners of three-fourths of the privately owned lands within the  township are required to join in the application, and all petitioners in  whom ownership is vested, either individuals, the State, or corporations  such as railroad companies whose interests are involved, are further  required to supply, following their respective signatures, an accurate  description by legal subdivision, section, township, and range of the  lands to which title is claimed. Moreover, it must appear that notice of  the proposed resurvey has been served upon all owners who have for any  reason failed to join in the petition, and, in addition, it is highly  desirable that all record entrymen who, under the terms of the act are  not required to become parties to the petition, be similarly informed to  the end that their objections, if any, may be heard and subsequent  protest based upon the plea of ignorance may, insofar as possible, be  avoided.
