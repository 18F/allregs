(Ref. Sec. 1512.16(g)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conditioning. The following conditioning in the order given shall be performed prior to testing for performance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Warpage conditioning. The reflector shall be held in a preheated oven for at least one hour at 50[deg] 5 [deg]C (1225.4 [deg]F). A pedal reflector may be conditioned integrally with its pedal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mechanical impact conditioning. The reflector shall be mounted faceup in a manner similar to the way in which it is mounted on the bicycle. A 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) diameter polished steel ball shall be dropped normal to the center of the face of the reflector from a height of 0.76 m (30 in.). The ball may be guided by a tube with holes, but not restricted in free fall. Pedal reflectors are exempt from this impact conditioning.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Moisture conditioning. The reflector shall be submerged in tap water in a suitable container. The container shall be pressurized in 17.2 kN/m\2\ (2.5 psi) (equivalent to 1.7 m (5\3/4\ ft.)) of water for 15 minutes and then released.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reflector performance test. (i) Arrangements for the reflector performance test shall be as shown in figure 3 and the distance D between the light source and the reflector shall be 30.5 m (100 ft.). The source of illumination shall be a lamp with a 51 mm (2.0 in.) effective diameter and a filament operating at 2,85610 percent color temperature. The observation point shall be colocated (as close as practicable) with the source of illumination. The reflector shall be mounted with the center of the reflector at the center of rotation and at the same horizontal level as the source of illumination. Photometric measurements shall be made at the observation angles and entrance angles given in tables 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arrangements for the reflector performance test shall be as shown in figure 3 and the distance D between the light source and the reflector shall be 30.5 m (100 ft.). The source of illumination shall be a lamp with a 51 mm (2.0 in.) effective diameter and a filament operating at 2,85610 percent color temperature. The observation point shall be colocated (as close as practicable) with the source of illumination. The reflector shall be mounted with the center of the reflector at the center of rotation and at the same horizontal level as the source of illumination. Photometric measurements shall be made at the observation angles and entrance angles given in tables 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The observation angle is the angle formed by a line from the point of observation to the center of the reflector with a second line from the center of the reflector to the source of illumination. The entrance angle is the angle between the optical axis of the reflector and a line from the center of

the reflector to the source of illumination. The entrance angle shall be designated left, right, up, and down in accordance with the position of the source of illumination with respect to the axis of the reflector as viewed from behind the reflector when the plane of the observation angle is vertical and the receiver is above the source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Photometric measurements shall be made either visually or photoelectrically. With either method, the light reflected to the observation point shall be determined. Also, the illumination on the reflector from the source shall be measured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For visual measurements a comparison lamp, emitting light similar in spectral quality to the reflector, shall be located adjacent to the reflector (at an angle not to exceed \1/2\[deg]) and arranged so that the candlepower can be varied from 0.01 to 0.25 to make the intensity duplicate that of the reflector under test. The candlepower of the source of the illumination of the reflector under test shall be known or determined for this test. Means shall be provided to change the intensity of the source of illumination without changing the filament color temperature. The comparison lamp shall be designed to avoid reflection from the source of illumination back in the direction of the observer. It shall be of such size and so diffused that when viewed by the observer (through a 2\1/2\x reducing monocular), the candlepower can be readily compared and adjusted to that of the reflector. The observer shall have at least 10 minutes of dark adaption before making observations. For photoelectric measurements, the opening to the photocell shall not be more than \1/2\ inch vertical by 1 inch horizontal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reflectors that mount on the bicycle in a fixed rotational position with respect to the bicycle, or the bicycle component on which they are mounted (such as pedals or spokes), shall be tested with a single orientation. Reflectors that do not mount on the bicycle in a fixed rotational position with respect to the bicycle shall be rotated about their axis through 360[deg] to find the minimum candlepower per footcandle for each test point. If the measurement falls below the minimum requirement at any test point, the reflector shall be rotated 5[deg] about its axis from the angle where the minimum occurs, and the maximum candlepower per footcandle within this angle shall be the measured value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Should uncolored reflections from the front surface interfere with photometric readings at any test point the lowest reading and location within 1[deg] above, below, right, and left of the test point shall meet the minimum requirement for the test point.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A recommended coordinate system for definition of color is the ``Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE 1931)'' system. In the coordinate system and when illuminated by the source defined in table 4 of this part 1512, a reflector will be considered to be red if its color falls within the region bounded by the red spectrum locus and the lines y = 0.980-x and y = 0.335; a reflector will be considered to be amber if its color falls within the region bounded by the yellow spectrum locus and the lines y = 0.382, y = 0.790-0.667x, and y = x-0.120.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Reflective tire and rim test (Ref. Sec. 1512.16(h) and (i)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apparatus. Arrangements for the reflective intensity measurement shall be as shown in figure 3 of this part 1512. A light projector (having a maximum effective lens diameter of D/500, where D is the distance from the source to the retroreflective surface being measured) capable of projecting light of uniform intensity shall be used to illuminate the sample. The light falling on the sample shall have a color temperature of 2856[deg]K+10% (equivalent to a tungsten filament lamp operated at a color temperature of 2856[deg]K+10% having approximately the relative energy distribution given in table 4 of this part 1512). The light reflected from the test surface shall be measured with a photoelectric receiver, the response of which has been corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the average photopic human eye. The dimensions of the active area of the receiver shall be such that no point on the perimeter of the receiver is more than D/100 from its center (where d is the distance from the receiver to the retroreflective surface). Wheels used for the measurement of retroreflective tires or rims shall

have all exposed metallic surfaces, including spokes, masked in flat black so that when measured these surfaces indicate no appreciable reflectance. The tire shall be mounted and fully inflated. Distances shall be measured from the plane of the wheel and the center of the hub. For the tests, the distance D between the projector and the center of the wheel and distance d between the center of the wheel and the receiver shall each be at least 15 m (50 ft.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure--(i) Masking. The reflecting strip to be tested shall be within two concentric circles, the larger of which is no more than 0.02 m (0.79 in.) greater in radius than the smaller. While additional reflecting material is permitted outside such boundaries, such additional material shall not be counted in determining the average width of the reflecting strip and shall be masked off with opaque, matte black tape in testing the reflecting material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Masking. The reflecting strip to be tested shall be within two concentric circles, the larger of which is no more than 0.02 m (0.79 in.) greater in radius than the smaller. While additional reflecting material is permitted outside such boundaries, such additional material shall not be counted in determining the average width of the reflecting strip and shall be masked off with opaque, matte black tape in testing the reflecting material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Orientation. Every position of the reflecting strip on the rim or the mounted and fully inflated tire to be tested shall be oriented so that the normal to this portion is within 40[deg] of parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Measurement. Measure the distance d from the receiver to the center of the wheel and the minimum distance r from the axis of rotation of the wheel to the unmasked portion of the reflective strip. Measure the illumination incident on the reflective strip at uniform intervals of no more than 45[deg] around the wheel, with the receiver oriented in the direction of the incident radiation. The average of such readings will be the mean illumination of the sample E. If any one of such readings differs by more than 10 percent from the mean illumination, then a more uniform source must be obtained. Measure the illumination of the receiver due to reflection from the retroreflective surface for each entrance angle and each observation angle given in table 3 of this part 1512. The entrance angle and the observation angle shall be in the same plane. A negative entrance angle (figure 3 of this part 1512) is specified when the entrance angle is small because the location of the receiver with respect to the direction of illumination becomes important for distinguishing between ordinary mirror-like reflection and retroreflection. The illumination incident on the test surface and the receiver shall be measured in the same units on a linear scale. Compute the ratio A for each combination of entrance angle and observation angle listed in table 3 as follows:
A = [(Er / Es)(d\2\ / r)]
Where:
A = Ratio in meters,Er = Illumination incident upon the receiver,Es = Illumination incident upon a plane perpendicular to the incident ray at the specimen position (see instructions above in this paragraph (o)(2)(iii) for averaging), measured in the same units as Er,d = The distance in meters from the receiver to the center of the wheel,r = The minimum radius in meters of the boundary circles of the retroreflective strip.

The minimum value of A shall be that listed in table 3 of this part 1512 for each combination of entrance angle and observation angle. The plane containing the entrance angle and the plane containing the observation angle shall coincide. In table 3, a positive entrance angle corresponds to the case in which the line of sight to the receiver lies between the line of incidence and the optic axis of the reflector, and a negative entrance angle corresponds to the case in which the line of incidence lies between the line of sight of the receiver and optic axis of the reflector.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Criteria. The ratio A as defined in Sec. 1512.18(o)(2)(iii) shall not be less than:
A = 4Cos\2\[thetas]/[1+([Phi]/0.225)\3/2\]

where A is ratio in meters, [thetas] is the entrance angle in degrees, and [Phi] is the observation angle in degrees. The criterion applies only for entrance angles from 0[deg] to 40[deg] and observation angles from 0.2[deg] to 1.5[deg], and performance is not specified beyond this range. The values of A in table 3 are obtained from the above formula by rounding up to two significant figures. Except in cases in which the performance of the reflector is seriously questionable, a reflector with A at least the value given in table

3 at each of the six combinations of entrance and observation angles will be considered to satisfy this criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Road test. (Ref. Sec. Sec. 1512.15(c) and 1512.17(a)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. The bicycle shall be ridden at least 6.4 km (4.0 mi.) by a rider weighing at least 68.1 kg (150 lb.) with the tires inflated to maximum recommended pressure. Travel shall include riding the bicycle five times over a 30 m (100 ft.) course of wooden cleats fastened to a paved surface. The cleats shall be a full 25 mm (1.0 in.) high by 51 mm (2.0 in.) wide lumber with a 12 mm by 12 mm (\1/2\ in. by \1/2\ in.) chamfer of 45[deg] on the corners contacting the tires. The cleats shall be spaced every 1.8 m (6.0 ft.) over the 30 m (100 ft.) course. The bicycle shall be ridden over the cleated course at a speed of at least 24 km/hr (15 mph) with the rider firmly seated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Criteria. The bicycle shall exhibit stable handling, turning, and steering characteristics without difficulty of operation. There shall be no system or component failure of the structure, brakes, or tires and there shall be no loosening or misalignment of the seat, handlebars, controls, or reflectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Sidewalk bicycle proof test. (Ref. Sec. Sec. 1512.15(c) and 1512.17(b)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. The bicycle shall be loaded with weights of 13.6 kg (30 lb.) on the seat surface and 4.5 kg (10 lb.) attached to the end of each handle grip for a total load of 22.7 kg (50 lb.). The bicycle shall be lifted a distance of 0.3 m (1.0 ft.) and dropped (while maintaining an upright position) three times onto a paved surface. Following this and with weight removed, it shall be allowed to fall in any configuration and attitude from an upright position to the paved surface three times on each side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Abrasion test for retroreflective rims. (Ref. Sec. 1512.16(i)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This test consists of a steel wire cup brush rotating at a constant velocity of 60 rpm that is applied at a force of 2 N (0.45 lbf) to the retroreflective material on one side of a bicycle wheel rim. The rim is rotated about the axle at a linear velocity of 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec). The test is complete when the wheel has completed 1000 revolutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apparatus. Figure 8 of this part 1512 illustrates the following test fixture arrangement that is suitable to perform this abrasion test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test fixture. The test fixture contains a clamp to hold the axle of a bicycle wheel so that the wheel can rotate freely about the axle. The axis of rotation is capable of being inclined from the vertical to bring that portion of the side of the wheel rim containing the retroreflective material into a horizontal plane as it passes beneath the abrading brush. A drive mechanism to rotate the bicycle wheel contains a means to adjust the rotational velocity to obtain the specified linear velocity measured at a point on the wheel rim on the axis of the abrading brush.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Abrader. The abrader is a cup brush meeting the specification in paragraph (r)(3)(v) of this section. It is mounted in a chuck attached to a motor that rotates about a vertical axis at the specified rotational velocity. A means is provided to apply the rotating cup brush at the specified force against the retroreflective material on the bicycle wheel rim. The axis of the abrading brush is positioned on the mid point in the width of the retroreflective material. The force is produced by deadweights applied to a pan on the axis of the counterbalanced motor/brush assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifications. (i) The linear velocity of the reflective band on wheel rim shall be 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec) measured at a point on the axis of the abrading brush.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The linear velocity of the reflective band on wheel rim shall be 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec) measured at a point on the axis of the abrading brush.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rotational velocity of the abrading brush shall be 60 rpm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The force normal to the plane of the retroreflective material at which the abrading brush is to be applied shall be 2 N (0.45 lbf).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The bicycle wheel shall make 1000 complete revolutions per test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The abrader shall be a cup brush having bristles that are 0.005 in. (approx. 0.13mm) diameter low carbon steel wire; an outside diameter of 0.5 inch (aprox. .13mm); a wire bristle length of 0.25 inch (approx. 6.4mm); and

a cup diameter of 0.405 inch (approx. 10.29mm). \6\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\6\ For compliance testing the Commission will use a brush meeting this description distributed by Dremel Manufacturing Company, Racine, Wisconsin as Dremel Part No. 442.
