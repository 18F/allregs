                            <p class="depth0">The Inmate Accident Compensation system is not obligated to comply  with the provisions of any other system of worker's compensation except  where stated in this part. Awards made under the provisions of the  Inmate Accident Compensation procedure differ from awards made under  civilian workmen's compensation laws in that hospitalization is usually  completed prior to the inmate's release from the institution and, except  for a three-day waiting period, the inmate receives wages while absent  from work. Other factors necessarily must be considered that do not  enter into the administration of civilian workmen's compensation laws.  As in the case of federal employees who allege they have sustained work- related injuries, the burden of proof lies with the claimant to  establish that the claimed impairment is causally related to the  claimant's work assignment.</p>
