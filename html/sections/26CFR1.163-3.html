                                Sec. 1.163-3  Deduction for discount on bond issued on or before
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discount upon issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If bonds are issued by a corporation  at a discount, the net amount of such discount is deductible and should  be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds. For purposes of  this section, the amortizable bond discount equals the excess of the  amount payable at maturity (or, in the case of a callable bond, at the  earlier call date) over the issue price of the bond (as defined in  paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1232-3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Discount with respect to bonds issued by a corporation as part  of investment units consisting of obligations and options after December  31, 1954, and before Dec. 24, 1968--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Increased by any amount treated as bond premium which has been  included in gross income with respect to such bonds prior to Dec. 24,  1968, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Decreased by any amount which has been deducted by the issuer  as discount attributable to such bonds prior to Dec. 24, 1968, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Decreased by any amount which has been deducted by the issuer  prior to Dec. 24, 1968 upon the exercise or sale by investors of options  issued in investment units with such bonds,  should be amortized, starting with the first taxable year ending on or  after Dec. 24, 1968 over the remaining life of such bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The rules in paragraph (a) of this section are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. M Corporation, on January 1, 1960, the beginning of its  taxable year issued for $95,000, 3 percent bonds, maturing 10 years from  the date of issue, with a stated redemption price at maturity of  $100,000. M Corporation should treat $5,000 ($100,000-$95,000) as the  total amount to be amortized over the life of the bonds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as example (1), except that the  bonds are convertible into common stock of M Corporation. Since the  issue price of the bonds includes any amount attributable to the  conversion privilege, the result is the same as in example (1).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as example (1), except that the  bonds are issued as part of an investment unit consisting of an  obligation and an option. Assume further that the issue price of the  bonds as determined under the rules of allocation set forth in  subdivision (ii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3(b)(2) is $94,000. Accordingly, M  Corporation should treat $6,000 ($100,000-$94,000) as the total amount  to be amortized over the life of the bonds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume in example (3), that prior to Dec. 24, 1968, M  Corporation had only treated $5,000 as the bond discount to be amortized  and deducted only $4,000 of this amount. Starting with the first taxable  year ending on or after Dec. 24, 1968, M Corporation should amortize  $2,000 ($6,000 discount, less $4,000 previously deducted) over the  remaining life of the bonds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. N Corporation, on January 1, 1956, for a consideration of  $102,000, issued 20-year bonds in the face amount of $100,000, together  with options to purchase stock of N Corporation. The issue price of the  bonds as determined under the rules of allocation set forth in  subdivision (ii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3(b)(2) is $99,000. Until Dec. 24,  1968, N Corporation has treated as bond premium, $2,000, representing  the excess of the consideration received for the bond-option investment  units over the maturity value of the bonds, and has accordingly prorated  and included in income $1,200 of such amount. Starting with the first  taxable year beginning on or after Dec. 24, 1968, N Corporation may  amortize as a deduction over the remaining life of the bonds the amount  of $2,200 ($1,000 discount, plus $1,200 previously included in income).</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. O Corporation, on January 1, 1956, for a consideration of  $100,000, issued 20-year bonds with a $100,000 face value, together with  options to purchase stock of O Corporation, which could be exercised at  any time up to 5 years from the date of issue. The issue price of the  bonds as determined under the rules of allocation set forth in  subdivision (ii)(a) of Sec. 1.1232-3(b)(2) is $98,000. O Corporation,  upon the exercise of the options prior to Dec. 24, 1968, had deducted  from income their fair market value at the time of exercise, which is  assumed for purposes of this example to have been $3,000. Even though  the bonds are considered to have been issued at a discount under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, O Corporation would have no deduction  over the remaining life of the bonds, inasmuch as O Corporation, in  computing the amount of such deduction, is required under paragraph  (a)(2)(iii) of this section to reduce the amount which would otherwise  be treated as bond discount, $2,000 ($100,000-$98,000), by the amount  deducted from income upon the exercise of the options, in this case,  $3,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deduction upon repurchase. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if bonds are issued by a  corporation and are subsequently repurchased by the corporation at a  price in excess of the issue price plus any amount of discount deducted  prior to repurchase, or (in the case of bonds issued subsequent to Feb.  28, 1913) minus any amount of premium returned as income prior to  repurchase, the excess of the purchase price over the issue price  adjusted for amortized premium or discount is a deductible expense for  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a convertible bond (except a bond which the  corporation, before Sept. 5, 1968, has obligated itself to repurchase at  a specified price), the deduction allowable under subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph may not exceed an amount equal to 1 year's interest at  the rate specified in the bond, except to the extent that the  corporation can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or  his delegate that an amount in excess of 1 year's interest does not  include any amount attributable to the conversion feature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No deduction shall be allowed under subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph to the extent a deduction is disallowed under subparagraph (2)  of this   paragraph or to the extent a deduction is disallowed by section 249  (relating to limitation on deduction of bond premium on repurchase of  convertible obligation) and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph  (f) of Sec. 1.249-1 for effective date limitation on section 249.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, a debenture, note,  certificate other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a corporation and  bearing interest shall be given the same treatment as a bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section shall not apply  in respect of a bond issued after May 27, 1969, unless issued pursuant  to a written commitment which was binding on that date and at all times  thereafter.  [T.D. 6984, 33 FR 19175, Dec. 24, 1968, as amended by T.D. 7154, 36 FR  24996, Dec. 28, 1971; T.D. 7259, 38 FR 4253, Feb. 12, 1973]</p>
