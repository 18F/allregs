                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard State indicators. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a State ``on'' indicator  in a State for a week if the head of the State agency determines, in  accordance with this section, that, for the period consisting of that  week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, the rate of insured  unemployment (not seasonally adjusted) under the State law--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Equalled or exceeded 120 percent of the average of such rates  for the corresponding 13-week periods ending in each of the preceding  two calendar years, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equalled or exceeded 5.0 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a State ``off'' indicator in a State for a week if the  head of the State agency determines, in accordance with this section,  that, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately  preceding 12 weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not seasonally  adjusted) under the State law--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Was less than 120 percent of the average of such rates for the  corresponding 13 week periods ending in each of the preceding two  calendar years, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Was less than 5.0 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The standard State indicators in this paragraph (a) shall apply  to weeks beginning after September 25, 1982.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional State indicators. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A State may, in addition to  the State indicators in paragraph (a) of this section, provide by its  law that there shall be a State ``on'' indicator in the State for a week  if the head of the State agency determines, in accordance with this  section, that, for the period consisting of that week and the  immediately preceding 12 weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not  seasonally adjusted) under the State law equalled or exceeded 6.0  percent even though it did not meet the 120 percent factor required  under paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State which adopts the optional State indicator must also  provide that, when it is in an Extended Benefit Period, there will not  be an ``off'' indicator until (A) the State rate of insured unemployment  is less than 6.0 percent, and (B) either its rate of insured  unemployment is less than 5.0 percent or is less than 120 percent of   the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week periods ending  in each of the preceding two calendar years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The optional State indicators in this paragraph (b) shall apply  to weeks beginning after September 25, 1982.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of rate of insured unemployment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equation. Each  week the State agency head shall calculate the rate of insured  unemployment under the State law (not seasonally adjusted) for purposes  of determining the State ``on'' and ``off'' and ``no change''  indicators. In making such calculations the State agency head shall use  a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the weekly average number of  weeks claimed in claims filed (not seasonally adjusted) in the State in  the 13-week period ending with the week for which the determination is  made, and the denominator of which shall be the average monthly  employment covered by the State law for the first four of the last six  calendar quarters ending before the close of the 13-week period. The  quotient obtained is to be computed to four decimal places, and is not  otherwise rounded, and is to be expressed as a percentage by multiplying  the resultant decimal fraction by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counting weeks claimed. To determine the average number of weeks  claimed in claims filed to serve as the numerator under paragraph  (c)(1), the State agency shall include claims for all weeks for regular  compensation, including claims taken as agent State under the Interstate  Benefit Payment Plan. It shall exclude claims--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For Extended Benefits under any State law,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For additional compensation under any State law, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under any Federal law except joint claims which combine  regular compensation and compensation payable under 5 U.S.C. chapter 85.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Method of computing the State 120 percent factor. The rate of  insured unemployment for a current 13-week period shall be divided by  the average of the rates of insured unemployment for the corresponding  13-week periods in each of the two preceding calendar years to determine  whether the rate is equal to 120 percent of the average rate for the two  years. The quotient obtained shall be computed to four decimal places  and not otherwise rounded, and shall be expressed as a percentage by  multiplying the resultant decimal fraction by 100. The average of the  rates for the corresponding 13-week periods in each of the two preceding  calendar years shall be one-half the sum of such rates computed to four  decimal places and not otherwise rounded. To determine which are the  corresponding weeks in the preceding years--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The weeks shall be numbered starting with week number 1 as the  first week ending in each calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The 13-week period ending with any numbered week in the current  year shall correspond to the period ending with that same numbered week  in each preceding year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When that period in the current year ends with week number 53,  the corresponding period in preceding years shall end with week number  52 if there is no week number 53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. Any change hereunder shall be subject to the concurrence of the  Department as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any determination of the rate of insured unemployment and its  effect   on an ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator may be challenged by  appeal or by other proceedings, as shall be provided by State law, but  the implementation of any change in the indicator from one week to  another shall not be stayed or postponed. In a hearing on any such  challenge the issue may be limited to the accuracy of the determination  of the rate of insured unemployment. If an error in that rate affecting  the ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator is discovered in such a  hearing or other proceeding, its retroactive effect shall be limited as  provided in paragraph (d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to Secretary. Within 10 calendar days after the end of  any week with respect to which the head of a State agency has determined  that there is an ``on,'' or ``off,'' or ``no change'' indicator in the  State, the head of the State agency shall notify the Department of the  determination. The notice shall state clearly the State agency head's  determination of the specific week for which there is a State ``on'' or  ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator. The notice shall include also the  State agency head's findings supporting the determination, with a  certification that the findings are made in accordance with the  requirements of this Sec. 615.15. Determinations and findings made as  provided in this section shall be accepted by the Department, but the  head of the State agency shall comply with such provisions as the  Department may find necessary to assure the correctness and verification  of notices given under this paragraph. A notice shall not become final  for purposes of the Act and this part until such notice is accepted by  the Department.</p>
