                            <p class="depth0">With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator  approves Washington's plan for the attainment and maintenance of  National Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. The  regulations included in the SIP (See Table 52.2479) are applicable  statewide unless otherwise noted in the regulation itself. Furthermore,  the Administrator finds that the plan as identified in Sec. 52.2470  satisfies requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air act as  amended in 1977, except as noted in the following sections. Continued  satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the  SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July  1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and  January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of  additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the  previous January. New source review permits pursuant to section 173 of  CAA will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V  of the emission offset interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979  (44 FR 3274) are met.  [45 FR 37836, June 5, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 45609, Sept. 14, 1981;  47 FR 7840, Feb. 23, 1982]</p>
