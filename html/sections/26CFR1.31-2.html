                                Sec.  1.31-2  Credit for ``special refunds'' of employee social security
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,  as amended by sections 208(b) and 204(a), respectively, of the Social  Security Amendments of 1954 (68 Stat. 1094, 1091).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee who is entitled to a special refund of employee tax  with respect to wages received during a calendar year and who is also  required to file an income tax return for such calendar year (or for his  last taxable year beginning in such calendar year) may obtain the  benefits of such special refund only by claiming credit for such special  refund in the same manner as if such special refund were an amount  deducted and withheld as income tax at the source. For provisions for  claiming special refunds for 1955 and subsequent years in the case of  employees not required to file income tax returns, see section 6413(c)  and the regulations thereunder. For provisions relating to such refunds  for 1954, see 26 CFR (1939) 408.802 (regulations 128).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the special refund allowed as a credit shall be  considered as an amount deducted and withheld as income tax at the  source under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or, in the  case of a special refund for   1954, subchapter D, chapter 9 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). If  the amount of such special refund when added to amounts deducted and  withheld as income tax exceeds the taxes imposed by subtitle A of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the amount of the excess constitutes an  overpayment of income tax under Subtitle A, and interest on such  overpayment is allowed to the extent provided under section 6611 upon an  overpayment of income tax resulting from a credit for income tax  withheld at source. See section 6401(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal and State employees and employees of certain foreign  corporations. The provisions of this section shall apply to the amount  of a special refund allowable to an employee of a Federal agency or a  wholly owned instrumentality of the United States, to the amount of a  special refund allowable to an employee of any State or political  subdivision thereof (or any instrumentality of any one or more of the  foregoing), and to the amount of a special refund allowable to employees  of certain foreign corporations. See, with respect to such special  refunds for 1954, section 1401(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of  1939, and with respect to such special refunds for 1955 and subsequent  years, section 6413(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as  amended by section 202 of the Social Security amendments of 1954.</p>
