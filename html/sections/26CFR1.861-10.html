For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following  terms shall have the following meanings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S. shareholder. The term ``U.S. shareholder'' has the same  meaning as the term ``United States shareholder'' when used in section  957, except that, in the case of a United States shareholder that is a  member of an affiliated group (as defined in Sec. 1.861-11T(d)), the  entire affiliated group is considered to constitute a single U.S.  shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Related person. For the definition of the term ``related  person'', see Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2). A controlled foreign corporation is  considered ``related'' to a U.S. shareholder if it is a related person  with respect to the U.S. shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Determination of asset values. A U.S. shareholder shall  determine the values of the assets of each related controlled foreign  corporation (for purposes of Step One in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section) and the assets of the U.S. shareholder (for purposes of Step  Two in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) for   any year in accordance with the valuation method (tax book value or fair  market value) elected for that year pursuant to Sec. 1.861-9T(g).  However, solely for purposes of this paragraph (e), a U.S. shareholder  may instead choose to determine the values of the assets of all related  controlled foreign corporations by reference to their values as  reflected on Forms 5471 (the annual information return with respect to  each related controlled foreign corporation), subject to the translation  rules of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section. This method of valuation  may be used only if the taxable years of each of the related controlled  foreign corporations begin with, or no more than one month earlier than,  the taxable year of the U.S. shareholder. Once chosen for a taxable  year, this method of valuation must be used in each subsequent taxable  year and may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Adjustments to asset value. For purposes of apportioning  remaining interest expense under Sec. 1.861-9T, a U.S. shareholder  shall reduce (but not below zero) the value of its assets for the year  (as determined under Sec. 1.861-9T (g) (3) or (h)) by an amount equal  to the allocable related group indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for  the year (as determined under Step Three in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this  section). This reduction is allocated among assets in each separate  limitation category in proportion to the average amount of related group  indebtedness held by the U.S. shareholder in each separate limitation  category during the year (as determined under Step Three in paragraph  (e)(4)(v) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exchange rates. All indebtedness amounts and  asset values (including current year and base year amounts and values)  denominated in a foreign currency shall be translated into U.S. dollars  at the exchange rate for the current year. The exchange rate for the  current year may be determined under any reasonable method (e.g.,  average of month-end exchange rates for each month in the current year)  if it is consistently applied to the current year and all base years.  Once chosen for a taxable year, a method for determining an exchange  rate must be used in each subsequent taxable year and will be treated as  a method of accounting for purposes of section 446. A taxpayer may apply  a different translation rule only with the prior consent of the  Commissioner. In this regard, the Commissioner will be guided by the  extent to which a different rule would reduce the comparability of  dollar amounts of indebtedness and dollar asset values for the base  years and the current year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exempt assets. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (e), any  exempt assets otherwise excluded under section 864(e)(3) and Sec.  1.861-8T(d) shall be included as assets of the U.S. shareholder or  related controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusion of certain directly allocated indebtedness and  assets. Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (as defined in Sec. 1.861- 10T(b)(2)) and indebtedness incurred in connection with an integrated  financial transaction (as defined in Sec. 1.861-10T(c)(2)) shall be  excluded from U.S. shareholder indebtedness and related group  indebtedness. In addition, assets which are the subject of qualified  nonrecourse indebtedness or integrated financial transactions shall be  excluded from the assets of the U.S. shareholder and each related  controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exclusion of certain receivables. Receivables between related  controlled foreign corporations (or between members of the affiliated  group constituting the U.S. shareholder) shall be excluded from the  assets of the related controlled foreign corporation (or affiliated  group member) holding such receivables. See also Sec. 1.861-11T(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Classification of certain loans as related group indebtedness.  If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A U.S. shareholder owns stock in a related controlled foreign  corporation which is a resident of a country that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Does not impose a withholding tax of 5 percent or more upon  payments of dividends to a U.S. shareholder; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Does not, for the taxable year of the controlled foreign  corporation, subject the income of the controlled foreign corporation to  an income tax which is greater than that percentage specified under  Sec. 1.954-1T(d)(1)(i) of the maximum rate of tax specified under  section 11 of the Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section and, thus, such loan amounts shall be  considered related group indebtedness. However, for purposes of  paragraph (e)(4) of this section, interest income derived by the U.S.  shareholder during the year from related group indebtedness shall not  include any income derived with respect to the U.S. shareholder's  ownership of stock in the related controlled foreign corporation that  made such loans or additional contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Classification of certain stock as related person indebtedness.  In determining the amount of its related group indebtedness for any  taxable year, a U.S. shareholder must treat as related group  indebtedness its holding of stock in a related controlled foreign  corporation if, during such taxable year, such related controlled  foreign corporation claims a deduction for interest under foreign law  for distributions on such stock. However, for purposes of paragraph  (e)(4) of this section, interest income derived by the U.S. shareholder  during the year from related group indebtedness shall not include any  income derived with respect to the U.S. shareholder's ownership of stock  in the related controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Corporate events--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial acquisition of a controlled  foreign corporation. If the foreign base period of the U.S. shareholder  for any year includes a base year in which the U.S. shareholder did not  hold stock in any related controlled foreign corporation, then, in  computing the foreign base period ratio, the related group debt-to-asset  ratio of the U.S. shareholder for any such base year shall be deemed to  be 0.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incorporation of U.S. shareholder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nonapplication. This  paragraph (e) does not apply to the first taxable year of the U.S.  shareholder. However, this paragraph (e) does apply to all following  years, including years in which later members of the affiliated group  may be incorporated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreign and U.S. base period ratios. In computing the foreign  and U.S. base period ratios, the foreign and U.S. base periods of the  U.S. shareholder shall be considered to be only the period prior to the  current year that the U.S. shareholder was in existence if this prior  period is less than five taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Acquisition of additional corporations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a U.S.  shareholder acquires (directly or indirectly) stock of a foreign or  domestic corporation which, by reason of the acquisition, then becomes a  related controlled foreign corporation or a member of the affiliated  group, then in determining excess related group indebtedness or excess  U.S. shareholder indebtedness, the indebtedness and assets of the  acquired corporation shall be taken into account only at the end of the  acquisition year and in following years. Thus, amounts of indebtedness  and assets and the various debt-to-asset ratios of the U.S. shareholder  existing at the beginning of the acquisition year or relating to  preceding years are not recalculated to take account of indebtedness and  assets of the acquired corporation existing as of dates before the end  of the year. If, however, a major acquisition is made within the last  three months of the year and a substantial distortion of values for the  year would otherwise result, the taxpaper must take into account the  average values of the acquired indebtedness and assets weighted to  reflect the time such indebtedness is owed and such assets are held by  the taxpayer during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a reverse acquisition subject to this paragraph  (e)(9), the rules of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3) apply in determining which  corporations are the acquiring and acquired corporations. For this  purpose, whether corporations are affiliated is determined under Sec.  1.861-11T(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> applies is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A corporation which is not affiliated with any other corporation  (other than other similarly described corporation); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantially all of the assets of which consist of cash,  securities and stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election to compute base period ratios by including acquired  corporations. A U.S. shareholder may choose, solely for purposes of  paragraph (e)(9) (i) and (iii) of this section, to compute its foreign  and U.S. base period ratios for the acquisition year and all subsequent  years by taking into account the indebtedness and asset values of the  acquired corporation or corporations (including related group  indebtedness owed to a former U.S. shareholder) at the beginning of the  acquisition year and in each of the five base years preceding the  acquisition year. This election, if made for an acquisition, must be  made for all other acquisitions occurring during the same taxable year  or initiated in that year and concluded in the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Dispositions. If a U.S. shareholder disposes of stock of a  foreign or domestic corporation which, by reason of the disposition,  then ceases to be a related controlled foreign corporation or a member  of the affiliated group (unless liquidated or merged into a related  corporation), in determining excess related group indebtedness or excess  U.S. shareholder indebtedness, the indebtedness and assets of the  divested corporation shall be taken into account only at the beginning  of the disposition year and for the relevant preceding years. Thus,  amounts of indebtedness and assets and the various debt-to-asset ratios  of the U.S. shareholder existing at the end of the year or relating to  following years are not affected by indebtedness and assets of the  divested corporation existing as of dates after the beginning of the  year. If, however, a major disposition is made within the first three  months of the year and a substantial distortion of values for the year  would otherwise result, the taxpayer must take into account the average  values of the divested indebtedness and assets weighted to reflect the  time such indebtedness is owed and such assets are held by the taxpayer  during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Election to compute base period ratios by excluding divested  corporations. A U.S. shareholder may choose, solely for purposes of  paragraph (e) (9) (v) and (vii) of this section, to compute its foreign  and U.S. base period ratios for the disposition year and all subsequent  years without taking into account the indebtedness and asset values of  the divested corporation or corporations at the beginning of the  disposition year and in each of the five base years preceding the  disposition year.

Paragraph (c) of this section  describes the direct allocation of interest expense to income generated  by certain assets that are acquired in integrated financial transaction.  Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules that are applicable  to all transactions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.  Paragraph (e) of this section requires the direct allocation of third  party interest of an affiliated group to such group's investment in  related controlled foreign corporations in cases involving excess  related person indebtedness (as defined therein).

In the case  of qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section), the deduction for interest shall be considered directly  allocable solely to the gross income which the property acquired,  constructed, or improved with the proceeds of the indebtedness  generates, has generated, or could reasonably be expected to generate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness defined. The term ``qualified  nonrecourse indebtedness'' means any borrowing that is not excluded by  paragraph (b)(4) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The borrowing is specifically incurred for the purpose of  purchasing, constructing, or improving identified property that is  either depreciable tangible personal property or real property with a  useful life of more than one year or for the purpose of purchasing  amortizable intangible personal property with a useful life of more than  one year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proceeds are actually applied to purchase, construct, or  improve the identified property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) (relating to  certain third party guarantees in leveraged lease transactions), the  creditor can look only to the identified property (or any lease or other  interest therein) as security for payment of the principal and interest  on the loan and, thus, cannot look to any other property, the borrower,  or any third party with respect to repayment of principal or interest on  the loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The cash flow from the property, as defined in paragraph (b)(3)  of this section, is reasonably expected to be sufficient in the first  year of ownership as well as in each subsequent year of ownership to  fulfill the terms and conditions of the loan agreement with respect to  the amount and timing of payments of interest and original issue  discount and periodic payments of principal in each such year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> There are restrictions in the loan agreement on the disposal or  use of the property consistent with the assumptions described in  subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cash flow defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``cash flow from the  property'' as used in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section means a  stream of revenue (as computed under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this  section) substantially all of which derives directly from the property.  The phrase ``cash flow from the property'' does not include revenue if a  significant portion thereof is derived from activities such as sales,  labor, services, or the use of other property. Thus, revenue derived  from the sale or lease of inventory or of similar property does not  constitute cash flow from the property, including plant or equipment  used in the manufacture and sale or lease, or purchase and sale or  lease, of such inventory or similar property. In addition, revenue  derived in part from the performance of services that are not ancillary  and subsidiary to the use of property does not constitute cash flow from  the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Self-constructed assets. The activities associated with self- construction of assets shall be considered to constitute labor or  services for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) only if the self- constructed asset--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is constructed for the purpose of resale, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Without regard to purpose, is sold to an unrelated person within  one year from the date that the property is placed in service for  purposes of section 167.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of cash flow. Cash flow is computed by subtracting  cash   disbursements excluding debt service from cash receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Analysis of operating costs.

In 1987, X borrows $100,000 in order to purchase an  apartment building, which X then purchases. The loan is secured only by  the building and the leases thereon. Annual debt service on the loan is  $12,000. Annual gross rents from the building are $20,000. Annual taxes  on the building are $2,000. Other expenses deductible under section 162  are $2,000. Rents are reasonably expected to remain stable or increase  in subsequent years, and taxes and expenses are reasonably expected to  remain proportional to gross rents in subsequent years. X provides  security, maintenance, and utilities to the tenants of the building.  Based on facts and circumstances, it is determined that, although  services are provided to tenants, these services are ancillary and  subsidiary to the occupancy of the apartments. Accordingly, the case  flow of $16,000 is considered to constitute a return from the property.  Furthermore, such cash flow is sufficient to fulfill the terms and  conditions of the loan agreement as required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1987, X borrows funds in order to purchase a hotel,  which X then purchases and operates. The loan is secured only by the  hotel. Based on facts and circumstances, it is determined that the  operation of the hotel involves services the value of which is  significant in relation to amounts paid to occupy the rooms. Thus, a  significant portion of the cash flow is derived from the performance of  services incidental to the occupancy of hotel rooms. Accordingly, the  cash flow from the hotel is considered not to constitute a return on or  from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 1987, X borrows funds in order to build a factory,  which X then builds and operates. The loan is secured only by the  factory and the equipment therein. Based on the facts and circumstances,  it is determined that the operation of the factory involves significant  expenditures for labor and raw materials. Thus, a significant portion of  the cash flow is derived from labor and the processing of raw materials.  Accordingly, the cash flow from the factory is considered not to  constitute a return on or from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exclusions.

Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, the term ``credit enhancement''  refers to any device, including a contract, letter of credit, or  guaranty, that expands the creditor's rights, directly or indirectly,  beyond the identified property purchased, constructed, or improved with  the funds advanced and, thus effectively provides as security for a loan  the assets of any person other than the borrower. The acquisition of  bond insurance or any other contract of   suretyship by an initial or subsequent holder of an obligation shall  constitute credit enhancement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for leveraged leases. For purposes of this  paragraph (b), the term ``credit enhancement'' shall not include any  device under which any person that is not a related person within the  meaning of Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2) agrees to guarantee, without recourse to  the lessor or any person related to the lessor, a lessor's payment of  principal and interest on indebtedness that was incurred in order to  purchase or improve an asset that is depreciable tangible personal  property or depreciable tangible real property (and the land on which  such real property is situated) that is leased to a lessee that is not a  related person in a transaction that constitutes a lease for federal  income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Syndication of credit risk and sale of loan participations.  The term ``syndication of credit risk'' refers to an arrangement in  which one primary lender secures the promise of a secondary lender to  bear a portion of the primary lender's credit risk on a loan. The term  ``sale of loan participations'' refers to an arrangement in which one  primary lender divides a loan into several portions, sells and assigns  all rights with respect to one or more portions to participating  secondary lenders, and does not remain at risk in any manner with  respect to the portion assigned. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the  syndication of credit risk shall constitute credit enhancement because  the primary lender can look to secondary lenders for payment of the  loan, notwithstanding limitations on the amount of the secondary  lender's liability. Conversely, the sale of loan participations does not  constitute credit enhancement, because the holder of each portion of the  loan can look solely to the asset securing the loan and not to the  credit or other assets of any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Other arrangements that do not constitute cross  collateralization or credit enhancement. For purposes of paragraphs (b)  (6) and (7) of this section, the following arrangements do not  constitute cross collateralization or credit enhancement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Integrated projects. A taxpayer's pledge of multiple assets of  an integrated project, provided that the integrated project. An  integrated project consists of functionally related and geographically  contiguous assets that, as to the taxpayer, are used in the same trade  or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Insurance.

Extension of a creditor's security  interest to improvements made to the collateral, provided that the  extension does not constitute excess collateralization under paragraph  (b)(6), determined by taking into account the value of improvements at  the time the improvements are made and the value of the original  property at the time the loan was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Warranties of completion and maintenance. A taxpayer's warranty  to a creditor that it will complete construction or manufacture of the  collateral or that it will maintain the collateral in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Substitution of collateral. A taxpayer's right to substitute  collateral under any loan contract.

The principles of this paragraph (c) may be  demonstrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a manufacturer and does not constitute a financial  services entity as defined in the regulations under section 904. On  January 1, 1988, X borrows $100 for 6 months at an annual interest rate  of 10 percent. X identifies on its books and records by the close of  that day that the indebtedness is being incurred for the purpose of  making an investment that is intended to qualify as an integrated  financial transaction. On January 5, 1988, X uses the proceeds to  purchase a portfolio of stock that approximates the composition of the  Standard & Poor's 500 Index. On that day, X also enters into a forward  sale contract that requires X to sell the stock on June 1, 1988 for  $110. X identifies on its books and records by the close of January 5,  1988, that the portfolio stock purchases and the forward sale contract  constitute part of the integrated financial transaction with respect to  which the identified borrowing was incurred. Under Sec. 1.954-2T(h),  the income derived from the transaction would constitute income  equivalent to interest. Assuming that the return on the investment to be  derived on June 1, 1988, will be sufficient to pay the interest due on  June 1, 1988, the interest on the borrowing is directly allocated to the  gain from the investment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X does not constitute a financial services entity as  defined in the regulations under section 904. X is in the business of,  among other things, issuing credit cards to consumers and purchasing  from merchants who accept the X card the receivables of consumers who  make purchases with the X card. X borrows from Y in order to purchase X  credit card receivables from Z, a merchant. Assuming that the Y  borrowing satisfies the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, the transaction nonetheless cannot constitute an integrated  financial transaction because the purchase relates to the operation of  X's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that X  borrows in order to purchase the receivables of A, a merchant who does  not accept the X card and is not otherwise engaged directly or  indirectly in any business transaction with X. Because the borrowing is  not related to the operation of X's trade or business, the borrowing may  qualify as an integrated financial transaction if the other requirements  of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules. In applying paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section, the following special rules shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Related person transactions. The rules of this section shall not  apply to the extent that any transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Involves either indebtedness between related persons (as defined  in section Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2)) or indebtedness incurred from unrelated  persons for the purpose of purchasing property from a related person; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Involves the purchase of property that is leased to a related  person (as defined in Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2)) in a transaction described  in paragraph (b) of this section. If a taxpayer purchases property and  leases such property in whole or in part to a related person, a portion  of the interest incurred in connection with such an acquisition, based  on the ratio that the value of the property leased to the related person  bears to the total value of the property, shall not qualify for direct  allocation under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. In apportioning  interest expense under the modified gross income method, gross income  shall be reduced by the amount of income to which interest expense is  directly allocated under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. This computation shall be performed as follows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Step 1: Compute the debt-to-asset ratio of the related United  States shareholder. The debt-to-asset ratio of the related United States  shareholder is the ratio between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The average month-end debt level of the related United States  shareholder taking into account debt owing to any obligee who is not a  related person as defined in section Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The value of assets (tax book or fair market) of the related  United States shareholder including stockholdings and obligations of  related controlled foreign corporations but excluding stockholdings and  obligations of   members of the affiliated group (as defined in Sec. 1.861-11T(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2: Compute aggregate debt-to-asset ratio of all related  controlled foreign corporations. The aggregate debt-to-asset ratio of  all related controlled foreign corporations is the ratio between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The average aggregate month-end debt level of all related  controlled foreign corporations for their taxable years ending during  the related United States shareholder's taxable year taking into account  only indebtedness owing to persons other than the related United States  shareholder or the related United States shareholder's other related  controlled foreign corporations (``third party indebtedness''), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The aggregate value (tax book or fair market) of the assets of  all related controlled foreign corporations for their taxable years  ending during the related United States shareholder's taxable year  excluding stockholdings in and obligations of the related United States  shareholder or the related United States shareholder's other related  controlled foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3: Compute aggregate related person debt of all related  controlled foreign corporations. This amount equals the average  aggregate month-end debt level of all related controlled foreign  corporations for their taxable years ending with or within the related  United States shareholder's taxable year, taking into account only debt  which is owned to the related United States shareholder (``related  person indebtedness'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(A)</em>, the term ``applicable percentage'' means the  designated percentages for taxable years beginning during the following  calendar years:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Applicable</p><p class="depth0">Taxable years beginning in                   percentage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1988........................................................         50 1989........................................................         65 1990 and thereafter.........................................         80 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Elective quadratic formula. In calculating the amount of excess  related party indebtedness of related controlled foreign corporations,  the United States shareholder's debt-to-asset ratio may be adjusted to  reflect the amount by which its debt and assets would be reduced had the  related controlled foreign corporations incurred the excess related  party indebtedness directly to third parties. In such case, the ratio  computed in Step 1 is adjusted to reflect a reduction of both portions  of the ratio by the amount of excess related person indebtedness as  computed under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A). Excess related person  indebtedness may be computed under the following formula, under which  excess related person indebtedness equals the smallest positive amount  (not exceeding the aggregate amount of related controlled foreign  corporation indebtedness) that is a solution to the following formula  (with X equalling the amount of excess related person indebtedness): [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.117      Guidance concerning the solution of this equation is set forth in  Example (2) of Sec. 1.861-12(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Computation of interest income received on excess related party  indebtedness. The amount of interest income received on excess related  person indebtedness equals the total interest income on related person  indebtedness derived by the related United States shareholder during the  taxable year multiplied by the ratio of excess related person  indebtedness over the aggregate related person indebtedness for the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, each debt obligation in a related  controlled foreign corporation held by a related United States  shareholder shall be attributed to separate limitation categories in the  same manner as the stock of the obligor would be attributed under the  rules of Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3), whether or nor such stock is held  directly by such related United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Step 6: Direct allocation of United States shareholder third  party interest expense. Third party interest expense of the related  United States shareholder equal to the amount of interest income  received on excess related person indebtedness as determined in step 4  shall be allocated among the various separate limitation categories in  proportion to the relative aggregate amount of related controlled  foreign corporation obligations held by the related United States  shareholder in each such category, as determined under step 5. The  remaining portion of third party interest expense will be apportioned as  provided in Sec. Sec. 1.861-8T through 1.861-13T, excluding this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i))</em> with respect to which related controlled  foreign corporations (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this  section) are related within the meaning of that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Related controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this  section, the term ``related controlled foreign corporation'' means any  controlled foreign corporation which is a related person (as defined in  Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2)) to a United States shareholder (as defined  paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Value of assets and amount of liabilities. For purposes of  this section, the value of assets is determined under Sec. 1.861-9T(g).  Thus, in the case of assets that are denominated in foreign currency,  the average of the beginning-of-year and end-of-year values is  determined in foreign currency and translated into dollars using  exchange rates on the last day of the related United States  shareholder's taxable year. In the case of liabilities that are  denominated in foreign currency, the average month-end debt level of  such liabilities is determined in foreign currency and then translated  into dollars using exchange rates on the last day of the related United  States shareholder's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of certain stock. To the extent that there is  insufficient related person indebtedness of all related controlled  foreign corporations under step 3 in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this  section to achieve as equal ratio in step 4 of paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of  this section, certain stock held by the related United States  shareholder will be treated as related person indebtedness. Such stock  includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any stock in the related controlled foreign corporation that is  treated in the same manner as debt under the law of any foreign country  that grants a deduction for interest or original issue discount relating  to such stock, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any stock in a related controlled foreign corporation that has  made loans to, or held stock described in this paragraph (e)(3) in,  another related controlled foreign corporation. However, such stock  shall be treated as related person indebtedness only to the extent of  the principal amount of such loans.  For purposes of computing income from excess related person indebtedness  in step 4 of paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, stock that is treated  under this paragraph as related person indebtedness shall be considered  to yield interest in an amount equal to the interest that would be  computed on an equal amount of indebtedness under section 1274. Only  dividends actually paid thereon shall be included in gross income for  other purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments to assets in apportioning other interest expense. In  apportioning interest expense under Sec. 1.861-9T, the value of assets  in each separate limitation category for the taxable year as determined  under Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(3) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the  principal amount of third party indebtedness of the related United  States shareholder the interest expense on which is allocated to each  such category under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Per company rule. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A related controlled foreign corporation with obligations owing  to a related United States shareholder has a greater proportion of  passive assets than the proportion of passive assets held by the related  United States shareholder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such passive assets are held in liquid or short term  investments, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> There are frequent cash transfers between the related controlled  foreign corporation and the related United States shareholder,  the Commissioner, in his discretion, may choose to exclude such a  corporation from other related controlled foreign corporations in the  application of the rules of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, then paragraph (e) shall not apply to any extent to any  interest expense of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general, the rules of this  section apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) (providing an operating costs test for  purposes of the nonrecourse indebtedness exception) and (b)(6)  (concerning excess collaterization of nonrecourse borrowings) of this  section are applicable for taxable years commencing after December 31,  1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Paragraph (e) (concerning the treatment of related controlled  foreign corporation indebtedness) of this section is applicable for  taxable years commencing after December 31, 1987.
