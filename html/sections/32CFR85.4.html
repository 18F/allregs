This does not prevent accepting support from these manufacturers or distributors for worthwhile programs benefiting military personnel when no advertised cooperation between the Departmment of Defense and the manufacturer or distributor directly or indirectly identifying an alcohol or tobacco product with the program is required. Neither does it prevent the participation of military personnel in programs, activities, or contests approved by the manufacturers or distributors of such products when that participation is incidental to general public participation.</p>
