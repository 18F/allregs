                            <p class="depth0">A mixed case complaint is a complaint of employment discrimination  filed with the Board based on race, color, religion, sex, national  origin, age or disability related to or stemming from an action that can  be appealed to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB). The complaint  may contain only an allegation of employment discrimination or it may  contain additional allegations that the MSPB has jurisdiction to  address. A mixed case appeal is an appeal filed with the MSPB that  alleges that an appealable Board action was effected, in whole or in  part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,  sex, national origin, disability or age. Only a Board employee who is a  preference eligible employee as defined by the Veterans Preference Act  can file a mixed case complaint with the Board or a mixed case appeal  with the MSPB. A mixed case complaint or mixed case appeal may only be  filed for action(s) over which the MSPB has jurisdiction. The Board will  apply sections 1614.302 to 1614.310 of 29 CFR to the processing of a  mixed case complaint or mixed case appeal.</p>
