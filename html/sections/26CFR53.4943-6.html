                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Paragraph (6) of section  4943(c) prescribes transition rules for a private foundation, which, but  for such paragraph, would have excess business holdings as a result of a  change in the holdings in a business enterprise after May 26, 1969  (other than by purchase by such private foundation or by a disqualified  person) to the extent that section 4943(c)(5) (relating to certain  holdings acquired under a pre-May 27, 1969, will on trust) does not  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subparagraph (A) of section 4943(c)(6) applies where,  immediately prior to a change in holdings described in paragraph  (a)(1)(i) of this section, the foundation has no excess business  holdings in such enterprise (determined without regard to section  4943(c) (4), (5), or (6)). In such a case, the entire interest of the  foundation in such enterprise (immediately after such change) shall  (while held by the foundation) be treated as held by a disqualified  person (rather than by the foundation) during the five-year period  beginning on the date of such change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subparagraph (B) of section 4943(c)(6) applies where the  foundation has excess business holdings in such enterprise (determined  without regard to section 4943(c) (4), (5), or (6)) immediately prior to  a change in holdings described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.  In such a case, the interest of the foundation in such enterprise  (immediately after such change) shall (while held by the foundation) be  treated as held by a disqualified person (rather than the foundation)  during the five-year period beginning on the date of such change, except  that if and as soon as any holdings in such enterprise become excess  business holdings during such period (determined without regard to such  change (and the resulting application of section 4943(c)(6) to the  foundation's interest in such enterprise)), such holdings shall no  longer be treated as held by a disqualified person under this section,  but shall constitute excess business holdings subject to the initial  tax. In applying the preceding sentence, if holdings of the foundation  which (but for such change in holdings (and the resulting application of  section 4943(c)(6) to the foundation's interest in such enterprise))  would be subject to the 25 percent limit prescribed by section  4943(c)(4)(D) after the expiration of the first phase, such holdings  shall be treated as subject to such percentage limitation for purposes  of determining excess business holdings. For example, if a private  foundation in 1978 has present holdings of 28 percent in a busines  enterprise to which section 4943(c)(4) applies, and such holdings would  exceed the 25 percent limit of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i) on May 26, 1979,  a gift of 5 percent to the foundation in 1978 of an interest in such  enterprise shall not prevent the 3 percent (28%-25%) excess over the 25  percent limit from constituting excess business holdings on May 26,  1979, if on such date disqualified persons hold more than a 2 percent  interest in such enterprise (and no other transaction has taken place).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions that are not purchases. Section 4943(c)(6) does not  apply if a change in holdings in a business enterprise is the result of  a purchase by the private foundation or a disqualified person. For  purposes of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the term ``purchase''  shall not include any acquisition by gift, devise, bequest, legacy, or  interstate succession. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for  the treatment of increases in holdings received in a readjustment (as  defined in Sec. 53.4943-7(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 4, 1985, A, an individual, makes a  contribution to F, a private foundation, of 200 shares of X Corporation  common stock. Assume that F had no X stock before January 4, 1985, and  under section 4943(c)(1) the receipt of the X stock by F would cause  some or all of the 200 shares of the X stock to be classified as excess  business holdings. Under the provisions of section 4943(c)(6)(A) and  this paragraph (a), since the contribution of the X stock to F is a gift  and not a purchase, the X stock in F's hands is treated as held by  disqualified persons and not by F through January 3, 1990.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in Example (1) except that F  receives the X stock as a bequest pursuant to the terms of A's will  executed on April 1, 1980. A dies on June 3, 1984, and the stock is  distributed to F on February 16, 1985. As in Example (1), the   bequest of X to F is not a purchase under this paragraph (a).  Consequently, the X stock in F's hands is treated as held by  disqualified persons and not by F through February 15, 1990.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On February 1, 1980, F, a private foundation, owns 15  percent of the voting stock of X Corporation, and disqualified persons  own 4 percent of the voting stock of X Corporation. On February 2, 1980,  B, a nondisqualified person, contributes 8 percent of the voting stock  of X to F in a transaction to which section 4943(c)(5) does not apply.  Assuming that the 35 percent limit of section 4943(c)(2)(B) does not  apply, under the provisions of section 4943(c)(6)(A) and paragraph (a)  of this section the 23 percent voting stock owned by F on such date is  treated as held by a disqualified person through February 1, 1985, since  F would have had excess business holdings of 7 percent as a result of  the contribution (23% actual holdings less 16% (20%-4%) permitted  holdings). On March 1, 1984, C, another nondisqualified person,  contributes 6 percent of the voting stock of X Corporation to F. But for  this second contribution and the resulting application of section  4943(c)(6) to F's interest in X, F would have excess business holdings  of 7 percent (23%-16%) within the five-year period beginning on the date  of such contribution. Accordingly, under section 4943(c)(6)(B) and  paragraph (a) of this section, all 29 percent (6%+23%) of the stock held  by F on March 1, 1984, will be treated as held by a disqualified person  until March 1, 1989, except that 7 percent will cease to be so treated  on February 2, 1985. If prior to February 2, 1985, no further  transactions occurred in the stock of X, F would have excess business  holdings of 7 percent subject to the initial tax, since the amount still  treated as held by disqualified persons (29%-7%) plus the amount  actually held by disqualified persons (4%) already exceed 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> apply is  constructively held by a private foundation under section 4943(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and  Sec. 53.4943-8 prior to the date of distribution, it shall be treated  as held by a disqualified person prior to such date by reason of section  4943(c)(6). See Sec. 53.4943-8 for rules relating to constructive  holdings held in an estate or trust for the benefit of the foundation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for section 4943(c)(5) interests acquired from a  nondisqualified person. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of holdings of a private  foundation in a business enterprise to which section 4943(c)(5)  (relating to certain holdings acquired under a pre-May 27, 1969, will or  trust) applies which are acquired from a nondisqualified person, the  interest of the foundation in such enterprise (immediately after such  acquisition) shall (while held by the foundation) be treated as held by  a disqualified person (rather than the foundation) under section  4943(c)(6)(B) and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section from the date of  acquisition until the end of the fifth year following the date of  distribution of such holdings. Thereafter, only the holdings to which  section 4943(c)(5) and Sec. 53.4943-5(a)(1) apply shall continue to be  treated as held by a disqualified person until the end of the first  phase with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On May 26, 1969, F, a private foundation, owns 5 percent  of the voting stock of Corporation X and no disqualified persons own any  stock in X. On June 30, 1977, a nondisqualified person bequeaths to F 33  percent of the voting stock in X to which section 4943(c)(5) applies.  This 33 percent interest is distributed to F on August 17, 1978. Under  section 4943(c)(6)(A) the entire 38 percent (5%+33%) of the X voting  stock shall be treated as held by a disqualified person from June 30,  1977 (the date the 33 percent interest   is contructively acquired by F) until August 17, 1983 (five years after  the date of distribution of the 33 percent interest to F). However,  assuming that the 35 percent limit of section 4943(c)(2)(B) does not  apply, the substituted combined voting level on June 30, 1977 is only 33  percent because there was no interest to which section 4943(c) (4) or  (5) applied immediately before that date and thus there was no  substituted combined voting level at that time. In that case, since the  3-phase holding period is only available for the interest acquired by  will (33%) under section 4943(c)(5), the substituted combined voting  level on June 30, 1977 is only 33 percent, not 38 percent. Assuming that  the substituted combined voting level remains 33 percent at all relevant  times, and prior to August 17, 1983, no further transactions occur in  the stock of X, F on that date would have excess business holdings of 5  percent subject to the initial tax. The amount treated as held by  disqualified persons at that time (33%) would equal the substituted  combined voting level at that time (33%), and thus permitted holdings  would be zero. Under section 4943(c)(5) the 33 percent interest will  continue to be treated as held by a disqualified person until August 17,  1988 (10 years after the date of distribution).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On May 26, 1969, F, a private foundation, owns 29 percent  of the stock (voting power and value) of Corporation X, and on June 30,  1977, a nondisqualified person bequeaths to F 23 percent of the stock  (voting power and value) in X to which section 4943(c)(5) does apply.  This 23 percent interest is distributed to F on August 17, 1978.  Disqualified persons hold no stock of X. Although the substituted  combined voting and value levels cannot exceed 50 percent on May 26,  1979 (at the start of the second phase with respect to the 29 percent  interest), under section 4943(c)(6)(B) the entire 52 percent (29%+23%)  of the X voting stock shall be treated as held by a disqualified person  from June 30, 1977 (the date the 23% interest is constructively acquired  by F) until August 17, 1983 (five years after the date of distribution  of the 23% interest to F). On June 1, 1980, during such second phase, D,  a disqualified person, purchases 3 percent of the X stock (voting power  and value). On such date, but for the acquisition by F of the 23 percent  interest, F would have had excess business holdings of 4 percent. The  purchase by D of more than 2 percent of the voting stock of X causes the  25 percent limit of section 4943(c)(4)(D)(i) to apply to the 29 percent  interest (29%-25%=4%). Thus, on June 1, 1980, 4 percent of the X voting  stock held by F since May 27, 1969, shall cease to be treated as held by  a disqualified person under section 4943(c)(6)(B) and become excess  business holdings subject to the initial tax. See Sec. 53.4943- 2(a)(1)(ii) for the 90-day period in which to dispose of these excess  business holdings resulting from the purchase by the disqualified  person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)</em> and this section shall not  apply to any transfer of holdings in a business enterprise by one  private foundation to another private foundation which is related to the  first foundation within the meaning of section 4946(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(H)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 4943(c)(6) and this section shall not apply to an  increase in the holdings of a private foundation in a business  enterprise that is part of a plan whereby disqualified persons will  purchase additional holdings in the same enterprise during the five-year  period beginning on the date of such change, e.g., to maintain control  of such enterprise, since such increase shall be treated as caused in  part by the purchase of such additional holdings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The purchase of holdings by an entity whose holdings are treated  as constructively owned by a foundation, its disqualified persons, or  both, under section 4943(d)(1) shall be treated as a purchase by a  disqualified person if the foundation, its disqualified persons or both  have effective control of the entity or otherwise can control the  purchase. For example, if a foundation is the beneficiary of a specific  bequest of $20,000 and its consent is required for the estate to make a  purchase using such cash, then a purchase by the estate using such cash  would be treated as a purchase by a disqualified person. Similarly, if  an executor of an estate is a disqualified person with respect to a  private foundation, any purchase by the estate would be treated as a  purchase by a disqualified person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a private foundation, its disqualified persons, or both, hold  an interest in specific property under the terms of a will or trust, and  if the private foundation, its disqualified persons, or both, consent or  otherwise agree to the substitution of holdings in a business enterprise  for such specific property, such holdings shall be treated as acquired  by purchase by a disqualified person. For example, if a private  foundation is the beneficiary of a specific bequest of $20,000 and the  private foundation agrees to accept certain of the estate's holdings in  a business enterprise in satisfaction of such   specific bequest, such holdings will be treated as acquired by purchase  by a disqualified person even if such holdings were held by the  decedent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em> shall be treated as  acquired other than by purchase. However, holdings that are attributable  to holdings owned by the private foundation that would have been excess  business holdings except for the fact that such holdings were treated as  held by a disqualified person prior to the readjustment shall in no  event be treated as held by a disqualified person after the date on  which the holdings to which the change is attributable would have ceased  to be treated as held by a disqualified person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. Any increase in holdings in a business enterprise  that is the result of a readjustment (as defined in Sec. 53.4943- 7(d)(1)), including any change resulting from application of the rule in  Sec. 53.4943-8(c)(3), shall be treated as occurring by purchase by a  disqualified person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the extent the increase is attributable to holdings that were  excess business holdings prior to the readjustment, and separately</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the full extent of the increase if the readjustment includes  a prohibited transaction, unless the foundation establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissoner that effective control of all parties to  the transaction was, at the time of the transaction, in one or more  persons (other than the foundation) who are not disqualified persons  with respect to the foundation. See Sec. 53.4943-7(d)(2) for the  definition of prohibited transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 4943(c)(6) holdings. If, immediately prior to a  readjustment (as defined in Sec. 53.4943-7(d)(1)), a private foundation  has holdings in a business enterprise that are treated under section  4943(c)(6) as held by a disqualified person, then any holdings in a  business enterprise that are received in the readjustment in exchange  for such section 4943(c)(6) holdings shall be treated as the holdings  surrendered in the exchange to the same extent as provided in Sec.  53.4943-7 with respect to exchanges involving holdings to which section  4943(c) (4) or (5) applies. Rules similar to those in Sec. 53.4943- 7(a)(2) shall be applied to determine when holdings are treated as  surrendered or received in a readjustment for purposes of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Redemption by a corporation that is a disqualified person. If a  foundation holds an interest in a corporation that is a disqualified  person, an increase in the holdings of the private foundation, its  disqualified person, or both, as a result of a redemption or a purchase  of stock of the disqualified person corporation by such corporation  shall not be treated as acquired by purchase by a disqualified person  based solely on the status of the corporation as a disqualified person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> One percent rule for redemptions. If the holdings of a  foundation, its disqualified persons, or both, in a business enterprise  are increased as a result of one or more redemptions during any taxable  year then, unless the aggregate of such increases equals or exceeds one  percent of the outstanding voting stock or one percent of the value of  all outstanding shares of all classes of stock, the determination of  whether such increases cause the foundation to have excess business  holdings shall be made only at the close of the private foundation's  taxable year. The five-year period described in section 4943(c)(6) or  the 90-day period described in Sec. 53.4943-2(a)(1)(ii), whichever is  applicable, shall begin on the last day of such taxable year. If,  however, the aggregate of such increases equals or exceeds one percent  of the outstanding voting stock or one percent of the value of all  outstanding shares of all classes of stock, the determination of whether  such increases cause the foundation to have excess business holdings  shall be made, and the applicable five-year or 90-day period shall  begin, as of the date the increases, in the aggregate, equal or exceed  one percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated in  Sec. 53.4943-7(f) and by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, holds 20% of the voting  stock of X corporation, an active business enterprise. No disqualified   person with respect to F holds any X stock. In 1980, X redeems 10% of  its outstanding shares, increasing F's holdings to 22% of the X stock.  Assume the redemption by X is not a prohibited transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All of F's holdings before the redemption are permitted  holdings under section 4943(c)(2). There is no effective control of X by  third parties so the 35% permitted holdings rule is inapplicable. F's  holdings after the redemption exceed the permitted holdings under  section 4943 (c)(2) (20%). Because the increase is attributable to stock  that was permitted holdings prior to the readjustment, and the  readjustment does not involve a prohibited transaction, the 2% increase  in F's holdings of X stock is treated as acquired other than by  purchase. Therefore, under section 4943(c)(6) and this section, F will  have 5 years from the date of the redemption to dispose of the 2%  excess.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that  the 20% of X stock held by F was donated by X corporation, was worth  more than $5,000 and represented 20% of the contributions received by  the foundation through the end of the taxable year in which the gift of  stock was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X corporation is a disqualified person with respect to F under  section 4946(a)(1)(A). Under subparagraph (4), the redemption of X stock  is not treated as a purchase by a disqualified person merely because X  is a disqualified person with respect to F. Therefore the rules of this  paragraph apply as if the redemption were made by a corporation which is  not a disqualified person. The analysis and result are the same as in  Example (1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On May 1, 1990, F, a private foundation, received a  donation of 40% of the stock of X corporation, a business enterprise.  Neither F nor any disqualified person with respect to F holds any other  interest in X. On June 1, 1992, the X corporation redeemed F's 40%  interest in exchange for 100% of the stock of Y corporation, a wholly- owned subsidiary of X. Assume the redemption by X is not a prohibited  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 4943(c)(6), the X stock acquired by gift is  treated as held by disqualified persons through April 30, 1995. Under  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (d), 40% of the 100% interest in Y  received in exchange for F's 40% interest in X is treated as F's 40%  interest in X and is therefore treated as held by disqualified persons  through April 30, 1995. In addition, under subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph (d), the 60% interest in Y that represents an increase in  holdings above the 40% held before the readjustment will be treated as  acquired other than by purchase. However, F's 20% interest in X in  excess of 20% permitted holdings under 4943(c)(2) would have been excess  business holdings if such interest had not been treated as held by as  disqualified person on June 1, 1992. Therefore, to the extent of a 30%  interest in Y, (i.e. , the portion of the increased holdings in Y  attributable to F's 20% holdings in X) the increased holdings will be  treated as held by disqualified person only through April 30, 1995,  since this is the latest date on which F's original 40% interest in X  would have been treated as held by disqualified persons. The remaining  30% interest in Y will be treated as held by disqualified persons for  five years from the date of the exchange (through May 31, 1997).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Constructive holdings. Any change in holdings in a business  enterprise that occurs because a corporation ceases to be actively  engaged in a trade or business, thus causing its holdings to be  constructively owned by its shareholders, shall be treated as acquired  other than by purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain transactions treated as purchases; cross references. For  the application of section 4943(c)(6) to holdings that were not an  interest in a business enterprise when acquired but that subsequently  become holdings in a business enterprise, see Sec. 53.4943-10(d)(2).
