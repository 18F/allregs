                                Sec. 93.118  Criteria and procedures: Motor vehicle emissions budget.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The transportation plan, TIP, and project not from a conforming  transportation plan and TIP must be consistent with the motor vehicle  emissions budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or  implementation plan submission). This criterion applies as described in  Sec. 93.109(c) through (g). This criterion is satisfied if it is  demonstrated that emissions of the pollutants or pollutant precursors  described in paragraph (c) of this section are less than or equal to the  motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established in the applicable  implementation plan or implementation plan submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be  demonstrated for each year for which the applicable (and/or submitted)  implementation plan specifically establishes a motor vehicle emissions  budget(s), and for each year for which a regional emissions analysis is  performed to fulfill the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section,  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Until a maintenance plan is submitted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Emissions in each year (such as milestone years and the  attainment year) for which the control strategy implementation plan  revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be less than  or equal to that year's motor vehicle emissions budget(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Emissions in years for which no motor vehicle emissions  budget(s) are specifically established must be less than or equal to the  motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established for the most recent prior  year. For example, emissions in years after the attainment year for  which the implementation plan does not establish a budget must be less  than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for the  attainment year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a maintenance plan has been submitted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Emissions must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle  emissions budget(s) established for the last year of the maintenance  plan, and for any other years for which the maintenance plan establishes  motor vehicle emissions budgets. If the maintenance plan does not  establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for any years other than the  last year of the maintenance plan, the demonstration of consistency with  the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be accompanied by a  qualitative finding that there are no factors which would cause or  contribute to a new violation or exacerbate an existing violation in the  years before the last year of the maintenance plan. The interagency  consultation process required by Sec. 93.105 shall determine what must  be considered in order to make such a finding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For years after the last year of the maintenance plan,  emissions must be less than or equal to the maintenance plan's motor  vehicle emissions budget(s) for the last year of the maintenance plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an approved and/or submitted control strategy  implementation plan has established motor vehicle emissions budgets for  years in the time frame of the transportation plan, emissions in these  years must be less than or equal to the control strategy implementation  plan's motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for these years; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For any analysis years before the last year of the maintenance  plan, emissions must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle  emissions budget(s) established for the most recent prior year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be  demonstrated for each pollutant or pollutant precursor in Sec. 93.102(b)  for which the area is in nonattainment or maintenance and for which the  applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission)  establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be  demonstrated by including emissions from the entire transportation  system, including all regionally significant projects contained in the  transportation plan and all other regionally significant highway and  transit projects expected in the nonattainment or maintenance area in  the timeframe of the transportation plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regional emissions analysis may be performed for any years  in the timeframe of the conformity determination (as described under  Sec. 93.106(d)) provided they are not more than ten years apart and  provided the analysis is performed for the attainment year (if it is in  the timeframe of the transportation plan and conformity determination)  and the last year of the timeframe of the conformity determination.  Emissions in years for which consistency with motor vehicle emissions  budgets must be demonstrated, as required in paragraph (b) of this  section, may be determined by interpolating between the years for which  the regional emissions analysis is performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the timeframe of the conformity determination is shortened  under Sec. 93.106(d)(2), the conformity determination must be  accompanied by a regional emissions analysis (for informational purposes  only) for the last year of the transportation plan, and for any year  shown to exceed motor vehicle emissions budgets in a prior regional  emissions analysis (if such a year extends beyond the timeframe of the  conformity determination).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted control strategy  implementation plan revisions and submitted maintenance plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted  control strategy implementation plan revisions or maintenance plans must  be demonstrated if EPA has declared the motor vehicle emissions  budget(s) adequate for transportation conformity purposes, and the  adequacy finding is effective. However, motor vehicle emissions budgets  in submitted implementation plans do not supersede the motor vehicle  emissions budgets in approved implementation plans for the same Clean  Air Act requirement and the period of years addressed by the previously  approved implementation plan, unless EPA specifies otherwise in its  approval of a SIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If EPA has not declared an implementation plan submission's  motor vehicle emissions budget(s) adequate for transportation conformity  purposes, the budget(s) shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of  this section. Consistency with the previously established motor vehicle  emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated. If there are no previously  approved implementation plans or implementation plan submissions with  adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets, the interim emissions tests  required by Sec. 93.119 must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If EPA declares an implementation plan submission's motor  vehicle emissions budget(s) inadequate for transportation conformity  purposes after EPA had previously found the budget(s) adequate, and  conformity of a transportation plan or TIP has already been determined  by DOT using the budget(s), the conformity determination will remain  valid. Projects included in that transportation plan or TIP could still  satisfy Secs. 93.114 and 93.115, which require a currently conforming  transportation plan and TIP to be in place at the time of a project's  conformity determination and that projects come from a conforming  transportation plan and TIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EPA will not find a motor vehicle emissions budget in a  submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance  plan to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes unless the  following minimum criteria are satisfied:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or  maintenance plan was endorsed by the Governor (or his or her designee)  and was subject to a State public hearing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before the control strategy implementation plan or maintenance  plan was submitted to EPA, consultation among federal, State, and local  agencies occurred; full implementation plan documentation was provided  to EPA; and EPA's stated concerns, if any, were addressed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The motor vehicle emissions budget(s) is clearly identified  and precisely quantified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The motor vehicle emissions budget(s), when considered together  with all other emissions sources, is consistent with applicable  requirements for reasonable further progress, attainment, or maintenance  (whichever is relevant to the given implementation plan submission);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The motor vehicle emissions budget(s) is consistent with and  clearly related to the emissions inventory and the control measures in  the submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or  maintenance plan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Revisions to previously submitted control strategy  implementation plans or maintenance plans explain and document any  changes to previously submitted budgets and control measures; impacts on  point and area source emissions; any changes to established safety  margins (see Sec. 93.101 for definition); and reasons for the changes  (including the basis for any changes related to emission factors or  estimates of vehicle miles traveled).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Before determining the adequacy of a submitted motor vehicle  emissions budget, EPA will review the State's compilation of public  comments and response to comments that are required to be submitted with  any implementation plan. EPA will document its consideration of such  comments and responses in a letter to the State indicating the adequacy  of the submitted motor vehicle emissions budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) used to satisfy the  requirements of this section are established by an implementation plan  submittal that has not yet been approved or disapproved by EPA, the MPO  and DOT's conformity determinations will be deemed to be a statement  that the MPO and DOT are not aware of any information that would  indicate that emissions consistent with the motor vehicle emissions  budget will cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard;  increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any  standard; or delay timely attainment of any standard or any required  interim emission reductions or other milestones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em> of this  section to review the adequacy of an implementation plan submission:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When EPA reviews the adequacy of an implementation plan  submission prior to EPA's final action on the implementation plan,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will notify the public through EPA's website when EPA  receives an implementation plan submission that will be reviewed for  adequacy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The public will have a minimum of 30 days to comment on the  adequacy of the implementation plan submission. If the complete  implementation plan is not accessible electronically through the  internet and a copy is requested within 15 days of the date of the  website notice, the comment period will be extended for 30 days from the  date that a copy of the implementation plan is mailed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> EPA will publish a Federal Register notice to inform the public  of EPA's finding. If EPA finds the submission adequate, the effective  date of this finding will be 15 days from the date the notice is  published as established in the Federal Register notice, unless EPA is  taking a final approval action on the SIP as described in paragraph  (f)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> EPA will announce whether the implementation plan submission is  adequate or inadequate for use in transportation conformity on EPA's  website. The website will also include EPA's response to comments if any  comments were received during the public comment period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If after EPA has found a submission adequate, EPA has cause to  reconsider this finding, EPA will repeat actions described in paragraphs  (f)(1)(i) through (v) or (f)(2) of this section unless EPA determines  that there is no need for additional public comment given the  deficiencies of the implementation plan submission. In all cases where  EPA reverses its previous finding to a finding of inadequacy under  paragraph (f)(1) of this section, such a finding will become effective  immediately upon the date of EPA's letter to the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If after EPA has found a submission inadequate, EPA has cause  to reconsider the adequacy of that budget, EPA will repeat actions  described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (v) or (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When EPA reviews the adequacy of an implementation plan  submission simultaneously with EPA's approval or disapproval of the  implementation plan,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA's Federal Register notice of proposed or direct final  rulemaking will serve to notify the public that EPA will be reviewing  the implementation plan submission for adequacy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking will start  a public comment period of at least 30 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>  through (v) of this section. If EPA makes an adequacy finding through a  final rulemaking that approves the implementation plan submission, such  a finding will become effective upon the publication date of EPA's  approval in the Federal Register, or upon the effective date of EPA's  approval if such action is conducted through direct final rulemaking.  EPA will respond to comments received directly and review comments  submitted through the State process and include the response to comments  in the applicable docket.
