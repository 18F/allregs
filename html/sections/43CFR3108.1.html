                            <p class="depth0">You may relinquish your lease or any legal subdivision of your lease at any time. You must file a written relinquishment with the BLM State Office with jurisdiction over your lease. All lessees holding record title interests in the lease must sign the relinquishment. A relinquishment takes effect on the date you file it with BLM. However, you and the party that issued the bond will continue to be obligated to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Make payments of all accrued rentals and royalties, including payments of compensatory royalty due for all drainage that occurred before the relinquishments;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Place all wells to be relinquished in condition for suspension or abandonment as BLM requires; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complete reclamation of the leased sites after stopping or abandoning oil and gas operations on the lease, under a plan approved by the appropriate surface management agency.
