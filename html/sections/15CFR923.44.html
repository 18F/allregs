The third such  control technique, at subsection 306(d)(11)(C) of the Act, is state  administrative review for consistency with the management program of all  development plans, projects, or land and water use regulations,  including exceptions and variances thereto, proposed by any state or  local authority or private developer, with power to approve or  disapprove after public notice and an opportunity for hearings (control  technique C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under case-by-case review, States have the power to review  individual development plans, projects or land and water use regulations  (including variances and exceptions thereto) proposed by any State or  local authority or private developer which have been identified in the  management program as being subject to review for consistency with the  management program. This control technique requires the greatest degree  of policy specificity because compliance with the program will not  require any prior actions on   the part of anyone affected by the program. Specificity also is needed  to avoid challenges that decisions (made pursuant to the management  program) are unfounded, arbitrary or capricious.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To have control technique C approved, a State must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the plans, projects or regulations subject to review,  based on their significance in terms of impacts on coastal resources,  potential for incompatibility with the State's coastal management  program, and having greater than local significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the State agency that will conduct this review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include the criteria by which identified plans, projects and  regulations will be approved or disapproved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have the power to approve or disapprove identified plans,  projects or regulations that are inconsistent with the management  program, or the power to seek court review thereof; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide public notice of reviews and the opportunity for public  hearing prior to rendering a decision on each case-by-case review.</p>
