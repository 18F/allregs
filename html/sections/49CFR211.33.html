These  include noncontroversial rules that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Affect internal procedures of the Federal Railroad  Administration, such as filing requirements and rules governing  inspection and copying of documents,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are nonsubstantive clarifications or corrections to existing  rules,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Update existing forms, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make minor changes in the substantive rules regarding statistics  and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal Register document will state that any adverse  comment or notice of intent to submit adverse comment must be received  in writing by the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified  time after the date of publication and that, if no written adverse  comment or request for oral hearing (if such opportunity is required by  statute) is received, the rule will become effective a specified number  of days after the date of publication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no adverse comment or request for oral hearing is received by  the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified time of  publication in the   Federal Register, the Federal Railroad Administration will publish a  notice in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse comment was  received and confirming that the rule will become effective on the date  that was indicated in the direct final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Federal Railroad Administration receives any written  adverse comment or request for oral hearing within the specified time of  publication in the Federal Register, a notice withdrawing the direct  final rule will be published in the final rule section of the Federal  Register and, if the Federal Railroad Administration decides a  rulemaking is warranted, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be  published in the proposed rule section of the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An ``adverse'' comment for the purpose of this subpart means any  comment that the Federal Railroad Administration determines is critical  of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a  change that should be made in the rule.
