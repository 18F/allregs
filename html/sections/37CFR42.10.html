For example, where the lead counsel is a registered  practitioner, a motion to appear pro hac vice by counsel who is not a  registered practitioner may be granted upon showing that counsel is an  experienced litigating attorney and has an established familiarity with  the subject matter at issue in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A panel of the Board may disqualify counsel for cause after  notice and opportunity for hearing. A decision to disqualify is not  final for the purposes of judicial review until certified by the Chief  Administrative Patent Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Counsel may not withdraw from a proceeding before the Board  unless the Board authorizes such withdrawal.
