                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions under which earnings and profits are counted toward a  minimum distribution--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A distribution to the United  States shareholder by a single first-tier corporation or by a foreign  corporation included in a chain or group shall count toward a minimum  distribution for the taxable year of such shareholder to which the  election under section 963 relates only to the extent that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is received by such shareholder during such year or within  180 days thereafter,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is a distribution of the type described in paragraph (b) of  this section,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c) of this section, it is deemed to be  distributed from the earnings and profits of the foreign corporations  for the taxable year of such corporation to which the election relates,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Such shareholder chooses to include it in gross income for the  taxable year of such shareholder to which the election relates  notwithstanding that such distribution, by reason of its receipt after  the close of such year, would ordinarily be includible in the gross  income of a subsequent year.  Amounts taken into account under this subparagraph as gross income of  the United States shareholder for the taxable year to which the election  relates shall not be considered to be includible in the gross income of  such shareholder for a subsequent taxable year. For purposes of  determining the foreign tax credit under sections 901 through 905,  foreign income tax paid or accrued by such shareholder on or with  respect to such amounts shall be treated as paid or accrued during the  taxable year of such election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 1.963-2, of such corporation's earnings  and profits for the taxable year and would have counted   toward a minimum distribution if it had been distributed to such United  States shareholder. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, which uses the calendar  year as the taxable year, has for 1963 $100 of earnings and profits and  100 shares of only one class of stock outstanding. Domestic corporation  M, not exempt from income tax under chapter 1 of the Code, directly owns  all of such shares during the period from January 1, 1963, through June  30, 1963. On June 30, 1963, M Corporation transfers all of such shares  to domestic corporation N, which owns them throughout the remainder of  1963 and elects to secure an exclusion under section 963 for such year  with respect to the subpart F income of A Corporation. During June 1963,  M Corporation receives a dividend of $75 from A Corporation, which would  count toward a minimum distribution if it had been distributed to N  Corporation for such year. Corporation N's proportionate share of the  earnings and profits of A Corporation for 1963 is $100; N Corporation  may count toward a minimum distribution for 1963 the entire dividend of  $75 paid to M Corporation.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that M is a  nonresident alien individual. Since A Corporation is not a controlled  foreign corporation from January 1, 1963, through June 30, 1963, N  Corporation's proportionate share of the earnings and profits of A  Corporation for 1963 is $50.41 ($100x184/365), as determined under  paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of Sec. 1.963-2. Although $25.41 ($75-$49.59) of  the $75 distribution to M is paid from N Corporation's proportionate  share of A Corporation's 1963 earnings and profits, N Corporation may  not count toward a minimum distribution any part of the $75 dividend  distributed to M, since M is not a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying distributions--(1) Amounts not counted toward a  minimum distribution. No distribution received by a United States  shareholder shall count toward a minimum distribution for the taxable  year with respect to such shareholder to the extent the distribution is  excludable from gross income to the extent gain on the distribution is  not recognized, or to the extent the distribution is treated as a  distribution in part or full payment in exchange for stock.  Undistributed amounts required to be included in gross income under  section 551 as undistributed foreign personal holding company income or  under section 951 as undistributed amounts of a controlled foreign  corporation shall not count toward a minimum distribution under section  963. An amount received by a United States shareholder as a distribution  which under section 302 or section 331 is treated as a distribution in  part or full payment in exchange for stock shall not count toward a  minimum distribution even though such amount is includible in gross  income under section 1248 as a dividend. For purposes of this  subparagraph, any portion of a distribution of earnings and profits  which is attributable to an increase in current earnings, invested in  United States property which, but for paragraph (e) of this section,  would be included in the gross income of the United States shareholder  under section 951(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)</em> shall not be treated as an amount excludable  from gross income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inclusion of tax on intercorporate distributions. In the case of  a chain or group election, the United States shareholder's proportionate  share of the amount of the foreign income tax paid or accrued for the  taxable year by a foreign corporation in the chain or group with respect  to distributions received by such corporation from the earnings and  profits, of another foreign corporation in such chain or group, for the  taxable year of such other corporation to which the election relates  shall count toward a minimum distribution from such chain or group for  the taxable year, but only if the United States shareholder does not  choose under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.963-2 to take such tax into  account in determining the effective foreign tax rate of such chain or  group for the taxable year. To the extent that foreign income tax counts  toward a minimum distribution under this subparagraph, it shall be  applied against and reduce the amount of the minimum distribution  required to be received by the United States shareholder, determined  without regard to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rules for allocation of distributions to earnings and profits  for a taxable year. To determine whether a distribution to the United  States shareholder by a single first-tier corporation or by a foreign  corporation in a chain or group is made from the earnings and profits of  such corporation for the taxable year   to which the election under section 963 relates, the following  subparagraphs shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exception to section 316. Section 316 shall apply except that a  distribution of earnings and profits made by a foreign corporation  either to another foreign corporation or to the United States  shareholder shall be treated as having been paid from the earnings and  profits of the distributing corporation for the taxable year of such  corporation to which the election relates only if it is made during its  distribution period (described in paragraph (g) of this section) for  such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Distributions from other corporations. The earnings and profits  of a foreign corporation shall be determined in accordance with  paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 1.963-2 (applied as though the United States  shareholder had chosen under subparagraph (1)(iii) of such paragraph to  take the tax described therein into account in determining the effective  foreign tax rate) except that, in the case of a chain or group election,  a distribution received by a foreign corporation in the chain or group  from another foreign corporation in such chain or group shall be taken  into account as earnings and profits of the recipient corporation for  the taxable year of such recipient corporation to which the election  relates but only to the extent that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The distribution is received by the recipient corporation during  the distribution period for the taxable year of such recipient  corporation to which the election relates,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the distribution had been received by the United States  shareholder, it would have constituted a distribution of the type  described in paragraph (b) of this section, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The distribution is made from the earnings and profits of the  distributing corporation for the taxable year of such distributing  corporation to which the election relates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)(iii)</em> of Sec. 1.963-2 to take the tax described therein  into account in determining the effective foreign tax rate). However,  for such purpose, the amount of foreign income tax, if any, which counts  toward the minimum distribution shall be determined without regard to  paragraph (b)(2) of this section but in accordance with paragraph  (b)(3)(iii) of Sec. 1.963-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distribution of current earnings invested in United States  property. A distribution made by a foreign corporation during its  distribution period for a taxable year shall, notwithstanding section  959(c), first be attributed to earnings and profits for such year  described in section 959(c)(3) and then to other earnings and profits.  For such purposes, earnings and profits of such foreign corporation for  such year attributable to amounts which would otherwise be included in  gross income of the United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(B)  for such year shall be treated as earnings and profits to which section  959(c)(3) applies, shall not be excluded from gross income under section  959 (a) or (b), and shall count toward a minimum distribution for such  year. See paragraph (c)(1)(v) of Sec. 1.960-1 and paragraph (a) of  Sec. 1.960-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cumulative dividends in arrears. A distribution in satisfaction  of arrearages shall be treated as being made out of earnings and profits  of the foreign corporation for the taxable year to which the election  under section 963   applies only to the extent the dividend is not attributed, under  paragraph (d)(2)(i)(d) of Sec. 1.963-2, to the earnings and profits of  such corporation remaining from prior taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1962. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. For 1963, single first-tier corporation A, which uses the  calendar year as the taxable year, has earnings and profits of $50; for  1964, a deficit in earnings and profits of $20; for 1965, earnings and  profits of $100; and for 1966, earnings and profits of $240. For each of  such years preferred dividends accumulate at the rate of $60; but no  dividend is paid until 1966 during which year the current dividend is  paid and $180 is distributed toward the arrearages. Of this $180, only  $50 ($180-$130) shall be treated as paid from 1966 earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Distribution period of a foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General  distribution period. Except as provided by subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, the distribution period with respect to a foreign corporation  for its taxable year shall begin immediately after the close of the  distribution period for the preceding taxable year and shall end with  the close of the 60th day of the next succeeding taxable year. If no  election to secure an exclusion under section 963 applied to the  preceding taxable year, the distribution period for the taxable year  shall begin with the 61st day of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special extended distribution period. If the United States  shareholder of the foreign corporation so elects in statement filed with  its return for the taxable year for which the election to secure the  exclusion under section 963 is made, the distribution period with  respect to such foreign corporation for its taxable year to which the  election to secure the exclusion applies shall end with any day which  occurs no earlier than the last day of such taxable year of such foreign  corporation and no later than the 180th day after the close of such  taxable year. The statement shall designate the day so elected as the  end of the distribution period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. For 1963 domestic corporation M makes a chain election  with respect to controlled foreign corporation A, all of whose one class  of stock M Corporation directly owns, and controlled foreign corporation  B, all of whose one class of stock is directly owned by A Corporation.  All such corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year, and the  distribution periods of corporations A and B for 1963 coincide.  Corporations A and B each have earnings and profits (before  distributions) of $100 for 1963. On June 1, 1963, B Corporation  distributes earnings and profits of $120, of which $100 is from its  earnings and profits for 1963 and $20 is from prior earnings. For 1963,  A Corporation pays no income tax and distributes earnings and profits of  $150 to M Corporation. Under paragraph (c) of this section, such $150 is  allocated to A Corporation's earnings and profits of $200 for 1963,  consisting of its total earnings and profits for that year of $220 less  the $20 received as a distribution from B Corporation's prior earnings.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Domestic corporation M directly owns all of the one class  of stock of controlled foreign corporation A. Both corporations use the  calendar year as the taxable year, and A Corporation's taxable year and  its distribution period for 1963 coincide. For 1963, $50 is included in  the gross income of M Corporation under section 951(a)(1)(B) as A  Corporation's increase in earnings invested for such year in United  States property. For 1964, M Corporation makes a first-tier election  with respect to A Corporation. For 1964, A Corporation has earnings and  profits of $100, including $10 attributable to an increase in earnings  invested for such year in United States property. During 1964, A  Corporation distributes earnings and profits of $80 to M Corporation.  Without regard to paragraph (e) of this section, $10 of this  distribution is attributable under section 959(c)(1) to A Corporation's  1964 earnings and profits required to be included in M Corporation's  gross income under section 951(a)(1)(D). Pursuant to paragraph (e) of  this section, however, the entire distribution of $80 counts toward a  minimum distribution for 1964 and is considered to be from earnings and  profits of A Corporation for 1964 described in section 959(c)(3). Thus  the entire distribution of $80 is included in M Corporation's gross  income as a dividend and the foreign tax credit in respect of such  amount is determined in accordance with section 902 as modified by the  regulations under section 963. On the other hand, if A Corporation made  no distributions for 1964, no part of the $10 of A Corporation's  increase in earnings invested in United States property for such year  would count toward a minimum distribution for any other year but would  be included in the gross income for M Corporation for 1964 under section  951(a)(1)(B), and the foreign tax credit in respect of such amount would  be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.960-1.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. For 1964 domestic corporation M makes a chain election  with respect to controlled foreign corporation A, all the one class of  stock of which is owned directly by M Corporation, and controlled  foreign corporation B, all the one class of stock of which is owned  directly by A Corporation. Corporation M makes no election under section  963 for 1963 or 1965. Corporations M and B use the calendar year as the  taxable year, and A Corporation uses for its taxable year a fiscal year  ending on September 30. Corporation M elects to have the distribution  period for each controlled foreign corporation end on March 29, 1965,  such date being the 180th day after the close of A Corporation's taxable  year ending on September 30, 1964. Corporation A's distribution period  for its taxable year ending on September 30, 1964, begins on November  30, 1963, the 61st day of such taxable year. The distribution period of  B Corporation for 1964 begins on March 1, 1964, the 61st day of such  taxable year. A distribution counting toward a minimum distribution for  1964 may be made from the earnings and profits of B Corporation only if  the amount thereof is distributed by B Corporation to A Corporation, and  in turn by A Corporation to M Corporation, during the period of March 1,  1964, through March 29, 1965.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that for  their taxable years ending in 1964, corporations A and B each have  earnings and profits (before distributions) of $100. On March 10, 1965,  B Corporation distributes to A Corporation a dividend of $80 upon which  A Corporation incurs foreign income tax at the rate of 10 percent. On  March 15, 1965, A Corporation distributes to M Corporation a dividend of  $50. Corporation M chooses to take into account as gross income for 1964  from such distribution only $40. For purposes of applying this section,  the distribution counting toward a minimum distribution is $44.44,  consisting of the $40 of earnings and profits actually received by M  Corporation plus the $4.44 ($40/$72x$8) of foreign income tax incurred  by A Corporation attributable thereto; A Corporation is deemed to have  received $44.44 ($40/0.90) of the distribution from B Corporation on  September 30, 1964, the last day of the taxable year of A Corporation to  which the election relates; and the foreign personal holding company  income derived by A Corporation for its taxable year ending in 1965 from  the distribution from B is only $35.56 ($80-$44.44). Assuming that no  exceptions, exclusions, or exemptions were applicable, subpart F income  would be realized by A Corporation for its taxable year ending on  September 30, 1965, upon the distribution by B Corporation to A  Corporation, but only in the amount of $32 ($35.56 less a deduction  under section 954(b)(5) for taxes of $3.56).  [T.D. 7100, 36 FR 10860, June 4, 1971; 36 FR 11924, June 23, 1971, as  amended by T.D. 7334, 39 FR 44214, Dec. 23, 1974]</p>
