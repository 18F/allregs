                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Date for submittal. Not later than November 15, 1993, the  Governor of each State shall submit to the Administrator for approval a  proposed part 70 program, under State law or under an interstate  compact, meeting the requirements of this part. If part 70 is  subsequently revised such that the Administrator determines that it is  necessary to require a change to an approved State program, the required  revisions to the program shall be submitted within 12 months of the  final changes to part 70 or within such other period as authorized by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Elements of the initial program submission. Any State that seeks  to administer a program under this part shall submit to the  Administrator a letter of submittal from the Governor or his designee  requesting EPA approval of the program and at least three copies of a  program submission. The submission shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A complete program description describing how the State intends  to carry out its responsibilities under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The regulations that comprise the permitting program, reasonably  available evidence of their procedurally correct adoption, (including  any notice of public comment and any significant comments received on  the proposed part 70 program as requested by the Administrator), and  copies of all applicable State or local statutes and regulations  including those governing State administrative procedures that either  authorize the part 70 program or restrict its implementation. The State  shall include with the regulations any criteria used to determine  insignificant activities or emission levels for purposes of determining  complete applications consistent with Sec. 70.5(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A legal opinion from the Attorney General for the State, or the  attorney for those State, local, or interstate air pollution control  agencies that have independent legal counsel, stating that the laws of  the State, locality, or interstate compact provide adequate authority to  carry out all aspects of the program. This statement shall include  citations to the specific states, administrative regulations, and, where  appropriate, judicial decisions that demonstrate adequate authority.  State statutes and regulations cited by the State Attorney General or  independent legal counsel shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State  states and regulations at the time the statement is signed and shall be  fully effective by the time the program is approved. To qualify as  ``independent legal counsel,'' the attorney signing the statement  required by this section shall have full authority to independently  represent the State agency in court on all matters pertaining to the  State program. The legal opinion shall also include a demonstration of  adequate legal authority to carry out the requirements of this part,  including authority to carry out each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable  requirement and requirement of this part by all part 70 sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incorporate monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and  compliance certification requirements into part 70 permits consistent  with Sec. 70.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Issue permits for a fixed term of 5 years in the case of  permits with acid rain provisions and issue all other permits for a  period not to exceed 5 years, except for permits issued for solid waste  incineration units combusting municipal waste subject to standards under  section 129(e) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Issue permits for solid waste incineration units combusting  municipal waste subject to standards under section 129(e) of the Act for  a period not to exceed 12 years and review such permits at least every 5  years. No permit for a solid waste incineration unit may be issued by an  agency, instrumentality or person that is also responsible, in whole or  in part, for the design and construction or operation of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Incorporate into permits all applicable requirements and  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue permits for cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Enforce permits, permit fee requirements, and the requirement  to obtain a permit, as specified in Sec. 70.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Make available to the public any permit application,  compliance plan, permit, and monitoring and compliance, certification  report pursuant to section 503(e) of the Act, except for information  entitled to confidential treatment pursuant to section 114(c) of the  Act. The contents of a part 70 permit shall not be entitled to  protection under section 115(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Not issue a permit if the Administrator timely objects to its  issuance pursuant to Sec. 70.8(c) of this part or, if the permit has  not already been issued, to Sec. 70.8(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Provide an opportunity for judicial review in State court of the  final permit action by the applicant, any person who participated in the  public   participation process provided pursuant to Sec. 70.7(h) of this part,  and any other person who could obtain judicial review of such actions  under State laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Provide that, solely for the purposes of obtaining judicial  review in State court for failure to take final action, final permit  action shall include the failure of the permitting authority to take  final action on an application for a permit, permit renewal, or permit  revision within the time specified in the State program. If the State  program allows sources to make changes subject to post hoc review [as  set forth in Sec. Sec. 70.7(e)(2) and (3) of this part], the permitting  authority's failure to take final action within 90 days of receipt of an  application requesting minor permit modification procedures (or 180 days  for modifications subject to group processing requirements) must be  subject to judicial review in State court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Provide that the opportunity for judicial review described in  paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this section shall be the exclusive means for  obtaining judicial review of the terms and conditions of permits, and  require that such petitions for judicial review must be filed no later  than 90 days after the final permit action, or such shorter time as the  State shall designate. Notwithstanding the preceding requirement,  petitions for judicial review of final permit actions can be filed after  the deadline designated by the State, only if they are based solely on  grounds arising after the deadline for judicial review. Such petitions  shall be filed no later than 90 days after the new grounds for review  arise or such shorter time as the State shall designate. If the final  permit action being challenged is the permitting authority's failure to  take final action, a petition for judicial review may be filed any time  before the permitting authority denies the permit or issues the final  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Ensure that the authority of the State/local permitting  Agency is not used to modify the acid rain program requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the  State regulations, including the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Copies of the permit form(s), application form(s), and reporting  form(s) the State intends to employ in its program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relevant guidance issued by the State to assist in the  implementation of its permitting program, including criteria for  monitoring source compliance (e.g., inspection strategies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and  enforcement program or reference to any agreement the State has with EPA  that provides this information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A showing of adequate authority and procedures to determine  within 60 days of receipt whether applications (including renewal  applications) are complete, to request such other information as needed  to process the application, and to take final action on complete  applications within 18 months of the date of their submittal, except for  initial permit applications, for which the permitting authority may take  up to 3 years from the effective date of the program to take final  action on the application, as provided for in the transition plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A demonstration, consistent with Sec. 70.9, that the permit  fees required by the State program are sufficient to cover permit  program costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A statement that adequate personnel and funding have been made  available to develop, administer, and enforce the program. This  statement shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description in narrative form of the scope, structure,  coverage, and processes of the State program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the organization and structure of the agency  or agencies that will have responsibility for administering the program,  including the information specified in this paragraph. If more than one  agency is responsible for administration of a program, the  responsibilities of each agency must be delineated, their procedures for  coordination must be set forth, and an agency shall be designated as a  ``lead agency'' to facilitate communications between EPA and the other  agencies having program responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the agency staff who will carry out the State  program, including the number, occupation, and general duties of the  employees. The   State need not submit complete job descriptions for every employee  carrying out the State program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of applicable State procedures, including  permitting procedures and any State administrative or judicial review  procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An estimate of the permit program costs for the first 4 years  after approval, and a description of how the State plans to cover those  costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A commitment from the State to submit, at least annually to the  Administrator, information regarding the State's enforcement activities  including, but not limited to, the number of criminal and civil,  judicial and administrative enforcement actions either commenced or  concluded; the penalties, fines, and sentences obtained in those  actions; and the number of administrative orders issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> A requirement under State law that, if a timely and complete  application for a permit renewal is submitted, consistent with Sec.  70.5(a)(2), but the State has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit  before the end of the term of the previous permit, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been  issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to  Sec. 70.6(f) may extend beyond the original permit term until renewal;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit  shield that may be granted pursuant to Sec. 70.6(f) shall remain in  effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> A transition plan providing a schedule for submittal and final  action on initial permit applications for all part 70 sources. This plan  shall provide that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submittal of permit applications by all part 70 sources  (including any sources subject to a partial or interim program) shall  occur within 1 year after the effective date of the permit program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Final action shall be taken on at least one-third of such  applications annually over a period not to exceed 3 years after such  effective date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any complete permit application containing an early reduction  demonstration under section 112(i)(5) of the Act shall be acted on  within 9 months of receipt of the complete application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Submittal of permit applications and the permitting of affected  sources shall occur in accordance with the deadlines in title IV of the  Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)(i)</em> through (iii)  of this section to allow changes within a permitted facility without  requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under  any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the  emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a  rate of emissions or in the terms of total emissions): Provided, That  the facility provides the Administrator and the permitting authority  with written notification as required below in advance of the proposed  changes, which shall be a minimum of 7 days, unless the permitting  authority provides in its regulations a different time frame for  emergencies. The source, permitting authority, and EPA shall attach each  such notice to their copy of the relevant permit. The following  provisions implement this requirement of an approvable part 70 permit  program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program shall allow permitted sources to make section  502(b)(10) changes without requiring a permit revision, if the changes  are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the  changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether  expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total  emissions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each such change, the written notification required above  shall include a brief description of the change within the permitted  facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in  emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable  as a result of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The permit shield described in Sec. 70.6(f) of this part shall  not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(12)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.  This provision is available in those cases where the permit does not  already provide for such emissions trading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section, the written  notification required above shall include such information as may be  required by the provision in the applicable implementation plan  authorizing the emissions trade, including at a minimum, when the  proposed change will occur, a description of each such change, any  change in emissions, the permit requirements with which the source will  comply using the emissions trading provisions of the applicable  implementation plan, and the pollutants emitted subject to the emissions  trade. The notice shall also refer to the provisions with which the  source will comply in the applicable implementation plan and that  provide for the emissions trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The permit shield described in Sec. 70.6(f) of this part shall  not extend to any change made under this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this  section. Compliance with the permit requirements that the source will  meet using the emissions trade shall be determined according to  requirements of the applicable implementation plan authorizing the  emissions trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The program shall require the permitting authority, if a  permit applicant requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and  conditions, including all terms required under Sec. 70.6 (a) and (c) of  this part to determine compliance, allowing for the trading of emissions  increases and decreases in the permitted facility solely for the purpose  of complying with a federally-enforceable emissions cap that is  established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable  requirements. The permit applicant shall include in its application  proposed replicable procedures and permit terms that ensure the  emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable. The permitting  authority shall not be required to include in the emissions trading  provisions any emissions units for which emissions are not quantifiable  or for which there are no replicable procedures to enforce the emissions  trades. The permit shall also require compliance with all applicable  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under this paragraph (b)(12)(iii) of this section, the written  notification required above shall state when the change will occur and  shall describe the changes in emissions that will result and how these  increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the terms and  conditions of the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The permit shield described in Sec. 70.6(f) of this part may  extend to terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases  in emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Provisions for adequate, streamlined, and reasonable procedures  for expeditious review of permit revisions or modifications. The program  may meet this requirement by using procedures that meet the requirements  of Sec. 70.7(e) or that are substantially equivalent to those provided  in Sec. 70.7(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> (i) through (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and  shall not violate any existing permit term or condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sources must provide contemporaneous written notice to the  permitting authority and EPA of each such change, except for changes  that qualify as insignificant under the provisions adopted pursuant to  Sec. 70.5(c) of this part. Such written notice shall describe each such  change, including the   date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted, and any applicable  requirement that would apply as a result of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The change shall not qualify for the shield under Sec.  70.6(f) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at  the source that result in emissions of a regulated air pollutant subject  to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the  permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Provisions prohibiting sources from making, without a permit  revision, changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the part 70  permit, if such changes are subject to any requirements under title IV  of the Act or are modifications under any provision of title I of the  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Provisions requiring the permitting authority to implement the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 70.6 and 70.7 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partial programs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The EPA may approve a partial program that  applies to all part 70 sources within a limited geographic area (e.g., a  local agency program covering all sources within the agency's  jurisdiction). To be approvable, any partial program must, at a minimum,  ensure compliance with all of the following applicable requirements, as  they apply to the sources covered by the partial program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All requirements of title V of the Act and of part 70;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All applicable requirements of title IV of the Act and  regulations promulgated thereunder which apply to affected sources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All applicable requirements of title I of the Act, including  those established under sections 111 and 112 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any partial permitting program, such as that of a local air  pollution control agency, providing for the issuance of permits by a  permitting authority other than the State, shall be consistent with all  the elements required in paragraphs (b) (1) through (16) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approval of any partial program does not relieve the State from  its obligation to submit a whole program or from application of any  sanctions for failure to submit a fully-approvable whole program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any partial program may obtain interim approval under paragraph  (d) of this section if it substantially meets the requirements of this  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interim approval. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a program (including a partial permit  program) submitted under this part substantially meets the requirements  of this part, but is not fully approvable, the Administrator may be rule  grant the program interim approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim approval shall expire on a date set by the Administrator  (but not later than 2 years after such approval), and may not be  renewed. Sources shall become subject to the program according to the  schedule approved in the State program. Permits granted under an interim  approval shall expire at the end of their fixed term, unless renewed  under a part 70 program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The EPA may grant interim approval to any program if it meets  each of the following minimum requirements and otherwise substantially  meets the requirements of this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adequate fees. The program must provide for collecting permit  fees adequate for it to meet the requirements of Sec. 70.9 of this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The program must provide for  adequate authority to issue permits that assure compliance with the  requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section for those major sources  covered by the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, where a  State or local permitting authority lacks adequate authority to issue or  revise permits that assure compliance with applicable requirements  established exclusively through an EPA-approved minor NSR program, EPA  may grant interim approval to the program upon a showing by the  permitting authority of compelling reasons which support the interim  approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any part 70 permit issued during an interim approval granted  under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section that does not incorporate  minor NSR requirements shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Note this fact in the permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indicate how citizens may obtain access to excluded minor NSR  permits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide a cross reference, such as a listing of the permit  number, for each minor NSR permit containing an excluded minor NSR term;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> State that the minor NSR requirements which are excluded are not  eligible for the permit shield under Sec. 70.6(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A program receiving interim approval for the reason specified in  (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section must, upon or before granting of full  approval, institute proceedings to reopen part 70 permits to incorporate  excluded minor NSR permits as terms of the part 70 permits, as required  by Sec. 70.7(f)(1)(iv). Such reopening need not follow full permit  issuance procedures nor the notice requirement of Sec. 70.7(f)(3), but  may instead follow the permit revision procedure in effect under the  State's approved part 70 program for incorporation of minor NSR permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> and (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Public participation. The program must provide for adequate  public notice of and an opportunity for public comment and a hearing on  draft permits and revisions, except for modifications qualifying for  minor permit modification procedures under Sec. 70.7(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> EPA and affected State review. The program must allow EPA an  opportunity to review each proposed permit, including permit revisions,  and to object to its issuance consistent with Sec. 70.8(c) of this  part. The program must provide for affected State review consistent with  Sec. 70.8(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Permit issuance. The program must provide that the proposed  permit will not be issued if EPA objects to its issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Enforcement. The program must contain authority to enforce  permits, including the authority to assess penalties against sources  that do not comply with their permits or with the requirement to obtain  a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Operational flexibility. The program must allow changes  within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, if the  changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the act  and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit,  consistent with paragraph (b)(12) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Streamlined procedures. The program must provide for  streamlined procedures for issuing and revising permits and determining  expeditiously after receipt of a permit application or application for a  permit revision whether such application is complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Permit application. The program submittal must include copies of  the permit application and reporting form(s) that the State will use in  implementing the interim program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Approval of AOSs. The program submittal must include provisions  to insure that AOSs requested by the source as approved by the  permitting authority are included in the part 70 permit pursuant to  Sec. 70.6(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> EPA review of permit program submittals. Within 1 year after  receiving a program submittal, the Administrator shall approve or  disapprove the program, in whole or in part, by publishing a notice in  the Federal Register. Prior to such notice, the Administrator shall  provide an opportunity for public comment on such approval or  disapproval. Any EPA action disapproving a program, in whole or in part,  shall include a statement of the revisions or modifications necessary to  obtain full approval. The Administrator shall approve State programs  that conform to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 60 days of receipt by EPA of a State program submission,  EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete enough to  warrant review by EPA for either full, partial, or interim approval. If  EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the 1-year review  period (i.e., the period of time allotted for formal EPA review of a  proposed State program) shall be deemed to have begun on the date of  receipt of the State's submission. If EPA finds that a State's  submission is incomplete, the 1-year review period shall not begin until  all the necessary information is received by EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the State's submission is materially changed during the 1- year review period, the Administrator may extend the review period for  no more than 1   year following receipt of the revised submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In any notice granting interim or partial approval, the  Administrator shall specify the changes or additions that must be made  before the program can receive full approval and the conditions for  implementation of the program until that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> State response to EPA review of program--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disapproval. The  State shall submit to EPA program revisions or modifications required by  the Administrator's action disapproving the program, or any part  thereof, within 180 days of receiving notification of the disapproval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim approval. The State shall submit to EPA changes to the  program addressing the deficiencies specified in the interim approval no  later than 6 months prior to the expiration of the interim approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. The effective date of a part 70 program,  including any partial or interim program approved under this part, shall  be the effective date of approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Individual permit transition. Upon approval of a State program,  the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for  those activities subject to the approved State program, except that the  Administrator will continue to issue phase I acid rain permits. After  program approval, EPA shall retain jurisdiction over any permit  (including any general permit) that it has issued unless arrangements  have been made with the State to assume responsibility for these  permits. Where EPA retains jurisdiction, it will continue to process  permit appeals and modification requests, to conduct inspections, and to  receive and review monitoring reports. If any permit appeal or  modification request is not finally resolved when the federally-issued  permit expires, EPA may, with the consent of the State, retain  jurisdiction until the matter is resolved. Upon request by a State, the  Administrator may delegate authority to implement all or part of a  permit issued by EPA, if a part 70 program has been approved for the  State. The delegation may include authorization for the State to collect  appropriate fees, consistent with Sec. 70.9 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Program revisions. Either EPA or a State with an approved  program may initiate a program revision. Program revision may be  necessary when the relevant Federal or State statutes or regulations are  modified or supplemented. The State shall keep EPA apprised of any  proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority or  procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Administrator determines pursuant to Sec. 70.10 of this  part that a State is not adequately administering the requirements of  this part, or that the State's permit program is inadequate in any other  way, the State shall revise the program or its means of implementation  to correct the inadequacy. The program shall be revised within 180 days,  or such other period as the Administrator may specify, following  notification by the Administrator, or within 2 years if the State  demonstrates that additional legal authority is necessary to make the  program revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revision of a State program shall be accomplished as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State shall submit a modified program description, Attorney  General's statement, or such other documents as EPA determines to be  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After EPA receives a proposed program revision, it will publish  in the Federal Register a public notice summarizing the proposed change  and provide a public comment period of at least 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator shall approve or disapprove program  revisions based on the requirements of this part and of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A program revision shall become effective upon the approval of  the Administrator. Notice of approval of any substantial revision shall  be published in the Federal Register. Notice of approval of  nonsubstantial program revisions may be given by a letter from the  Administrator to the Governor or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Governor of any State with an approved part 70 program shall  notify EPA whenever the Governor proposes to transfer all or part of the  program to any other agency, and shall identify any new division of  responsibilities among the agencies involved.   The new agency is not authorized to administer the program until the  revision has been approved by the Administrator under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that  circumstances have changed with respect to a State program, he may  request, and the State shall provide, a supplemental Attorney General's  statement, program description, or such other documents or information  as he determines are necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Sharing of information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any information obtained or used in  the administration of a State program shall be available to EPA upon  request without restriction and in a form specified by the  Administrator, including computer-readable files to the extent  practicable.
