                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Improper distribution or loss of or damage to donated food. If a  processor improperly distributes or uses any donated food, or causes  loss of or damage to a donated food through its failure to provide  proper storage, care, or handling, FNS shall require the processor to  pay to the Department the value of the donated food as determined by the  Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of damaged or out-of-condition food. Donated food  which is found to be damaged or out-of-condition and is declared unfit  for human consumption by Federal, State, or local health officials, or  by any other inspection services or persons deemed competent by the  Department, shall be disposed of in accordance with instructions of the  Department. This instruction shall direct that unfit donated food be  sold in a manner prescribed by the Department with the net proceeds  thereof remitted to the Department. Upon a finding by the Department  that donated food is unfit for human consumption at the time of delivery  to a recipient agency and when the Department or appropriate health  officials require that such donated food be destroyed, the processor  shall pay for any expenses incurred in connection with such donated food  as determined by the Department. The Department may, in any event,  repossess damaged or out-of-condition donated food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FNS sales verification. FNS may conduct a verification of  processor reported sales utilizing a statistically valid sampling  technique. If, as a result of this verification, FNS determines that the  value of the donated food has not been passed on to recipient agencies  or if end products have been improperly distributed, FNS may assert a  claim against the processor. This claim may include a projection of the  verification sample to the total NCP sales reported by the processor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sanctions. Any processor or recipient agency which has failed to  comply with the provisions of this part or any instructions or  procedures issued in connection herewith, or any agreements entered into  pursuant hereto, may, at the discretion of the Department, be  disqualified from further participation in the NCP Program.  Reinstatement may be made at the option of the Department.  Disqualification shall not prevent the Department from taking other  action through other available means when considered necessary,  including prosecution under applicable Federal statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Embezzlement, misuse, theft, or obtainment by fraud of  commodities and commodity related funds, assets, or property in child  nutrition programs. Whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or  obtains by fraud commodities donated for use in the NCP Program, or any  funds, assets, or property deriving   from such donations, or whoever receives, conceals, or retains such  commodities, funds, assets, or property for his own use or gain, knowing  such commodities, funds, assets, or property have been embezzled,  willfully misapplied, stolen, or obtained by fraud, shall be subject to  Federal criminal prosecution under section 12(g) of the National School  Lunch Act, as amended, or section 4(c) of the Agriculture and Consumer  Protection Act of 1973, as amended. For the purpose of this paragraph  ``funds, assets, or property'' include, but are not limited to,  commodities which have been processed into different end products as  provided for by this part, and the containers in which commodities have  been received from the Department.</p>
