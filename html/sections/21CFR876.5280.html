                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An implanted mechanical/hydraulic urinary  continence device is a device used to treat urinary incontinence by the  application of continuous or intermittent pressure to occlude the  urethra. The totally implanted device may consist of a static pressure  pad, or a system with a container of radiopaque fluid in the abdomen and  a manual pump and valve under the skin surface that is connected by  tubing to an adjustable pressure pad or to a cuff around the urethra.  The fluid is pumped as needed from the container to inflate the pad or  cuff to pass on the urethra.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required. A PMA or  a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food  and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 2000, for any  implanted mechanical/hydraulic urinary continence device that was in  commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before  December 26, 2000, been found to be substantially equivalent to an  implanted mechanical/hydraulic urinary continence device that was in  commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other implanted  mechanical/hydraulic urinary continence device shall have an approved  PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in  commercial distribution.
