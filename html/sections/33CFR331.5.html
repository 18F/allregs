                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for appeal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission of RFA. The appellant must  submit a completed RFA (as defined at Sec. 331.2) to the appropriate  division office in order to appeal an approved JD, a permit denial, or a  declined permit. An individual permit that has been signed by the  applicant, and subsequently unilaterally modified by the district  engineer pursuant to 33 CFR 325.7, may be appealed under this process,  provided that the applicant has not started work in waters of the United  States authorized by the permit. The RFA must be received by the  division engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for appeal. The reason(s) for requesting an appeal of an  approved JD, a permit denial, or a declined permit must be specifically  stated in the RFA and must be more than a simple request for appeal  because the affected party did not like the approved JD, permit  decision, or the permit conditions. Examples of reasons for appeals  include, but are not limited to, the following: A procedural error; an  incorrect application of law, regulation or officially promulgated  policy; omission of material fact; incorrect application of the current  regulatory criteria and associated guidance for identifying and  delineating wetlands; incorrect application of the Section 404(b)(1)  Guidelines (see 40 CFR part 230); or use of incorrect data. The reasons  for appealing a permit denial or a declined permit may include  jurisdiction issues, whether or not a previous approved JD was appealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions not appealable. An action or decision is not subject to  an administrative appeal under this part if it falls into one or more of  the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual permit decision (including a letter of permission  or a standard permit with special conditions), where the permit has been  accepted and signed by the permittee. By signing the permit, the  applicant waives all rights to appeal the terms and conditions of the  permit, unless the authorized work has not started in waters of the  United States and that   issued permit is subsequently modified by the district engineer pursuant  to 33 CFR 325.7;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any site-specific matter that has been the subject of a final  decision of the Federal courts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A final Corps decision that has resulted from additional  analysis and evaluation, as directed by a final appeal decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A permit denial without prejudice or a declined permit, where  the controlling factor cannot be changed by the Corps decision maker  (e.g., the requirements of a binding statute, regulation, state Section  401 water quality certification, state coastal zone management  disapproval, etc. (See 33 CFR 320.4(j));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A permit denial case where the applicant has subsequently  modified the proposed project, because this would constitute an amended  application that would require a new public interest review, rather than  an appeal of the existing record and decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any request for the appeal of an approved JD, a denied permit,  or a declined permit where the RFA has not been received by the division  engineer within 60 days of the date of the NAP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A previously approved JD that has been superceded by another  approved JD based on new information or data submitted by the applicant.  The new approved JD is an appealable action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An approved JD associated with an individual permit where the  permit has been accepted and signed by the permittee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A preliminary JD; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A JD associated with unauthorized activities except as provided  in Sec. 331.11.</p>
