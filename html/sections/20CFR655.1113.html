                                Sec. 655.1113  Element III--What does ``facility wage rate'' mean?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The third attestation element requires that the facility  employing or seeking to employ the alien must attest that ``the alien  employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered  nurses similarly employed by the facility.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The facility must pay the higher of the wage required in this  section (i.e.   facility wage), or the wage required in Sec. 655.1112 (i.e., prevailing  wage).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wage obligations for H-1C nurses in nonproductive status--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Circumstances where wages must be paid. If the H-1C nurse is not  performing work and is in a nonproductive status due to a decision by  the facility (e.g., because of lack of assigned work), because the nurse  has not yet received a license to work as a registered nurse, or any  other reason except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  the facility is required to pay the salaried H-1C nurse the full amount  of the weekly salary, or to pay the hourly-wage H-1C nurse for a full- time week (40 hours or such other number of hours as the facility can  demonstrate to be full-time employment) at the applicable wage rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Circumstances where wages need not be paid. If an H-1C nurse  experiences a period of nonproductive status due to conditions unrelated  to employment which take the nurse away from his/her duties at his/her  voluntary request and convenience (e.g., touring the U.S., caring for  ill relative) or render the nonimmigrant unable to work (e.g., maternity  leave, automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the  nonimmigrant), then the facility is not obligated to pay the required  wage rate during that period, provided that such period is not subject  to payment under the facility's benefit plan. Payment need not be made  if there has been a bona fide termination of the employment  relationship, as demonstrated by notification to USCIS that the  employment relationship has been terminated and the petition should be  canceled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation. The facility must maintain documentation  substantiating compliance with this attestation element. The public  access file shall contain the facility pay schedule for nurses or a  description of the factors taken into consideration by the facility in  making compensation decisions for nurses, if either of these documents  exists. Categories of nursing positions not covered by the public access  file documentation shall not be covered by the Attestation, and,  therefore, such positions shall not be filled or held by H-1C nurses.  The facility must maintain the payroll records, as required under the  Fair Labor Standards Act at 29 CFR part 516, and make such records  available to the Administrator in the event of an enforcement action  pursuant to subpart M of this part.</p>
