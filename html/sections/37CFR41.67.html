                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Appellant(s) may once, within time limits for filing set forth in Sec.  41.66, file a brief and serve the brief on all other parties to the proceeding in accordance with Sec.  1.903 of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appellant(s) may once, within time limits for filing set forth in Sec.  41.66, file a brief and serve the brief on all other parties to the proceeding in accordance with Sec.  1.903 of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The brief must be signed by the appellant, or the appellant's duly authorized attorney or agent and must be accompanied by the requisite fee set forth in Sec.  41.20(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An appellant's appeal shall stand dismissed upon failure of that appellant to file an appellant's brief, accompanied by the requisite fee, within the time allowed under Sec.  41.66(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The appellant's brief shall contain the following items under appropriate headings and in the order indicated in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(xi) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appellant's brief shall contain the following items under appropriate headings and in the order indicated in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(xi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Real party in interest. A statement identifying by name the real party in interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Related appeals, interferences, and trials. A statement identifying by application, patent, appeal, interference, or trial number all other prior and pending appeals, interferences, trials before the Board, or judicial proceedings known to appellant, the appellant's legal representative, or assignee which may be related to, directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the pending appeal. Copies of any decisions rendered by a court or the Board in any proceeding identified under this paragraph must be included in an appendix as required by paragraph (c)(1)(xi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Status of claims. A statement of the status of all the claims in the proceeding (e.g., rejected, allowed or confirmed, withdrawn, objected to, canceled). If the appellant is the owner, the appellant must also identify the rejected claims whose rejection is being appealed. If the appellant is a requester, the appellant must identify the claims that the examiner has made a determination favorable to patentability, which determination is being appealed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Status of amendments. A statement of the status of any amendment filed subsequent to the close of prosecution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Summary of claimed subject matter. A concise explanation of the subject matter defined in each of the independent claims involved in the appeal, which shall refer to the specification by column and line number, and to the drawing(s), if any, by reference characters. For each independent claim involved in the appeal and for each dependent claim argued separately under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section, every means plus function and step plus function as permitted by 35 U.S.C. 112(f), must be identified and the structure, material, or acts described in the specification as corresponding to each claimed function must be set forth with reference to the specification by page and line number, and to the drawing, if any, by reference characters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Issues to be reviewed on appeal. A concise statement of each issue presented for review. No new ground of rejection can be proposed by a third party requester appellant, unless such ground was withdrawn by the examiner during the prosecution of the proceeding, and the third party requester has not yet had an opportunity to propose it as a third party requester proposed ground of rejection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Argument. The contentions of appellant with respect to each issue presented for review in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section, and the basis therefor, with citations of the statutes, regulations, authorities, and parts of the record relied on. Any arguments or authorities not included in the brief permitted under this section or Sec. Sec.  41.68 and 41.71 will be refused consideration by the Board, unless good cause is shown. Each issue must be treated under a separate heading. If the appellant is the patent owner, for each ground of rejection in the Right of Appeal Notice which appellant contests and which applies to two or more claims, the claims may be argued separately or as a group. When multiple claims subject to the same ground of rejection are argued as a group by appellant, the Board may select a single claim from the group of claims that are argued together to decide the appeal with respect to the group of claims as to the ground of rejection on the basis of the selected claim alone. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the failure of appellant to separately argue claims which appellant has grouped together shall constitute a waiver of any argument that the Board must consider the patentability of any grouped claim separately. Any claim

argued separately should be placed under a subheading identifying the claim by number. Claims argued as a group should be placed under a subheading identifying the claims by number. A statement which merely points out what a claim recites will not be considered an argument for separate patentability of the claim.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Claims appendix. An appendix containing a copy of the claims to be reviewed on appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Evidence appendix. An appendix containing copies of any evidence submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec.  1.130, 1.131, or 1.132 of this title or of any other evidence entered by the examiner and relied upon by appellant in the appeal, along with a statement setting forth where in the record that evidence was entered in the record by the examiner. Reference to unentered evidence is not permitted in the brief. See Sec.  41.63 for treatment of evidence submitted after appeal. This appendix may also include copies of the evidence relied upon by the examiner in any ground of rejection to be reviewed on appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Related proceedings appendix. An appendix containing copies of decisions rendered by a court or the Board in any proceeding identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Certificate of service. A certification that a copy of the brief has been served in its entirety on all other parties to the reexamination proceeding. The names and addresses of the parties served must be indicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief shall not include any new or non-admitted amendment, or any new or non-admitted affidavit or other evidence. See Sec.  1.116 of this title for amendments, affidavits or other evidence filed after final action but before or on the same date of filing an appeal and Sec.  41.63 for amendments, affidavits or other evidence after the date of filing the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a brief is filed which does not comply with all the requirements of paragraph (a) and paragraph (c) of this section, appellant will be notified of the reasons for non-compliance and given a non-extendable time period within which to file an amended brief. If appellant does not file an amended brief within the set time period, or files an amended brief which does not overcome all the reasons for non-compliance stated in the notification, that appellant's appeal will stand dismissed.
