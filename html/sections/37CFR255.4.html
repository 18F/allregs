                                Sec.  255.4  Definition of digital phonorecord delivery.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A ``digital phonorecord delivery'' is each individual delivery of a  phonorecord by digital transmission of a sound recording which results  in a specifically identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission  recipient of a phonorecord of that sound recording, regardless of  whether the digital transmission is also a public performance of the  sound recording or any nondramatic musical work embodied therein. The  reproduction of the phonorecord must be sufficiently permanent or stable  to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for  a period of more than transitory duration. Such a phonorecord may be  permanent or it may be made available to the transmission recipient for  a limited period of time or for a specified   number of performances. A digital phonorecord delivery includes all  phonorecords that are made for the purpose of making the digital  phonorecord delivery.  [73 FR 66182, Nov. 7, 2008]</p>
