                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An eligible livestock producer will be eligible to receive payments for grazing losses for qualifying drought as specified in Sec. 1416.205(a), calculated as specified in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section. Total LFP payments to an eligible livestock producer in a calendar year for grazing losses due to qualifying drought will not exceed 5 monthly payments for the same livestock. Payments calculated in this section or elsewhere with respect to LFP are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part and are also subject to the payment limitations and average adjusted gross income provisions that are contained in subpart A of this part. Payment may only be made to the extent that eligibility is specifically provided for in this subpart. Hence, with respect to drought, payments will be made only as a ``1-month'' payment, a ``3-month'' payment, ``4-month'' payment, or a ``5-month'' payment based on the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To be eligible to receive a 1-month payment, that is a payment equal to the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (h) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a

D2 severe drought (intensity) in any area of the county for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland in the county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To be eligible to receive a 3-month payment, that is a payment equal to three times the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (h) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To be eligible to receive a 4-month payment, that is a payment equal to four times the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (h) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county for at least 4 weeks (not necessarily consecutive weeks) during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, or is rated as having a D4 (exceptional drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To be eligible to receive a 5-month payment, that is a payment equal to five times the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (h) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D4 (exceptional drought) in any area of the county for at least 4 weeks (not necessarily consecutive weeks) during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The monthly payment rate for LFP for grazing losses due to a qualifying drought, except as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, will be equal to 60 percent of the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The monthly feed cost for all covered livestock owned or leased by the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (h) of this section, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monthly feed cost calculated by using the normal carrying capacity of the eligible grazing land of the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An eligible livestock producer cannot receive more than a 5-month payment for the same covered livestock during the calendar year regardless of the number of drought intensity ratings the county receives; that is, the maximum payment an eligible livestock producer may receive under LFP in a calendar year cannot exceed 60 percent of 5 times the same covered livestock's monthly feed cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In the case of an eligible livestock producer that sold or otherwise disposed of covered livestock due to a qualifying drought in 1 or both of the 2 production years immediately preceding the current production year, the payment rate is 80 percent of the monthly payment rate calculated in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The monthly feed cost for covered livestock equals the product obtained by multiplying:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 30 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A payment quantity equal to the amount referred to in paragraph (h) of this section as the ``feed grain equivalent'', as determined under paragraph (h) of this section;
