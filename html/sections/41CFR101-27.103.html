Such adjustments should be tempered by caution and arrived at after careful consideration. Generally, acquisitions of items for inventory from excess sources shall not exceed a 2-year supply except when:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A greater quantity is needed to meet known requirements for an authorized planned program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The item is not available without special manufacture and a predictable requirement exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative determination has been made that in application of the EOQ principle of stock replenishment within an agency an inventory level in excess of 2 years is appropriate for low dollar-volume items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The items are being transferred into authorized stock funds for resale to other Government agencies.
