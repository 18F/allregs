with those individuals or entities believed responsible for the noncompliance. These efforts at informal resolution may include, without limitation, at the parties' expense, mediation, arbitration, or the use of a dispute resolution board, or other form of third party assistance. The FAA Airports District Office, FAA Airports Field Office, FAA Regional Airports Division responsible for administering financial assistance to the sponsor, or the FAA Office of Civil Rights will be available upon request to assist the parties with informal resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for complaints filed under 49 CFR 26.105(c), a complaint will be dismissed under Sec. 16.27 unless the person or authorized representative filing the complaint certifies that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complainant has made substantial and reasonable good faith efforts to resolve the disputed matter informally prior to filing the complaint; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is no reasonable prospect for practical and timely resolution of the dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The certification required under paragraph (b) of this section, shall include a brief description of the party's efforts to obtain informal resolution but shall not include information on monetary or other settlement offers made but not agreed upon in writing by all parties. Such efforts to resolve informally should be relatively recent and be demonstrated by pertinent documentation. There is no required form or process for informal resolution, but in each case the requirements to resolve the matter informally must meet the requirements of this paragraph.
