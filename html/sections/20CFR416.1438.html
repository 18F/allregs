The notice  will also contain an explanation of the procedures for requesting a  change in the time or place of your hearing, a reminder that if you fail  to appear at your scheduled hearing without good cause the  administrative law judge may dismiss your hearing request, and other  information about the scheduling and conduct of your hearing. You will  also be told if your appearance or that of any other party or witness is  scheduled to be made in person, by video teleconferencing, or by  telephone. If we have scheduled you to appear at the hearing by video  teleconferencing, the notice of hearing will tell you that the scheduled  place for the hearing is a video teleconferencing site and explain what  it means to appear at your hearing by video teleconferencing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acknowledging the notice of hearing.
