If an elastomer product that is subject to this subpart is produced within a process unit that is subject to subpart JJJ of this part, and at least 50 percent of the elastomer is used in the production of the product manufactured by the subpart JJJ process unit, the unit operations involved in the production of the elastomer are considered part of the process unit that is subject to subpart JJJ, and not this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce an elastomer product shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with this paragraph. The owner or operator shall initially determine whether a process unit is designated as an EPPU and subject to the provisions of this subpart in accordance with either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as an EPPU, but in which an elastomer product is produced, shall conduct an annual re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate the production of an elastomer product in a process unit that was not initially designated as an EPPU, and in which no elastomer products are currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise noted. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section contains reporting requirements associated with the applicability determinations. Paragraphs (f)(9) and (f)(10) describe criteria for removing the EPPU designation from a process unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial determination. The owner or operator shall initially determine if a process unit is subject to the provisions of this subpart based on the primary product of the process unit in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the process unit never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a process unit produces more than one intended product at the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the process unit, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is an elastomer product, then the elastomer product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 5, 1996 at existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units. If operations cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest operating time over the specified five year period for existing process units, or the specified one year period for new process units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified five year period for existing process units, or the specified one year period for new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If, according to paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the primary product of a process unit is an elastomer product, then that process unit shall be designated as an EPPU. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. If the primary product of a process unit is determined to be a product that is not an elastomer product, then that process unit is not an EPPU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the primary product cannot be determined for a flexible operation unit in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, but can determine that an elastomer product is not the primary product, then that flexible operation unit is not an EPPU.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, and cannot determine that an elastomer product is not the primary product as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU if an elastomer product was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating time of the flexible operation unit since March 9, 1999. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a flexible operation unit that is designated as an EPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the elastomer product produced for the greatest amount of time since March 9, 1999 shall be designated as the primary product of the EPPU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU if the owner or operator anticipates that an elastomer product will be manufactured in the flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the date the unit begins production of any

product. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a process unit that is designated as an EPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the elastomer product that will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the EPPU. If more than one elastomer product will be produced, the owner or operator may select which elastomer product is designated as the primary product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual applicability determination for non-EPPUs that have produced an elastomer product. Once per year beginning September 5, 2001, the owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated as an EPPU, but that has produced an elastomer product at any time in the preceding five-year period or since the date that the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section. However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce any elastomer product in the future, in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, is not required to perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time over which the product was produced during the preceding five-year period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the preceding five-year period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the primary product identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) is an elastomer product, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is an EPPU, and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the flexible operation unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applicability determination for non-EPPUs that have not produced an elastomer product. The owner or operator that anticipates the production of an elastomer product in a process unit that is not designated as an EPPU, and in which no elastomer products have been produced in the previous 5 year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Also, owners or operators who have notified the Administrator that a process unit is not an EPPU in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, that now anticipate the production of an elastomer product in the process unit, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall use the procedures in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section to determine if the process unit is designated as an EPPU, with the following exception: for existing process units that are determining the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, production shall be projected for the five years following the date that the owner or operator anticipates initiating the production of an elastomer product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the unit is designated as an EPPU in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance for flexible operation units. Owners or operators of EPPUs that are flexible operation units shall comply with the standards specified for the primary product, with the exceptions provided in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (f)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product in which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, the owner or operator is only required to comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate compliance for activities associated

with the manufacture of that product. This subpart does not require compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part for activities associated with the manufacture of a product that meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product that makes it subject to subpart GGG of this part, the owner or operator is not required to comply with the provisions of this subpart during the production of that product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Owners or operators of EPPUs that are flexible operation units have the option of determining the group status of each emission point associated with the flexible operation unit, in accordance with either paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, with the exception of batch front-end process vents. For batch front-end process vents, the owner or operator shall determine the group status in accordance with Sec. 63.488.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator may determine the group status of each emission point based on emission point characteristics when the primary product is being manufactured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator may determine the group status of each emission point separately for each product produced by the flexible operation unit. For each product, the group status shall be determined using the emission point characteristics when that product is being manufactured and using the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary product. (Note: Under this scenario, it is possible that the group status, and therefore the requirement to achieve emission reductions, for an emission point may change depending on the product being manufactured.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Owners or operators determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation units based solely on the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with either paragraph (f)(7)(i) or (f)(7)(ii) of this section. Owners or operators determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation units based on each product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish separate parameter monitoring levels in accordance with Sec. 63.505(a) for each individual product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with Sec. 63.505(a) that would apply for all products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Reporting requirements.

If it is determined that the process unit is not subject to this subpart, the owner or operator shall either retain all information, data, and analysis used to document the basis for the determination that the primary product is not an elastomer product, or, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the EPPU manufactures only one elastomer product, identification of that elastomer product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the EPPU is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(ii)(A) through (f)(8)(ii)(D) of this section, as appropriate, shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a primary product could be determined, identification of the primary product.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Identification of which compliance option, either paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, has been selected by the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the option to establish separate parameter monitoring levels for each product in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section is selected, the identification of each product and the corresponding parameter monitoring level.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If the option to establish a single parameter monitor level in paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section is selected, the parameter monitoring level for each parameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> EPPUs terminating production of all elastomer products. If an EPPU terminates the production of all elastomer products and does not anticipate the production of any elastomer products in the future, the process unit is no longer an EPPU and is not subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator.

The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The replacement of components meets the definition of reconstruction in Sec. 63.482(b); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such reconstruction commenced after June 12, 1995.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) and (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to Secs. 63.493 and 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in Sec. 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an addition or process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to Secs. 63.493 through 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in Sec. 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Existing affected source requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that become subject to subpart H requirements. If a process change or the addition of an emission point causes a surge control vessel or bottoms receiver to become subject to Sec. 63.170 under this paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Existing affected source requirements for compressors that become subject to subpart H requirements. If a process change or the addition of an emission point causes a compressor to become subject to Sec. 63.164 under this paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the compliance date for that compressor, as specified in Sec. 63.481(d), whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type or process catalyst type, or whenever the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment, or equipment changes that increase production capacity. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, process changes do not include: process upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as specified in Sec. 63.506(e)(7)(v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Applicability of this subpart. Paragraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section shall be followed during periods of non-operation of the affected source or any part thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during the period of non-operation. For example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the affected source would still be required to be controlled in accordance with the emission limitations in Sec. 63.484.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as referred to in Sec. 63.502, shall apply at all times, except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized, resulting in cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.502 applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in Sec. 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis

shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
