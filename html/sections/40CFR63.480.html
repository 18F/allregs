For purposes  of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include,  but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type or process catalyst  type, or whenever the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery  equipment, or equipment changes that increase production capacity. For  purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, process changes do not  include: process upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and  changes that do not alter the equipment configuration and operating  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or  add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that  change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in  paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as  specified in Sec. 63.506(e)(7)(v).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)(1)</em> through (4) of  this section shall be followed during periods of non-operation of the  affected source or any part thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the  emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all  times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or  specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to  which this subpart applies. However, if a period of non-operation of one  portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a  particular emission point to comply with the emission limitations to  which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to  comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during  the period of non-operation. For example, if there is an overpressure in  the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the affected source  would still be required to be controlled in accordance with the emission  limitations in Sec. 63.484.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as  referred to in Sec. 63.502, shall apply at all times, except during  periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion  thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized, resulting in  cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.502 applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment  that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during  times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or  residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown  would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items  of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in  this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to  a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are  caused by a malfunction, as defined in Sec. 63.2. Appropriate penalties  may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the  burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The  affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive  relief.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce  such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the  notification requirements of paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section, and  must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and  unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment,  or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have  been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better  operation and maintenance practices; did not stem from any activity or  event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and  were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design,  operation, or maintenance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the  applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and  overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these  repairs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions  (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable  during periods of such emissions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control  equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss  of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human  health;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in  operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air  pollution control practices;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were  documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent  with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause  analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate  the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting  from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis   shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering  judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the  malfunction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notification. The owner or operator of the facility  experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction  shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX)  transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days  after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail  itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that  malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative  defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within  45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in  this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting  documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph  (j)(4)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension  of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written  request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period.  Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator,  the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such  report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
