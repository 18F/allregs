                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the equipment and procedures for compression-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether engines meet the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this part. Measure the emissions of all the exhaust constituents subject to emissions standards as specified in 40 CFR part 1065. Measure CO2, N2O, and CH4 as described in Sec.  1039.235. Use the applicable duty cycles specified in Sec. Sec.  1039.505 and 1039.510.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1039.515 describes the supplemental procedures for evaluating

whether engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Measure smoke using the procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subpart I, for evaluating whether engines meet the smoke standards in Sec.  1039.105, except that you may test two-cylinder engines with an exhaust muffler like those installed on in-use engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use the fuels specified in Sec.  1039.104(e) and 40 CFR part 1065 to perform valid tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For diesel-fueled engines, use the appropriate diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065 for emission testing. Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel is the ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel. If we allow you to use a test fuel with higher sulfur levels, identify the test fuel in your application for certification and ensure that the emission control information label is consistent with your selection of the test fuel (see Sec.  1039.135(c)(9)). For example, do not test with ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel if you intend to label your engines to allow use of diesel fuel with sulfur concentrations up to 500 ppm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may use special or alternate procedures to the extent we allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we perform testing to determine if your engines meet emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You may disable any AECDs that have been approved solely for emergency equipment applications under Sec.  1039.115(g)(4). The emission standards do not apply when any of these AECDs are active.
