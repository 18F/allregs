Where they are present, the antenna system includes active elements, ground plane elements, matching networks, element-connecting hardware, mounting hardware, feed cable, and other functional or non-functional elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Antenna-mast system means the completed assembly of the antenna system and the mast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Base station means a transmitter and/or receiver in a fixed location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Citizens Band (CB) means the frequency band allocated for citizen's band radio service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Current means the total rate at which electrical charge is transported through the antenna-mast system in response to the applied test voltage, including both capacitive and resistive components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Electrical breakdown means a failure of the insulating material used with the antenna, such that in the Antenna-Mast System Test of Sec. 1204.4(e) of this subpart, the current flowing through the antenna-mast system is sufficient to actuate the automatic internal cut-off of the high voltage source or exceeds the current that can be measured by the current monitoring device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Feed cable means the electrical cable that connects the antenna system to the transmitter and/or receiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Field joint means any joint between antenna system sections or parts, or between the antenna system and the mast, that is not assembled by the antenna manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Insulating material and insulation mean a material that has a very small electric conductivity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Omnidirectional antenna means an antenna system designed or intended primarily to exhibit approximately equal signal transmission or reception capabilities in all horizontal directions simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Protection zone means that portion of an antenna system which can contact the test rod during the Insulating Material Effectiveness Test or can contact the power line during the Antenna-Mast System Test. This zone consists of those elements of the antenna system extending from the uppermost tip of an upright antenna downward to a point that is 12.0 inches (30.5 cm) above the top of the mast when the antenna system is mounted according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Voltage, phase to ground, means that voltage which exists between a single phase of a three phase power system and ground.</p>
