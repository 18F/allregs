                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the  compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be  subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid  individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors  subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies,  programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money  authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees.  However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation  threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall  specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for  compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a  total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE   cost-type contracts. For purposes of designating the threshold, total  compensation includes only the employee's salary and cash bonus or  incentive compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reimbursable costs for compensation for personal services are  to be set forth in the contract. This compensation shall be set forth  using the principles and policies of 48 CFR 31.205-6, Compensation, as  supplemented by this section, 970.3102-05-6, and other pertinent parts  of the DEAR. Costs that are unallowable under other contract terms shall  not be allowable as compensation for personnel services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract sets forth, in detail, personnel costs and related  expenses allowable under the contract and documents personnel policies,  practices and plans which have been found acceptable by the contracting  officer. The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any  matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to  personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed  in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and  incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other  premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs;  paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as  union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances,  or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided,  however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each  instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual  rate as specified in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding the costs cited in this subsection, incurred  for compensation of a senior executive in excess of the benchmark  compensation amount determined applicable for the contractor fiscal year  by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, are  unallowable. Allowable costs of executive compensation shall be  determined pursuant to 48 CFR 31.205-6(p).  [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 68219, Nov. 5, 2010]</p>
