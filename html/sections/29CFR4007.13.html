                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies where there  is a ``DRA 2005 termination'' of a plan. Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, there is a DRA 2005 termination where a single-employer  plan's termination date is after 2005 and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan terminates under section 4042 of ERISA, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or  (iii) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plans terminated during reorganization proceedings. Except as  provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a DRA 2005 termination of  a plan does not occur where as of the plan's termination date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A bankruptcy proceeding has been filed by or against any person  that was a contributing sponsor of the plan on the day before the plan's  termination date or that was on that day a member of any controlled  group of which any such contributing sponsor was a member,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proceeding is pending as a reorganization proceeding under  chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code (or under any similar law of  a State or political subdivision of a State),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person has not been discharged from the proceeding, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The proceeding was filed before October 18, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain airline-related plans. Paragraph (a)(2)  of this section does not apply to an ``eligible plan'' under section  402(c)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (dealing with certain  plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline catering services)  while an election under section 402(a)(1) of the Pension Protection Act  of 2006 (dealing with alternative funding schedules) is in effect for  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Termination premium. A premium as described in Sec. 4006.7 of  this chapter is payable to PBGC with respect to a DRA 2005 termination  each year for three years after the termination (the ``termination  premium'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing requirements; method of filing. Notwithstanding  Sec. 4007.3, in the case of a DRA 2005 termination of a plan, each  person that was a contributing sponsor of the plan on the day before the  plan's termination date or that was on that day a member of any  controlled group of which any such contributing sponsor was a member is  responsible for filing prescribed termination premium information and  payments. Any such person may file on behalf of all such persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>, (d), or (e). The charge will not exceed the  amount of termination premium not timely filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Due dates. Notwithstanding Sec. 4007.11, the due date for the  termination premium is the 30th day of each of three applicable 12-month  periods. The three applicable 12-month periods   with respect to a DRA 2005 termination of a plan are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First applicable 12-month period. Except as provided in  paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, the period of 12 calendar months  beginning with the first calendar month following the calendar month in  which occurs the plan's termination date, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent applicable 12-month periods. Each of the first two  periods of 12 calendar months that immediately follow the first  applicable 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certain reorganization cases. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (e) applies  with respect to a DRA 2005 termination of a plan if the conditions in  both paragraph (e)(2) and paragraph (e)(3) of this section are  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan terminates under section 4042 of ERISA, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> is that as of the plan's  termination date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A bankruptcy proceeding has been filed by or against any person  that was a contributing sponsor of the plan on the day before the plan's  termination date or that was on that day a member of any controlled  group of which any such contributing sponsor was a member,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proceeding is pending as a reorganization proceeding under  chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code (or under any similar law of  a State or political subdivision of a State), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person has not been discharged from the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If this paragraph (e) applies with respect to a DRA 2005  termination of a plan, then except as provided in paragraph (f) of this  section, the first applicable 12-month period with respect to the plan  is the period of 12 calendar months beginning with the first calendar  month following the calendar month in which occurs the earliest date  when, for every person that was a contributing sponsor of the plan on  the day before the plan's termination date, or that was on that day a  member of any controlled group of which any such contributing sponsor  was a member, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There is not pending any bankruptcy proceeding that was filed by  or against such person and that was, as of the plan's termination date,  a reorganization proceeding under chapter 11 of title 11, United States  Code (or under any similar law of a State or political subdivision of a  State), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person has been discharged in any such proceeding, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Plan termination date in past when set. If a plan's termination  date is in the past when it is established by agreement or court action  as described in section 4048 of ERISA, then the first applicable 12- month period for determining the due dates of the termination premium  begins with the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The first calendar month following the calendar month in which  the termination date is established by agreement or court action as  described in section 4048 of ERISA, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The first calendar month specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section or (if paragraph (e) of this section applies) paragraph (e)(4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Liability for termination premiums. In the case of a DRA 2005  termination of a plan, each person that was a contributing sponsor of  the plan on the day before the plan's termination date, or that was on  that day a member of any controlled group of which any such contributing  sponsor was a member, is jointly and severally liable for termination  premiums with respect to the plan.

However,  this is only general policy guidance. Our action in each case is guided  by the facts and circumstances of the case. 2 What defined terms are used in this Appendix?</p><p class="depth0">The following terms are defined in part 4001 of this chapter:  contributing sponsor, ERISA, PBGC, person, plan, and plan administrator.  In addition, in this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Premium penalty means a penalty under ERISA section 4007 and  under this part for failing to pay a premium in full and on time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Waiver means reduction or elimination of a premium penalty that  is being or has been assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> We means PBGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> You means, according to the context,--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A plan administrator, contributing sponsor, or other person,  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person's action or inaction may be the basis for a premium  penalty assessment,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person may be required to pay the premium penalty, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person is requesting review of the premium penalty; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An employee or agent of, or advisor to, any of these persons. 3 What is the purpose of a premium penalty?</p><p class="depth0">The basic purpose of a premium penalty is to encourage you to pay  premiums in full and on time and to voluntarily self-correct any failure  to do so. 4 What information is in this Appendix and how is it organized?</p><p class="depth0">This Appendix has four divisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. The General Provisions division (Secs. 1-4)  tells you the purpose and organization of the Appendix, the purpose of a  premium penalty, and the definitions of terms used in the Appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Premium penalty assessment. The Premium Penalty Assessment  division is reserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waiver standards. The Waiver Standards division (Secs. 21-25)  explains the principles that PBGC follows in waiving premium penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable cause. We waive premium penalties for reasonable  cause, as explained in Secs. 22-25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other waivers. We also waive premium penalties in some other  circumstances, such as mistake of law, as explained in Sec. 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures. The Procedures division is reserved.</p><p class="depth0">Premium Penalty Assessment</p><p class="depth0">[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Waiver Standards  21 What are the standards for waiving a premium penalty?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Facts and circumstances. In deciding whether to waive a premium  penalty in whole or in part under paragraph (b), we consider the facts  and circumstances of each case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Waivers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provisions of law. We waive all or part of a premium penalty if  a statute or regulation requires that we do so. For example, ERISA  section 4007(b) and Sec. 4007.8 of this part provide for a waiver in  certain circumstances involving business hardship, and Sec. 4007.8 of  this part also provides , and for a waiver of a premium penalty that  accrues after the date of a bill for a premium underpayment if you pay  the premium owed within 30 days after the date of the bill, and for  waivers in certain cases where you pay not more than a week late or  where you estimate the variable-rate premium and then timely correct any  underpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable cause. We waive a premium penalty if you show  reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium in full and on time. See  Secs. 22 through 25 for guidelines on ``reasonable cause'' waivers. If  there is reasonable cause for only part of a failure to pay a premium,  we waive the premium penalty only for that part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Legal errors. We may waive all or part of a premium penalty if  the failure to pay a premium in full and on time that gives rise to the  premium penalty results from certain kinds of legal errors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Erroneous legal interpretation--disclosed. If a failure to pay a  premium in full and on time results from your reliance on an erroneous  interpretation of the law, we waive a premium penalty that arises from  the failure if you promptly and adequately call our attention to the  interpretation and the relevant facts, and the erroneous interpretation  is not frivolous. If the interpretation affects   a filing that you make with us, you should call our attention to the  interpretation in writing with the filing. If you rely on the  interpretation to justify not making a filing with us, you should call  our attention to the interpretation in writing by the time prescribed  for the filing not made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Erroneous legal interpretation--undisclosed. If a failure to  pay a premium in full and on time results from your reliance on an  erroneous interpretation of the law, and you do not promptly and  adequately call our attention to the interpretation and the relevant  facts, we may nevertheless waive a premium penalty if the weight of  authority supporting the interpretation is substantial in relation to  the weight of opposing authority and it is reasonable for you to rely on  the interpretation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Recent change in the law. We may waive all or part of a  premium penalty if the law changes shortly before the date a premium  payment is due and the premium payment that you make by the due date  would have been correct under the law as in effect before the change. In  determining whether and to what extent to grant a waiver in a case of  this kind, we consider such factors as the length of time between the  change in the law and the premium due date, the nature and timing of any  publicity given to the change in the law, the complexity of the legal  issues, and your general familiarity with those issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pendency of PBGC procedures. We may waive all or a part of a  premium penalty that is attributable to the pendency of PBGC review or  other procedures. For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If you request review of a premium penalty, and you make a non- frivolous argument in your request for review that you were not required  to pay the premium or that you were, and still are, unable to obtain the  information needed to determine the premium, we may waive the portion of  the premium penalty that accrues during the review process. If you make  such a non-frivolous argument with respect to a portion of the premium,  we may apply this principle to that portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We may waive all or a part of a premium penalty if we believe  that the pendency of PBGC procedures for identifying a premium  delinquency and notifying you of the delinquency contributed to your  failure to correct the delinquency more promptly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other circumstances. We may waive all or part of a premium  penalty in other circumstances if we determine that it is appropriate to  do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Action or inaction of outside parties. In some cases an  accountant, actuary, lawyer, pension consultant, or other individual or  firm that is not part of your organization may assist you in complying  with PBGC requirements. If the outside individual's or firm's action,  inaction, or advice causes or contributes to a failure to pay a premium  in full and on time, we apply our waiver authority as if the outside  individual or firm were part of your organization. In the case of an  outside individual who is part of a firm, we generally consider both the  individual and the firm to be part of your organization. 22 What is ``reasonable cause''?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In general, there is ``reasonable cause'' for a  failure to pay a premium in full and on time to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The failure arises from circumstances beyond your control, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You could not avoid the failure by the exercise of ordinary  business care and prudence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overlooking legal requirements. Overlooking legal requirements  does not constitute reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Action or inaction of outside parties. If an accountant,  actuary, lawyer, pension consultant, or other individual or firm that is  not part of your organization assists you in complying with PBGC  requirements, there is generally no reasonable cause for a failure to  pay a premium in full and on time that arises from circumstances within  the control of the outside individual or firm, or could be avoided by  the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence by the outside  individual or firm. The fact that you exercised care and prudence in  selecting and monitoring the outside individual or firm is not a basis  for a reasonable cause waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Size of organization. If an organization or one or more of its  employees is responsible for taking action, the size of the organization  may affect what ordinary business care and prudence would require. For  example, ordinary business care and prudence would typically require a  larger organization to establish more comprehensive backup procedures  than a smaller organization for dealing with situations such as computer  failure, the loss of important records, and the inability of an  individual to carry out assigned responsibilities. Thus, there may be  reasonable cause for a small organization's failure to pay a premium in  full and on time even though, if the organization were larger, the  exercise of ordinary business care and prudence would have avoided the  failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Size of premium underpayment. In general, the larger a premium,  the more care and prudence you should use to make sure that you pay it  in full and on time. Thus, there may be reasonable cause for a small  underpayment even though, under the same circumstances, we would  conclude that a larger underpayment could have been avoided by the  exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Collection and enforcement. In determining whether reasonable  cause exists, we do not consider either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The likelihood or cost of collecting the premium penalty, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The costs and risks of enforcing the premium penalty by  litigation. 23 What kinds of facts does PBGC consider in determining whether there</p><p class="depth0">is reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium?</p><p class="depth0">In determining the extent to which a failure to pay a premium in  full and on time arose from circumstances beyond your control and the  extent to which you could have avoided the failure by the exercise of  ordinary business care and prudence--and thus the extent to which waiver  of a premium penalty for reasonable cause is appropriate--we consider  facts such as the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What event or circumstance caused the underpayment and when the  event happened or the circumstance arose. The dates you give should  clearly correspond with the underpayment upon which the premium penalty  is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How that event or circumstance kept you from paying the premium  in full and on time. The explanation you give should relate directly to  the failure to pay a premium that is the subject of the premium penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Whether you could have anticipated the event or circumstance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How you responded to the event or circumstance, including what  steps you took, and how quickly you took them, to pay the premium and  how you conducted other business affairs. Knowing how you responded to  the event or circumstance may help us determine what degree of business  care and prudence you were capable of exercising during that period and  thus whether the failure to pay the premium could or could not have been  avoided by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence. 24 What are some situations that might justify a ``reasonable cause''</p><p class="depth0">waiver?</p><p class="depth0">The following examples illustrate some of the reasons often given  for failures to pay premiums for which we may assess penalties. The  situation described in each example may constitute reasonable cause, and  each example lists factors we consider in determining whether to grant a  premium penalty waiver for reasonable cause in a case of that kind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An individual with responsibility for taking action was suddenly  and unexpectedly absent or unable to act. We consider such factors as  the following: The nature of the event that caused the individual's  absence or inability to act, for example, the resignation of the  individual or the death or serious illness of the individual or a member  of the individual's immediate family; the size of the organization and  what kind of backup procedures it had to cope with such events; how  close the event was to the deadline that was missed; how abrupt and  unanticipated the event was; how the individual's absence or inability  to act prevented compliance; how expensive it would have been to comply  without the absent individual; whether and how other business operations  and obligations were affected; how quickly and prudently a replacement  for the absent individual was selected or other arrangements for  compliance were made; and how quickly a replacement for the absent  individual took appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A fire or other casualty or natural disaster destroyed relevant  records or prevented compliance in some other way. We consider such  factors as the following: The nature of the event; how close the event  was to the deadline that was missed; how the event caused the failure to  pay the premium; whether other efforts were made to get needed  information; how expensive it would have been to comply; and how you  responded to the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You reasonably relied on erroneous oral or written advice given  by a PBGC employee. We consider such factors as the following: Whether  there was a clear relationship between your situation and the advice  sought; whether you provided the PBGC employee with adequate and  accurate information; and whether the surrounding circumstances should  have led you to question the correctness of the advice or information  provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> You were unable to obtain information, including records and  calculations, needed to comply. We consider such factors as the  following: What information was needed; why the information was  unavailable; when and how you discovered that the information was not  available; what attempts you made to get the information or reconstruct  it through other means; and how much it would have cost to comply. 25 What are some situations that might justify a partial ``reasonable</p><p class="depth0">cause'' waiver?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume that a fire destroyed the records needed to compute a  premium payment. If in the exercise of ordinary business care and  prudence it should take you one month to reconstruct the records and pay  the premium, but the payment was made two months late, it might be  appropriate to waive that part of the premium penalty attributable to  the first month the payment was late, but not the part attributable to  the second month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume that a plan administrator underpaid the plan's flat-rate  premium because of reasonable reliance on erroneous advice from a PBGC  employee, and also underpaid the plan's variable-rate premium because  the plan actuary used the wrong interest rate. A PBGC audit revealed  both errors. PBGC billed the plan for a premium penalty of $5,000-- $1,000 for underpayment of the flat-rate premium and $4,000 for  underpayment of the variable-rate premium. The plan administrator  requested a waiver of the premium penalty. While the erroneous PBGC  advice constituted reasonable cause for underpaying the flat-rate  premium, there was no   showing of reasonable cause for the error in the variable-rate premium.  Therefore, we would waive only the part of the premium penalty based on  underpayment of the flat-rate portion of the premium ($1,000).</p><p class="depth0">Procedures</p><p class="depth0">[Reserved]  [71 FR 66869, Nov. 17, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 13562, Mar. 11, 2014]</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER C_CERTAIN REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS</p>
