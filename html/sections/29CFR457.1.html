                            <p class="depth0">The regulations contained in this subchapter are designed to implement 5 U.S.C. 7120 and 22 U.S.C. 4117, which relate to the standards of conduct for labor organizations in the Federal sector set forth in title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and chapter 10 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. They prescribe procedures and basic principles which the Director of Labor will utilize in effectuating the standards of conduct required of labor organizations composed of Federal government employees that are covered by these Acts. (Regulations implementing the other provisions of title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act are issued by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations implementing the other provisions of chapter 10 of the Foreign Service Act are issued by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Foreign Service Impasse Disputes Panel in title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations.) \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Pursuant to section 220(a)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1351(a)(1), labor organizations covered by that statute are subject to the standards of conduct provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 7120, and are therefore subject to the regulations in this subchapter. Regulations implementing the Congressional Accountability Act were issued at 142 Cong. R. S12062 (daily ed., October 1, 1996) and 142 Cong. R. H10369 (Daily ed., September 12, 1996).
