                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to 5  U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2),  (e)(3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g); in addition, the  following systems of records are exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a  (k)(1) and (k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and  (H):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Civil Division Case File System, JUSTICE/CIV-001.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Only that information which relates to the investigation,  prosecution, or defense of actual or potential criminal or civil  litigation, or which has been properly classified in the interest of  national defense and foreign policy is exempted for the reasons set  forth from the following subsections:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject of a criminal or civil  matter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of  records concerning him or her would inform that individual (and others  to whom the subject might disclose the records) of the existence,  nature, or scope of that investigation and thereby seriously impede law  enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and others to avoid  criminal penalties and civil remedies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsections (c)(4), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g). These  provisions are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records  are exempted from subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (d). To the extent that information contained in  these systems has been properly classified, relates to the investigation  and/or prosecution of grand jury, civil fraud, and other law enforcement  matters, disclosure could compromise matters which should be kept secret  in the interest of national security or foreign policy; compromise  confidential investigations or proceedings; hamper sensitive civil or  criminal investigations; impede affirmative enforcement actions based  upon alleged violations of regulations or of civil or criminal laws;  reveal the identity of confidential sources; and result in unwarranted  invasions of the privacy of others. Amendment of the records would  interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose  an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations  to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsection (e)(1). In the course of criminal or civil  investigations, cases, or matters, the Civil Division may obtain  information concerning the actual or potential violation of laws which  are not strictly within its statutory authority. In the interest of  effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information  since it may establish patterns of criminal activity or avoidance of  other civil obligations and provide leads for Federal and other law  enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject of a  criminal investigation or prosecution would present a serious impediment  to law enforcement in that the subject (and others to whom the subject  might be in contact) would be informed of the existence of the  investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or  apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or  to fabricate testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subsection (e)(3). To comply with this requirement during the  course of a criminal investigation or prosecution could jeopardize the  investigation by   disclosing the existence of a confidential investigation, revealing the  identity of witnesses or confidential informants, or impeding the  information gathering process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Subsection (e)(5). In compiling information for criminal law  enforcement purposes, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness and  relevancy of the information obtained cannot always be immediately  determined. As new details of an investigation come to light, seemingly  irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance and the  accuracy of such information can often only be determined in a court of  law. Compliance with this requirement would therefore restrict the  ability of government attorneys in exercising their judgment in  developing information necessary for effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em>. To serve notice would give persons sufficient  warning to evade law enforcement efforts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em>, (d), and (e)(1).  Consumer Inquiry/Investigatory System, JUSTICE/CIV-006.   These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this  system of records is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a  (j)(2) and (k)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Only that information compiled for criminal or civil law  enforcement purposes is exempted for the reasons set forth from the  following subsections:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsections (c)(3). This system occasionally contains  investigatory material based on complaints of actual or alleged criminal  or civil violations. To provide the subject of a criminal or civil  matter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of  records concerning him/her would inform that individual of the  existence, nature, or scope of that investigation, and thereby seriously  impede law enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and  other persons to whom he might disclose the records to avoid criminal  penalties and civil remedies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsections (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the  extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (d). Disclosure of information relating to the  investigation of complaints of alleged violation of criminal or civil  law could interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of  confidential sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the  privacy of others. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing  criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible  administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be  continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsection (e)(1). In the course of criminal or civil  investigations, cases, or matters, the Civil Division may obtain  information concerning the actual or potential violation of laws which  are not strictly within its statutory authority. In the interest of  effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information  since it may establish patterns of criminal activity or avoidance of  other civil obligations and provide leads for Federal and other law  enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>.

This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this  system is   subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C 552a (j)(2) and (k)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Only that portion of the Congressional and Citizen  Correspondence File maintained by the Communications Office which  consists of criminal or civil investigatory information is exempted for  the reasons set forth from the following subsection:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsection (d). Disclosure of investigatory information would  jeopardize the integrity of the investigative process, disclose the  identity of individuals who furnished information to the government  under an express or implied promise that their identities would be held  in confidence, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of  others. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal  law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative  burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously  reinvestigated.
