                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. Each state with an existing or anticipated rail fixed guideway system regulated by this part shall designate an oversight agency consistent with the provisions of this section. For a rail fixed guideway system that will operate in only one state, the state must designate an agency of the state, other than the rail transit agency, as the oversight agency to implement the requirements in this part. The state's designation or re-designation of its oversight agency and submission of required information as specified in this section, are subject to review by FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. States which have designated oversight agencies for purposes of this part before May 31, 2005 are not required to re-designate to FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing. The state designation of the oversight agency shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coincide with the execution of any grant agreement for a New Starts project between FTA and a rail transit agency within the state's jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Occur before the application by a rail transit agency for funding under FTA's formula program for urbanized areas (49 U.S.C. 5336).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification to FTA. Within (60) days of designation of the oversight agency, the state must submit to FTA the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the oversight agency designated to implement requirements in this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation of the oversight agency's authority to provide state oversight;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contact information for the representative identified by the designated oversight agency with responsibility for oversight activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the organizational and financial relationship between the designated oversight agency and the rail transit agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A schedule for the designated agency's development of its State Safety Oversight Program, including the projected date of its initial submission, as required in Sec. 659.39(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple states. In cases of a rail fixed guideway system that will operate in more than one state, each affected state must designate an agency of the state, other than the rail transit agency, as the oversight agency to implement the requirements in this part. To fulfill this requirement, the affected states:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May agree to designate one agency of one state, or an agency representative of all states, to implement the requirements in this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event multiple states share oversight responsibility for a rail fixed guideway system, the states must ensure that the rail fixed guideway system is subject to a single program standard, adopted by all affected states.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Change of designation. Should a state change its designated oversight agency, it shall submit the information required under paragraph (d) of this section to FTA within (30) days of its change. In addition, the new oversight agency must submit a new initial submission, consistent with Sec. 659.39(b), within (30) days of its designation.</p>
