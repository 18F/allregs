                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The drainage area required on a vessel must be computed using the following formula:
For protected waters required drainage = .1 x Basic Drainage
For partially protected waters required drainage = .5 x Basis Drainage
For exposed waters required drainage = Basic Drainage

where:
Basic Drainage area in centimeters\2\ = 4389.12 x [(Recess Volume x Recess Ratio) + (Weather Deck Volume x Weather Deck Ratio)]; or
Basic Drainage area in inch\2\ = (Recess Volume x Recess Ratio) + (Weather Deck Volume x Weather Deck Ratio)
Recess Volume = (BR x DR) - VR
BR = average height in centimeters (feet) of the bulwark</p><p class="depth2">above the well deck or cockpit deck;DR = total deck area of the cockpit or well deck in the after</p><p class="depth2">\2/3\ of the vessel length (LOD) measured in centimeters\2\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(feet\2\)</em>.VR = volume of any weather tight structure below the bulwark</p><p class="depth2">of the well deck or cockpit deck.
Recess Ratio = LR / LC
LR = the length of the recess in the after \2/3\ vessel</p><p class="depth2">length (LOD).LC=\2/3\ vessel length (LOD).
Weather Deck Volume = (BD x DD) - VS
BD = average height in centimeters (feet) of the bulwark</p><p class="depth2">above the weather deck;DD = total deck area of the weather deck adjacent to bulwarks</p><p class="depth2">but not in way of the cockpit or well deck in the after \2/3\</p><p class="depth2">of the vessel length (LOD) measured in centimenters\2\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(feet\2\)</em>.VS = volume of any weather tight superstructure below the</p><p class="depth2">bulwark on the weather deck located within DD.
Weather Deck Ratio = LD / LC
LD = the length of the weather deck bulwark in the after \2/</p><p class="depth2">3\ of the vessel length (LOD).LC=\2/3\ vessel length (LOD).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vessels with bulwarks in the forward part of the vessel shall not form a well with the deckhouse which retains water.
