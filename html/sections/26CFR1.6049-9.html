                                Sec. 1.6049-9  Premium subject to reporting for a debt instrument
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Notwithstanding Sec. 1.6049-5(f), for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014, if a broker (as defined in Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(1)) is required to file a statement for the debt instrument under Sec. 1.6049-6, the broker generally must report any bond premium (as defined in Sec. 1.171-1(d)) or acquisition premium (as defined in Sec. 1.1272-2(b)(3)) for the calendar year. This section, however, only applies to a debt instrument that is a covered security as defined in Sec. 1.6045-1(a)(15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reporting of bond premium amortization. Unless a broker has been notified in writing in accordance with Sec. 1.6045-1(n)(5) that a customer does not want to amortize bond premium under section 171, the broker must report the amount of any amortizable bond premium allocable to a stated interest payment made to the customer during the calendar year. See Sec. Sec. 1.171-2 and

1.171-3 to determine the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable to a stated interest payment. Instead of reporting a gross amount for both stated interest and amortizable bond premium, a broker may report a net amount of stated interest that reflects the offset of the stated interest payment by the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable to the payment. In this case, the broker must not report the amortizable bond premium as a separate item. This paragraph (b) also applies to amortizable bond premium on a tax-exempt obligation, which is required to be amortized under section 171.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting of acquisition premium amortization. A broker must report the amount of any acquisition premium amortization that reduces the amount of original issue discount includible in income by the customer during a calendar year. For a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2015, a broker must use the rules in Sec. 1.1272-2(b)(4) to determine the amount of acquisition premium amortization. However, for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, if a customer timely notifies the broker in accordance with Sec. 1.6045-1(n)(5), a broker may use the rules in Sec. 1.1272-3 to determine the amount of acquisition premium amortization. Instead of reporting a gross amount for both original issue discount and acquisition premium amortization, a broker may report a net amount of original issue discount that reflects the offset of the original issue discount includible in income by the customer for the calendar year by the amount of acquisition premium allocable to the original issue discount. In this case, the broker must not report the acquisition premium amortization as a separate item. See Sec. 1.6049-10T for the reporting of acquisition premium on a tax-exempt obligation.

Sec. 1.6049-10T  Reporting of original issue discount on a tax-exemptobligation (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6049, a payor (as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(a)(2)) of original issue discount (OID) on a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1288(b)(2)) is required to report the daily portions of OID on the obligation as if the daily portions of OID that accrued during a calendar year were paid to the holder (or holders) of the obligation in the calendar year. The amount of the daily portions of OID that accrues during a calendar year is determined as if section 1272 and Sec. 1.1272-1 applied to a tax-exempt obligation. Notwithstanding any other rule in section 6049 and the regulations thereunder, a payor must determine whether a tax-exempt obligation was issued with OID and the amount of OID that accrues for each relevant period. As prescribed by section 1288(b)(1), OID on a tax-exempt obligation is determined without regard to the de minimis rules in section 1273(a)(3) and Sec. 1.1273-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition premium. A payor is required to report acquisition premium amortization on a tax-exempt obligation in accordance with the rules in Sec. 1.6049-9(c) as if section 1272 applied to a tax-exempt obligation. See paragraph (a) of this section to determine the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to a tax-exempt obligation acquired on or after January 1, 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Expiration date.

Every person who administers a Federal, State, or local program a principal purpose of which is to provide subsidized energy financing (as defined in section 23(c)(10)(C) and the regulations thereunder) or grants for projects designed

Sec. 1.6050E-1  Reporting of State and local income tax refunds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Section 6050E and this section apply to any refund officer who, with respect to an individual, makes payments of refunds of State or local income taxes or allows credits or offsets with respect to such taxes aggregating $10 or more for such individual in any calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term refund officer means the officer or employee of a State or local taxing jurisdiction having control of payments of refunds or the allowance of credits or offsets, or the person approporiately designated for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term State shall include the District of Columbia but shall not include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any possession of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term individual shall not include an estate or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term credit or offset means an overpayment of tax which, in lieu of being refunded to the taxpayer, is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applied against an existing liability of the taxpayer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Available for application against a future liability of the taxpayer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise used or available for use for the taxpayer's benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirement of reporting. Every refund officer described in paragraph (a) of this section shall make an information return in accordance with this section for each calendar year. An information return must be made even if the refund officer is not required to furnish a statement to the applicable taxpayer under paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prescribed Form. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the information return required by paragraph (c) of this section shall be made on Forms 1096 and 1099.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Refunds involving different taxable years. In the case of refunds paid or credits or offsets allowed during a calendar year with respect to two or more taxable years of an individual, a separate Form 1099 shall be filed with respect to each taxable year of the individual. Thus, if during calendar year 1983 a refund officer pays to an individual a refund of $15 with respect to that individual's taxable year ending in 1982 and $20 with respect to that individual's taxable year ending in 1981, a separate Form 1099 shall be filed for each of the two payments. If, instead, the refund with respect to the individual's taxable year ending in 1982 were $5 instead of $15, no return would be required for the payment of $5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Information required. The information required to be reported on Forms 1096 and 1099 includes the aggregate amount of refunds, credits, and offsets made or allowed during the calendar year with respect to the taxable year of the individual covered by the return; the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the individual with respect to whom such payment, credit, or offset was made or allowed; the taxable year covered by the return; and such other information as may be required by the forms. In addition, the nature of the tax is required to be indicated on the Form 1099 in any case where the refund, credit or offset is made or allowed with respect to a payment attributable to an income tax that applies exclusively to income from a trade or business and is not a tax of general application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> When credit or offset deemed allowed. For purposes of a return of information under this section, a credit or offset is deemed to be allowed when the liability to pay or credit such amount is admitted by the State or local taxing jurisdiction. Thus, if an amount with respect to a taxpayer's 1982 taxable year is credited in 1983 to reduce the liability of the taxpayer to make estimated tax payments in 1983, it is reportable as a credit allowed in 1983. It is not reportable in the taxable year that gives rise to the refund, credit or offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Time and place for filing. The returns required under this section for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of that calendar year, but not before the refund officer's final payment (or allowance of credit or offset) for the year, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year. Returns shall be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Forms 1099. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see Sec. 1.6081-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of magnetic media and substitute forms--(1) Magnetic media.

See section 6011(e) and applicable regulations and revenue procedures thereunder. If a refund officer is not required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media, the refund officer may request permission under applicable regulations and revenue procedures to submit the information required by this section on magnetic media.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Magnetic media. A refund officer may be required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media or machine-readable paper forms. See section 6011(e) and applicable regulations and revenue procedures thereunder. If a refund officer is not required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media, the refund officer may request permission under applicable regulations and revenue procedures to submit the information required by this section on magnetic media.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substitute forms. A refund officer may prepare and use a form which contains provisions identical with those of Form 1096 if the refund officer complies with all revenue procedures relating to substitute Form 1096 in effect at that time. In addition, if a refund officer is not required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media or machine-readable paper forms, the refund officer may prepare and use a form which contains provisions identical with those of Form 1099 if the refund officer complies with all revenue procedures relating to substitute Form 1099 in effect at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Voluntary information exchange agreements. The requirements of reporting information to the Internal Revenue Service under this section may be satisfied for any calendar year by submission of the information required under paragraph (f) of this section in accordance with the terms of a voluntary information exchange agreement between the State and the United States in effect during such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Requirement of furnishing statements to recipients--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of

this section, every refund officer required to make a return of information under this section shall furnish to the individual whose identifying number is required to be shown on the return a written statement showing the aggregate amount shown on the information return of refunds, credits and offsets made or allowed to such individual with respect to each taxable year of the individual, the name of the State or local taxing jurisdiction paying such refund or allowing such credits or offsets, the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit or offset and a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The requirement of this paragraph may be met by furnishing to the individual a copy of the Form 1099 filed with respect to that individual provided that the form bears a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement shall be considered to be furnished to an individual if it is mailed to the individual at the individual's last known address. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the individual in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see Sec. 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of

this section, every refund officer required to make a return of information under this section shall furnish to the individual whose identifying number is required to be shown on the return a written statement showing the aggregate amount shown on the information return of refunds, credits and offsets made or allowed to such individual with respect to each taxable year of the individual, the name of the State or local taxing jurisdiction paying such refund or allowing such credits or offsets, the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit or offset and a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The requirement of this paragraph may be met by furnishing to the individual a copy of the Form 1099 filed with respect to that individual provided that the form bears a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement shall be considered to be furnished to an individual if it is mailed to the individual at the individual's last known address.

For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see Sec. 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for nonitemizers. A refund officer need not furnish a statement to an individual under paragraph (k)(1) of this section if the refund officer verifies that the individual did not claim itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes for the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit, or offset. This exception shall not apply, however, if the refund, credit, or offset is made or allowed with respect to a payment attributable to an income tax that applies exclusively to income from a trade or business and is not a tax of general application. For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2), verification shall be made solely from--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State or local income tax return, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Information obtained through a voluntary information exchange agreement with the United States for the applicable taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Verification from the State or local income tax return. A refund officer shall verify from the State or local income tax return that an individual did not claim itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes for the applicable taxable year only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> An individual who itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes either must attach a copy of Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return to the State or local income tax return or must transcribe information from Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return on the State or local income tax return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An individual who itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes either must attach a copy of Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return to the State or local income tax return or must transcribe information from Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return on the State or local income tax return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information contained on or transcribed from the Schedule A is required for the purpose of computing liability for the State or local income tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The omission of a copy of the Schedule A, or of the information required to be transcribed from the Schedule A, is consistent with the taxpayer's computation of tax on the State or local income tax return; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals are required to transcribe information from their Federal income tax return (other than from Schedule A) on the State or local income tax return for the purpose of computing liability for the State or local income tax and the information can be used to determine conclusively whether the taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. State X asks for transcription of the following information on its 1983 income tax return from the taxpayer's 1983 Federal income tax return: Adjusted gross income; taxable income; and number of exemptions claimed. The amount of adjusted gross income and the number of exemptions claimed on the Federal income tax return are taken into account in computing the liability for income tax under the laws of State X. The amount of taxable income transcribed from the Federal return, however, does not enter into the computation of liability for income tax under the laws of State X. Thus, this amount may not be taken into account by the refund officer of State X for purposes of verifying whether a taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes.

Since the refund officer of State X will not be able to determine conclusively from the amount of adjusted gross income and the number of exemptions transcribed from the Federal return whether a taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes, the transcribed information does not meet the requirements of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Time for furnishing statements--(1) General rule. The statement required under paragraph (k) of this section shall be furnished after December 31 of the year in which the refund is paid or credit or offset is allowed, and on or before January 31 of the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The statement required under paragraph (k) of this section shall be furnished after December 31 of the year in which the refund is paid or credit or offset is allowed, and on or before January 31 of the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extensions of time. For good cause shown upon written application of the refund officer, the service center director may grant an extension of time not exceeding 30 days in which to furnish statements under this paragraph. The application shall be addressed to the Service Center with which the Forms 1099 required under this section are required to be filed and shall contain a concise statement of the reasons for requesting the extension to aid the service center director in determining the period of the extension, if any, which will be granted. The application shall state at the top of the first page that it is made under this section and shall be signed by the refund officer. In general, the application shall be filed after September 30 of the year in which the refund is paid or credit or offset is allowed, and before January 15 of the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to payments of refunds and credits and offsets allowed after December 31, 1982. The amendments to paragraph (k)(1) apply to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, Sec. 1.6050E-5(k)(1) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

Sec. 1.6050H-1  Information reporting of mortgage interest received ina trade or business from an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Information reporting requirement--(1) Overview. The information reporting requirements of section 6050H, this section, and Sec. 1.6050H-2 apply to an interest recipient who receives at least $600 of interest on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year or who makes a reimbursement of interest described in Sec. 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv). Paragraph (b) of this section defines qualified mortgage. Paragraph (c) of this section defines interest recipient. Paragraph (d) of this section contains additional rules relating to the reporting requirement for foreign persons, cooperative housing corporations, and nonresident alien individuals. Paragraph (e) of this section contains rules for determining the amount of interest received on a mortgage for a calendar year. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining when prepaid interest in the form of points is taken into account as interest for purposes of section 6050H, this section, and Sec. 1.6050H-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview.

Except as otherwise provided in this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2, an interest recipient that either receives at least $600 of interest on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year or makes reimbursements of interest described in Sec. 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv) must, with respect to that interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> File an information return with the Internal Revenue Service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Furnish a statement to the payor of record on the mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optional reporting. An interest recipient may, but is not required to, report its receipt of less than $600 of interest on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year. Similarly, an interest recipient also may report reimbursements of interest on a qualified mortgage even if the reimbursements are not required to be reported by Sec. 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv). An interest recipient that chooses, but is not required, to file a return as provided in this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2(a) or to furnish a statement as provided in this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2(b) is subject to the requirements of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualified mortgage--(1) In general. A mortgage is a qualified mortgage if the payor of record on the mortgage is an individual, including an individual acting in a capacity as a sole proprietor of a business. A mortgage is not a qualified mortgage if the payor of

record on the mortgage is not an individual (such as a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation), even though an individual is a co-borrower on the mortgage and all the trustees, beneficiaries, partners, members, or shareholders of the payor of record are individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A mortgage is a qualified mortgage if the payor of record on the mortgage is an individual, including an individual acting in a capacity as a sole proprietor of a business. A mortgage is not a qualified mortgage if the payor of

record on the mortgage is not an individual (such as a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation), even though an individual is a co-borrower on the mortgage and all the trustees, beneficiaries, partners, members, or shareholders of the payor of record are individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mortgage--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an obligation is a mortgage if real property (regardless of where located) secures all or part of the obligation. An interest recipient must determine whether real property secures an obligation at the time the obligation is created or, if security is added or removed at a later time, at that later time. Real property includes a manufactured home as defined in section 25(e)(10). An obligation includes a line of credit or a credit card obligation. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2, a borrower incurs a line of credit or credit card obligation when the borrower first has the right to borrow against the line of credit or credit card, whether the borrower actually borrows an amount at that time. An obligation will not fail to be treated as a mortgage solely because, under an applicable State or local homestead law or other debtor protection law in effect on August 16, 1986, the security interest is ineffective or the enforceability of the security interest is restricted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

An obligation that existed on December 31, 1984, is not a mortgage if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, the interest recipient reasonably classified the obligation as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation. A reasonable classification of an obligation must be consistent with industry practices and determined according to the purpose of the obligation, the property securing the obligation, and any other reasonable factor. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), an obligation was not reasonably classified as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, more than one-half of the obligations in the particular class in which the obligation was classified were secured primarily by real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An obligation that existed on December 31, 1984, is not a mortgage if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, the interest recipient reasonably classified the obligation as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation. A reasonable classification of an obligation must be consistent with industry practices and determined according to the purpose of the obligation, the property securing the obligation, and any other reasonable factor. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), an obligation was not reasonably classified as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, more than one-half of the obligations in the particular class in which the obligation was classified were secured primarily by real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B offers an unsecured line of credit and a line of credit secured by real property. B separately markets the two credit lines, and they are governed by different terms and conditions. For accounting purposes, B classifies the two types of loans as a single class. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the two types of loans are different classes of obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B operates a program to make loans to small businesses. Depending on the amount of the loan and the credit history of the borrower, B may or may not require security for the loan. If B requires security, it may consist of real or personal property. For accounting purposes, B classifies all of the loans within this program as a single class. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, all of the loans within this program may be classified as belonging to a single class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transitional rule for certain obligations existing on December 31, 1987. An obligation that was incurred after December 31, 1984, and that existed on December 31, 1987, is not a mortgage if the obligation is not primarily secured by real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payor of record. A payor of record on a mortgage is the person carried on the books and records of the interest recipient as the principal borrower on the mortgage. If the books and records of the interest recipient do not indicate which borrower is the principal borrower, the interest recipient must designate a borrower as the principal borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Lender of record. The lender of record is the person who, at the time the loan is made, is named as the lender on the loan documents and whose right to receive payment from the payor of record is secured by the payor of record's principal residence. An intention by the lender of record to sell or otherwise transfer the loan to a third party subsequent to the close of the transaction will not affect the determination of who is the lender of record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interest recipient--(1) Trade or business requirement. Except as provided in

paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an interest recipient is a person that is engaged in a trade or business (whether or not the trade or business of lending money) and that, in the course of the trade or business, either receives interest on a mortgage or makes a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage described in Sec. 1.6050H-2(a)(3). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), if a person holds a mortgage which was originated or acquired in the course of a trade or business, the interest on the mortgage is considered to be received in the course of that trade or business. For example, if real estate developer A lends money to individual B to enable B to purchase a house in a subdivision owned and developed by A, and B gives a mortgage to A for the loan, A is an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage. Alternatively, if C, a person engaged in the trade or business of being a physician, lends money to individual D to enable D to purchase C's home, and D gives a mortgage to C for the loan, C is not an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage, because C will not receive the interest in the course of the trade or business of being a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Trade or business requirement. Except as provided in

paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an interest recipient is a person that is engaged in a trade or business (whether or not the trade or business of lending money) and that, in the course of the trade or business, either receives interest on a mortgage or makes a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage described in Sec. 1.6050H-2(a)(3). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), if a person holds a mortgage which was originated or acquired in the course of a trade or business, the interest on the mortgage is considered to be received in the course of that trade or business. For example, if real estate developer A lends money to individual B to enable B to purchase a house in a subdivision owned and developed by A, and B gives a mortgage to A for the loan, A is an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage. Alternatively, if C, a person engaged in the trade or business of being a physician, lends money to individual D to enable D to purchase C's home, and D gives a mortgage to C for the loan, C is not an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage, because C will not receive the interest in the course of the trade or business of being a physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest received or collected on behalf of another person--(i) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section, a person that, in the course of its trade or business, receives or collects interest on a mortgage on behalf of another person (e.g., the lender of record) is the interest recipient (the initial recipient) for the mortgage. In this case, the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the transfer of interest from the initial recipient to the person for which the initial recipient receives or collects the interest. For example, if financial institution A collects interest on behalf of financial institution B, A is the initial recipient for the mortgage and is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6050H, and B is not required to report the interest received on the mortgage from A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section, a person that, in the course of its trade or business, receives or collects interest on a mortgage on behalf of another person (e.g., the lender of record) is the interest recipient (the initial recipient) for the mortgage. In this case, the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the transfer of interest from the initial recipient to the person for which the initial recipient receives or collects the interest. For example, if financial institution A collects interest on behalf of financial institution B, A is the initial recipient for the mortgage and is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6050H, and B is not required to report the interest received on the mortgage from A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception--(A) Scope of exception. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply for any period for which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An initial recipient does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person for which the interest is received or collected would receive the interest in the course of its trade or business if the interest were paid directly to that person. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), if interest is received or collected on behalf of a person other than an individual, that person is presumed to receive interest in a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application of exception. If the exception provided by this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) applies, the person for which the interest is received or collected is the interest recipient with respect to interest received or collected on the mortgage during the period described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest received in the form of points. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2, in the case of prepaid interest received in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, only the lender of record or a qualified person (as defined in Sec. 1.6050H-2(d)(2)) is treated as receiving the points. The lender of record or qualified person is treated as receiving all points paid directly by the payor of record in connection with the purchase of the principal residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If designation agreement is in effect. If a designation agreement is executed pursuant to Sec. 1.6050H-2(d) with respect to points, only the designated party under the agreement is treated as receiving points with respect to any mortgage to which the agreement applies. The designated party is treated as receiving all points with respect to any mortgage to which the agreement applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Governmental unit. A governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit that receives interest on a mortgage is an interest recipient without regard to the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of

this section that the interest be received in the course of a trade or business. A governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit that is an interest recipient must designate an officer or employee to satisfy the reporting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Financial institution F collects mortgage interest on behalf of financial institution G and deposits the amount collected into G's account held with F. F possesses the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. F is the interest recipient for the mortgage. G is not required to report.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that F does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement. G, the person for which F collects the interest, is the interest recipient for the mortgage. F is not required to report.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. S, an individual, sells real property to another individual, P, and takes back a mortgage from P to finance the sale. S does not receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. B, a bank, collects P's payments of principal and interest on behalf of S and deposits that amount into an account held at the bank in S's name. B does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. B is the interest recipient for P's mortgage without regard to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, because S would not receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. S is not required to report.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. X collects mortgage interest on behalf of Y, who would receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. X possesses the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. On July 1, 1988, Z assumes X's interest collection responsibilities. Z does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. X is the interest recipient for interest received from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988. Because Z does not possess the requisite information and Y would receive the interest in the course of a trade or business, Y is the interest recipient for interest received from July 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On December 1, Borrower obtains from Lender funds with which to purchase an existing structure to be used as Borrower's principal residence. In connection with the mortgage, Lender charges Borrower $300 as points. Borrower pays this amount to Lender at closing using unborrowed funds. In addition, Lender receives from Borrower with respect to the mortgage $300 as interest (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section) other than points. Because Lender has received at least $600 in interest, including points, with respect to Borrower's mortgage during the calendar year, Lender must report the payments in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2. Under those sections, Lender must separately state on the information return and the statement to Borrower the $300 received as interest (other than points) and the $300 received as points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional rules--(1) Reporting by foreign person. An interest recipient that is not a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) must report interest received on a qualified mortgage only if it receives the interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reporting by foreign person. An interest recipient that is not a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) must report interest received on a qualified mortgage only if it receives the interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At a location in the United States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At a location outside the United States if the interest recipient is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A person, 50 percent or more of the gross income of which, from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of the taxable year preceding the receipt of interest (or for such part of the period as the person was in existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting with respect to nonresident alien individual--(i) In general. The reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The payor of record is a nonresident alien individual, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Real property located in the United States does not secure the mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonresident alien individual status. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, an interest recipient must apply the following documentary evidence rules to determine whether a payor of record is a nonresident alien individual:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If interest is paid outside the United States, the interest recipient must satisfy the documentary evidence standard provided in Sec. 1.6049-5(c) with respect to the payor of record; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If interest is paid within the United States, the interest recipient must secure from the payor of record a Form W-8 or a substantially similar statement signed by the payor under penalty of perjury as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1).

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), the place of payment is the place where the payor of record completes the acts necessary to effect payment. An amount paid by transfer to an account maintained by an interest recipient in the United States or by mail to a United States address is considered to be paid within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting by cooperative housing corporations. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2, an amount received by a cooperative housing corporation from an individual tenant-stockholder that represents the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of interest described in section 216(a)(2) is interest received on a qualified mortgage in the course of the cooperative housing corporation's trade or business. A cooperative housing corporation is an interest recipient with respect to each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of interest and must report $600 or more of interest received from an individual tenant-stockholder. The terms ``cooperative housing corporation,'' ``tenant-stockholder,'' and ``tenant-stockholder's proportionate share'' are defined in section 216 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amount of interest received on mortgage for calendar year--(1) In general. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2, interest includes mortgage prepayment penalties and late charges other than late charges for a specific mortgage service. Interest also includes prepaid interest in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Whether an interest recipient receives $600 or more of interest on a mortgage for a calendar year is determined on a mortgage-by-mortgage basis. An interest recipient need not aggregate interest received on all of the mortgages of a payor of record held by the interest recipient to determine whether the $600 threshold is met. Therefore, an interest recipient need not report interest of less than $600 received on a mortgage, even though it receives a total of $600 or more of interest on all of the mortgages of the payor of record for a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the calendar year for which interest is received is the later of the calendar year in which the interest is received or the calendar year in which the interest properly accrues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the calendar year for which interest is received is the later of the calendar year in which the interest is received or the calendar year in which the interest properly accrues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> De minimis rule. An interest recipient may treat interest received during the current calendar year which properly accrues by January 15 of the subsequent calendar year as interest received for the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly interest payment on December 31, 1988, which includes interest accruing for the period December 5, 1988, to January 5, 1989, the interest recipient may treat the entire interest payment as received for 1988. If a portion of an interest payment received in a current calendar year accrues after January 15 of the subsequent calendar year, an interest recipient must report as interest received for the current calendar year only the portion that properly accrues by the end of the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly payment that includes interest accruing for the period December 20, 1988, through January 20, 1989, the interest recipient may not report as interest received for 1988 any interest accruing after December 31, 1988. The interest recipient must report the interest accruing after December 31, 1988, as received for calendar year 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Applicability to points. Paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to prepaid interest in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be reported in the calendar year in which they are received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain interest not received on mortgage--(i) Interest received from seller on payor of record's mortgage. Interest received from a seller or a person related to a seller within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) on a

payor of record's mortgage is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if a real estate developer deposits an amount in escrow with an interest recipient and advises it to draw on the account to pay interest on a payor of record's mortgage (e.g., a buy-down mortgage). Similarly, interest is not received on a mortgage if an interest recipient receives a lump sum from a real estatge developer for interest on a payor of record's mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest received from seller on payor of record's mortgage. Interest received from a seller or a person related to a seller within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) on a

payor of record's mortgage is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if a real estate developer deposits an amount in escrow with an interest recipient and advises it to draw on the account to pay interest on a payor of record's mortgage (e.g., a buy-down mortgage). Similarly, interest is not received on a mortgage if an interest recipient receives a lump sum from a real estatge developer for interest on a payor of record's mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest received from governmental unit. Interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if received as a housing assistance payment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on a mortgage insured under section 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701-1715z (1982 & Supp. 1983)). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) (1) and (2) of this section, interest received on a mortgage is only the excess of interest received on the mortgage over interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest calculated under Rule of 78s method of accounting. An interest recipient permitted by Revenue Procedure 83-40, 1983-1, C.B. 774 (or other revenue procedure) to use the Rule of 78s method of accounting to calculate interest earned on a transaction may report as interest received on a mortgage interest earned on the transaction as calculated under the Rule of 78s method of accounting only if the interest recipient satisfies the notice requirement of Sec. 1.6050H-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Points treated as interest--(1) General rule.

The provisions of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Financed payment of points. Buyer purchases a principal residence for $100,000. There is a total of $7,000 in closing costs (exclusive of down payment) charged in connection with the sale. Of this amount, $3,000 is charged as points (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section). At closing, Buyer makes a down payment of $20,000 and provides unborrowed funds in the amount of $4,000 for the payment of various closing costs other than points. Buyer finances payment of the points by increasing the principal amount of the loan by $3,000. Seller makes no payments on Buyer's behalf. Because Buyer has provided at closing funds that have not been borrowed from the lender of record for this purpose in an amount at least equal to the amount charged as points in the transaction, the lender of record (or a qualified person) must report $3,000 as points in accordance with this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Seller-paid points. Buyer purchases a principal residence for $100,000. There is a total of $7,000 in closing costs (exclusive of down payment) charged in connection with the sale. Of this amount, $3,000 is charged as points (within the meaning of this paragraph (f)). Seller agrees to pay all closing costs on behalf of Buyer, including the amount charged as points. Accordingly, the amount paid by Seller as points is treated as paid directly by Buyer, and the lender of record (or a qualified person) must report the $3,000 as points in accordance with this section and Sec. 1.6050H-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Construction loans--(i) In general.

Sec. 1.6050H-1T  Information reporting of mortgage interest receivedin a trade or business from individuals after 1985 and before 1988(temporary).</p><p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to the requirement of reporting mortgage interest under section 6050H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 145 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 685):</p><p class="depth0">Requirement of Reporting</p><p class="depth0">In general</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What does section 6050H provide with respect to the reporting of mortgage interest?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: In general, section 6050H provides that an information return must be made by any person who is engaged in a trade or business and who, in the course of such trade or business, receives from any individual $600 or more of interest on any mortgage in a calendar year. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person who is engaged in a trade or business and who, in the course of such trade or business, receives interest on any mortgage is referred to as an ``interest recipient''; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any individual who pays interest on any mortgage is referred to as a ``payor''.</p><p class="depth0">Interest Subject to Reporting</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Does the reporting requirement apply to all interest received by an interest recipient?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: No. The reporting requirement applies only to interest received from a payor on a mortgage (as defined in A-4 and A-5 of this section). The reporting requirement does not apply to interest received from a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Does the reporting requirement apply to any amount of mortgage interest received from a payor?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: No. The reporting requirement applies only if $600 or more of interest is received from a payor on any mortgage in a calendar year. The $600 threshold is determined on an obligation by obligation basis. Therefore, if the interest received from a payor on an obligation is less than $600, reporting with respect to that interest is not required even if the total interest received from the payor on all obligations held by the interest recipient exceeds $600 in a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What is a mortgage, for purposes of this section and section 6050H, with respect to obligations in existence on December 31, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: An obligation in existence on December 31, 1984, that is secured primarily by real property (regardless of whether the property is located inside or outside the United States) is a mortgage unless, at the time the obligation was incurred, the interest recipient reasonably classified such obligation as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation. (See A-12 of this section for rules relating to interest received by foreign persons.) For example, if an obligation incurred in 1980 was secured primarily by real property, but the interest recipient reasonably classified the obligation as a commercial loan because the proceeds were used to finance the payor's trade or business, the obligation is not considered a mortgage for purposes of this section and section 6050H. If, however, a majority of the obligations in a particular class are primarily secured by real property, it is not reasonable to classify such obligations as other than mortgages, real property loans, real estate loans, or other similar types of obligations; such obligations are, therefore, mortgages for purposes of section 6050H and this section. For purposes of this definition, real property includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation. A mortgage does not include a credit card obligation that is secured primarily by real property or a line of credit that is secured primarily by real property.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is a mortgage, for purposes of this section and section 6050H, with respect to obligations incurred after December 31, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: With respect to obligations incurred after December 31, 1984, a mortgage is any obligation that is secured primarily by real property, regardless of whether the property is located inside or outside the United States. (See A-12 of this section for rules relating to interest received by foreign persons.) For purposes of this definition, real property includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation. A mortgage does not include a credit card obligation that is secured primarily by real property or a line of credit that is secured primarily by real property. The determination of whether a particular obligation is a mortgage shall be made without regard to the interest recipient's classification of that obligation. For example, if an obligation is secured primarily by real property, but the interest recipient classifies the obligation as a commercial loan because the proceeds are to be used to finance the payor's trade or business, the obligation is nevertheless a mortgage for purposes of this section and section 6050H.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: If the amount of interest received on a mortgage in a calendar year is less than the amount of interest due on the mortgage, what amount of interest must be reported under this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: The amount of interest received must be reported. For example, assume that $800 of interest is payable in a calendar year but only $600 of interest is received in the calendar year. The amount of interest received ($600) must be reported under this section. Similarly, assume that an interest recipient accrues $900 of interest on a mortgage in a calendar year but only $800 of interest is payable and is received in the calendar year (resulting in a $100 increase in the unpaid balance of the loan). The amount of interest received ($800) must be reported under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: If a payor remits 13 payments of interest on any mortgage in a calendar year, but the interest recipient receives only 12 payments in the calendar year, what amount should the interest recipient report?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: The interest recipient should report the interest actually received in the calendar year. For example, if a payor mails the 13th payment on December 31 or a calendar year, and the interest recipient does not receive it until the following calendar year, the interest recipient should report only the 12 payments received in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Trade or Business Requirement</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: Must an interest recipient be engaged in the trade or business of lending money to be subject to the reporting requirement of this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: No. An interest recipient (other than a governmental unit, or any agency or instrumentality thereof) is subject to this reporting requirement if the interest recipient is engaged in any trade or business and, in the course of such trade or business, receives from an individual $600 or more of interest on any mortgage in a calendar year. For example, if A, a real estate developer, provides financing to B, an individual, to enable B to purchase a house in a subdivision owner and developed by A, and that house is the primary security for the financing, A is subject to this reporting requirement. Alternatively, if C, a physician, who is not engaged in any other trade or business, lends money to D to enable D to purchase C's home, C is not subject to the reporting requirement of this section because C will not receive the interest in the course of his sole trade or business of being a physician.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: How does the trade or business requirement apply to a governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) which receives from a payor $600 or more of interest on any mortgage in a calendar year is subject to the reporting requirement without regard to the requirement that the money be received in the course of a trade or business. A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) that is subject to the reporting requirement must designate an officer or employee to make the return. The designated officer or employee must make the return in the form and manner prescribed by this section.</p><p class="depth0">Treatment of Cooperative Housing Corporations</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: How does this reporting requirement apply in the case of cooperative housing corporation?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: For purposes of section 6050H and this section, a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in section 216) is treated as a person who is engaged in a trade or business and who, in the course of such trade or business, receives interest from its tenant-stockholders on a mortgage. Therefore, a cooperative housing corporation is required to report under section 6050H and this section.</p><p class="depth0">Interest Received on Behalf of Another</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: If, in the course of a trade or business, a person receives (collects) interest on behalf of another, who is required to report?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: The person first receiving (collecting) the interest is required to report. For example, a servicing bank that receives $600 or more of mortgage interest in a calendar year from a payor on behalf of a lender is required to report the interest received under this section. No reporting is required under this section upon the transfer of the interest from the servicing bank to the lender for whom the interest was received.</p><p class="depth0">Interest Received by Foreign Persons</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Must an interest recipient that is a foreign person report under section 6050H and this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: An interest recipient that is a foreign person must report with respect to mortgage interest that is received at a location within the United States. In the case of interest received at locations outside the United States, an interest recipient that is a foreign person must report--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the foreign person is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the foreign person is a corporation any interest received from which would be considered to be from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(1)(C) (without regard to whether the interest is paid or credited by a domestic branch of a foreign corporation engaged in the commercial banking business).</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: When there is more than one borrower on a mortgage, must the interest recipient report with respect to each borrower?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: No. The interest recipient must report only with respect to the payor of record (as defined in A-14 of this section) on the mortgage. The amount of interest subject to reporting is the full amount received by the interest recipient with respect to the mortgage during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: Who is a payor of record?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: For purposes of this section, the payor of record is the individual carried on the books and records of the interest recipient as the principal borrower or the individual designated by the interest recipient as the payor of record.</p><p class="depth0">Interest Paid by Third Parties</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: If an interest recipient receives interest on a mortgage from a person other than the borrower, must the interest recipient report this amount as received from the borrower?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: In general, yes. Except as otherwise provided in this A-15 and A-15a of this section, an interest recipient must report all amounts received on a borrower's mortgage as received from the borrower under section 6050H and this section. For example, assume that N is the borrower on a mortgage and that interest is received on the mortgage from N's mother. The interest that is received from N's mother on N's mortgage is reportable under section 6050H and this section as received from N. However, interest that is paid by a seller on a purchaser's mortgage shall not be reported under section 6050H and this section as received from the purchaser. For example, if a real estate developer deposits an amount in escrow with the interest recipient and advises the interest recipient to draw on the account to pay interest on a purchaser's mortgage, this interest is not reportable under section 6050H and this section. Similarly, if a real estate developer pays a lump sum to the interest recipient for interest on a purchaser's mortgage, this interest is not reportable under section 6050H and this section. In addition, amounts received by the interest recipient as housing assistance payments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD'') on a borrower's mortgage that is insured under section 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701-1715z (1982 and Supp. 1983)) shall not be reported as interest received from the borrower. In such a case, therefore, only the amount of interest received on the mortgage that exceeds the amount of housing assistance payments received from HUD shall be reported.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15a: If an interest recipient receives, with respect to a borrower's mortgage, an amount from a governmental unit, or any agency or instrumentality thereof (other than an amount received from HUD as described in A-15 of this section), should the interest recipient report the amount as received from the borrower?</p><p class="depth0">A-15a: If the interest is received after December 31, 1986, it must be reported in the same manner as interest on mortgages with respect to which housing assistance payments are received from HUD, as described in A-15 of this section. If the interest is received before January 1, 1987, it may, but need not, be reported.</p><p class="depth0">Form and Manner of Return</p><p class="depth0">Form of Return</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: What form must be used to make a return required by section 6050H and this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: An interest recipient must make the return on Form 1098 (with Form 1096 as the transmittal form). The interest recipient may, however, prepare and use a form that contains provisions substantially similar to those of Forms 1096 and 1098 if that person complies with any revenue procedures relating to substitute Forms 1096 and 1098 in effect at that time. A separate return must be made for each mortgage with respect to which $600 or more of interest is received for a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Information Included on Return</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: What information must an interest recipient include on Form 1098?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: An interest recipient must include the following information on the Form 1098:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The name, address, and TIN (as defined in section 7701(a)) of the payor or payor of record;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The name and address of the interest recipient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of interest (not including points and other prepaid interest) received on the mortgage in the calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any other information as may be required by Form 1098 or its instructions.</p><p class="depth0">Time for Filing</p><p class="depth0">Q-18: When must an interest recipient file the return or returns required by section 6050H and this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-18: An interest recipient must file the return or returns on or before February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the mortgage interest is received.</p><p class="depth0">Place for Filing</p><p class="depth0">Q-19: Where must the return or returns required under section 6050H and this section be filed?</p><p class="depth0">A-19: The return or returns must be filed with the same Internal Revenue Service Center where other returns of the interest recipient are filed.</p><p class="depth0">Use of Magnetic Media</p><p class="depth0">Q-20: What rules apply with respect to the use of magnetic media?</p><p class="depth0">A-20: Any return required under section 6050H and this section must be filed on magnetic media to the extent required by section 6011(e) and the regulations thereunder. Any person not required by section 6011(e) to file returns on magnetic media may request permission to do so.

Sec. 1.6050I-1  Returns relating to cash in excess of $10,000 receivedin a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reporting requirement--(1) Reportable transaction--(i) In general. Any person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who, in the course of a trade or business in which such person is engaged, receives cash in excess of $10,000 in 1 transaction (or 2 or more related transactions) shall, except as otherwise provided, make a return of information with respect to the receipt of cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reportable transaction--(i) In general. Any person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who, in the course of a trade or business in which such person is engaged, receives cash in excess of $10,000 in 1 transaction (or 2 or more related transactions) shall, except as otherwise provided, make a return of information with respect to the receipt of cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Any person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who, in the course of a trade or business in which such person is engaged, receives cash in excess of $10,000 in 1 transaction (or 2 or more related transactions) shall, except as otherwise provided, make a return of information with respect to the receipt of cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain financial transactions. Section 6050I of title 26 of the United States Code requires persons to report

information about financial transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, and section 5331 of title 31 of the United States Code requires persons to report similar information about certain transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. This information shall be reported on the same form as prescribed by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cash received for the account of another. Cash in excess of $10,000 received by a person for the account of another must be reported under this section. Thus, for example, a person who collects delinquent accounts receivable for an automobile dealer must report with respect to the receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 from the collection of a particular account even though the proceeds of the collection are credited to the account of the automobile dealer (i.e., where the rights to the proceeds from the account are retained by the automobile dealer and the collection is made on a fee-for-service basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cash received by agents--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a person who in the course of a trade or business acts as an agent (or in some other similar capacity) and receives cash in excess of $10,000 from a principal, must report the receipt of cash under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a person who in the course of a trade or business acts as an agent (or in some other similar capacity) and receives cash in excess of $10,000 from a principal, must report the receipt of cash under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. An agent who receives cash from a principal and uses all of the cash within 15 days in a cash transaction (the ``second cash transaction'') which is reportable under section 6050I or 5312 of title 31 of the United States Code and the regulations thereunder (31 CFR Part 103), and who discloses the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the principal to the recipient in the second cash transaction need not report the initial receipt of cash under this section. An agent will be deemed to have met the disclosure requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) if the agent discloses only the name of the principal and the agent knows that the recipient has the principal's address and taxpayer identification number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. B, the principal, gives D, an attorney, $75,000 in cash to purchase real property on behalf of B. Within 15 days D purchases real property for cash from E, a real estate developer, and discloses to E, B's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. Because the transaction qualifies for the exception provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, D need not report with respect to the initial receipt of cash under this section. The exception does not apply, however, if D pays E by means other than cash, or effects the purchase more than 15 days following receipt of the cash from B, or fails to disclose B's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (assuming D does not know that E already has B's address and taxpayer identification number), or purchases the property from a person whose sale of the property is not in the course of that person's trade or business. In any such case, D is required to report the receipt of cash from B under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiple payments. The receipt of multiple cash deposits or cash installment payments (or other similar payments or prepayments) on or after January 1, 1990, relating to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), is reported as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Initial payment in excess of $10,000. If the initial payment exceeds $10,000, the recipient must report the initial payment within 15 days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial payment of $10,000 or less. If the initial payment does not exceed $10,000, the recipient must aggregate the initial payment and subsequent payments made within one year of the initial payment until the aggregate amount exceeds $10,000, and report with respect to the aggregate amount within 15 days after receiving the payment that causes the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsequent payments. In addition to any other required report, a report must be made each time that previously unreportable payments made within a 12-month period with respect to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), individually or in the aggregate, exceed $10,000. The report must be made within 15 days after receiving the payment in excess of $10,000 or the payment that causes the aggregate amount received in the 12- month period to exceed $10,000. (If more

than one report would otherwise be required for multiple cash payments within a 15-day period that relate to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), the recipient may make a single combined report with respect to the payments. The combined report must be made no later than the date by which the first of the separate reports would otherwise be required to be made.) A report with respect to payments of $10,000 or less that are reportable under this paragraph (b)(3) and are received after December 31, 1989, but before July 10, 1990, is due July 24, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 10, 1991, M receives an initial cash payment of $11,000 with respect to a transaction. M receives subsequent cash payments with respect to the same transaction of $4,000 on February 15, 1991, $6,000 on March 20, 1991, and $12,000 on May 15, 1991. M must make a report with respect to the payment received on January 10, 1991, by January 25, 1991. M must also make a report with respect to the payments totalling $22,000 received from February 15, 1991, through May 15, 1991. This report must be made by May 30, 1991, that is, within 15 days of the date that the subsequent payments, all of which were received within a 12-month period, exceeded $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash--(i) Amounts received prior to February 3, 1992. For amounts received prior to February 3, 1992, the term cash means the coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts received prior to February 3, 1992. For amounts received prior to February 3, 1992, the term cash means the coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts received on or after February 3, 1992. For amounts received on or after February 3, 1992, the term cash means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A cashier's check (by whatever name called, including ``treasurer's check'' and ``bank check''), bank draft, traveler's check, or money order having a face amount of not more than $10,000--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Received in a designated reporting transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section (except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Received in any transaction in which the recipient knows that such instrument is being used in an attempt to avoid the reporting of the transaction under section 6050I and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Designated reporting transaction. A designated reporting transaction is a retail sale (or the receipt of funds by a broker or other intermediary in connection with a retail sale) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A consumer durable,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A collectible, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A travel or entertainment activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exception for certain loans. A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(l)(ii)(B)(1) of this section if the instrument constitutes the proceeds of a loan from a bank (as that term is defined in 31 CFR part 103). The recipient may rely on a copy of the loan document, a written statement from the bank, or similar documentation (such as a written lien instruction from the issuer of the instrument) to substantiate that the instrument constitutes loan proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Exception for certain installment sales. A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section if the instrument is received in payment on a promissory note or an installment sales contract (including a lease that is considered to be a sale for Federal income tax purposes). However, the preceding sentence applies only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Promissory notes or installment sales contracts with the same or substantially similar terms are used in the ordinary course of the recipient's trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate consumers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of payments with respect to the sale that are received on or before the 60th day after the date of the sale does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Exception for certain down payment plans. A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section is the instrument is received pursuant to a payment plan requiring one or more down payments and the payment of the balance of the purchase price by a date no later than the date of the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, a date no later than the earliest date that any item of travel or entertainment pertaining to the same trip or event is furnished). However, the preceding sentence applies only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The recipient uses payment plans with the same or substantially similar terms in the ordinary course of its trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate consumers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The instrument is received more than 60 days prior to the date of the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, the date on which the final payment is due).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the definition of ``cash'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(l)(ii) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D, an individual, purchases gold coins from M, a coin dealer, for $13,200. D tenders to M in payment United States currency in the amount of $6,200 and a cashier's check in the face amount of $7,000 which D had purchased. Because the sale is a designated reporting transaction, the cashier's check is treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. Therefore, because M has received more than $10,000 in cash with respect to the transaction, M must make the report required by section 6050I and this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. E, an individual, purchases an automobile from Q, an automobile dealer, for $11,500. E tenders to Q in payment United States currency in the amount of $2,000 and a cashier's check payable to E and Q in the amount of $9,500. The cashier's check constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the bank issuing the check. The origin of the proceeds is evident from provisions inserted by the bank on the check that instruct the dealer to cause a lien to be placed on the vehicle as security for the loan. The sale of the automobile is a designated reporting transaction. However, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, because E has furnished Q documentary information establishing that the cashier's check constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the bank issuing the check, the cashier's check is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. F, an individual, purchases an item of jewelry from S, a retail jeweler, for $12,000. F gives S traveler's checks totalling $2,400 and pays the balance with a personal check payable to S in the amount of $9,600. Because the sale is a designated reporting transaction, the traveler's checks are treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. However, because the personal check is not treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section, S has not received more than $10,000 in cash in the transaction and no report is required to be filed under section 6050I and this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. G, an individual, purchases a boat from T, a boat dealer, for $16,500. G pays T with a cashier's check payable to T in the amount of $16,500. The cashier's check is not treated as cash because the face amount of the check is more than $10,000. Thus, no report is required to be made by T under section 6050I and this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. H, an individual, arranges with W, a travel agent, for the chartering of a passenger aircraft to transport a group of individuals to a sports event in another city. H also arranges with W for hotel accommodations for the group and for admission tickets to the sports event. In payment, H tenders to W money orders which H had previously purchased. The total amount of the money orders, none of which individually exceeds $10,000 in face amount, exceeds $10,000. Because the transaction is a designated reporting transaction, the money orders are treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. Therefore, because W has received more than $10,000 in cash with respect to the transaction, W must make the report required by section 6050I and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consumer durable. The term consumer durable means an item of tangible personal property of a type that is suitable under ordinary usage for personal consumption or use, that can reasonably be expected to be useful for at least 1 year under ordinary usage, and that has a sales price of more than $10,000. Thus, for example, a $20,000 automobile is a consumer durable (whether or not it is sold for business use), but a $20,000 dump truck or a $20,000 factory machine is not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Collectible. The term collectible means an item described in paragraphs (A) through (D) of section 408(m)(2) (determined without regard to section 408(m)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Travel or entertainment activity. The term travel or entertainment activity means an item of travel or entertainment (within the meaning of Sec. 1.274-2(b)(1)) pertaining to a single trip or event where the aggregate sales price of the item and all other items pertaining to the same trip or event that are sold in the same transaction (or related transactions) exceeds $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Retail sale. The term retail sale means any sale (whether for resale or for any other purpose) made in the course of a trade or business if that trade or business principally consists of making sales to ultimate consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Trade or business. The term trade or business has the same meaning as under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transaction--(i) The term transaction means the underlying event precipitating the payer's transfer of cash to the recipient. Transactions include (but are not limited to) a sale of goods or services; a sale of real property; a sale of intangible property; a rental of real or personal property; an exchange of cash for other cash; the establishment or maintenance of or contribution to a custodial, trust, or escrow arrangement; a payment of a preexisting debt; a conversion of cash to a negotiable instrument; a reimbursement for expenses paid; or the making or repayment of a loan. A transaction may not be divided into multiple transactions in order to avoid reporting under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term transaction means the underlying event precipitating the payer's transfer of cash to the recipient. Transactions include (but are not limited to) a sale of goods or services; a sale of real property; a sale of intangible property; a rental of real or personal property; an exchange of cash for other cash; the establishment or maintenance of or contribution to a custodial, trust, or escrow arrangement; a payment of a preexisting debt; a conversion of cash to a negotiable instrument; a reimbursement for expenses paid; or the making or repayment of a loan. A transaction may not be divided into multiple transactions in order to avoid reporting under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term related transactions means any transaction conducted between a payer (or its agent) and a recipient of cash in a 24-hour period. Additionally, transactions conducted between a payer (or its agent) and a cash recipient during a period of more than 24 hours are related if the recipient knows or has reason to know that each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following examples illustrate the definition of paragraphs (c)(7) (i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A person has a tacit agreement with a gold dealer to purchase $36,000 in gold bullion. The $36,000 purchase represents a single transaction under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the reporting requirements of this section cannot be avoided by recasting the single sales transaction into 4 separate $9,000 sales transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An attorney agrees to represent a client in a criminal case with the attorney's fee to be determined on an hourly basis. In the first month in which the attorney represents the client, the bill for the attorney's services comes to $8,000 which the client pays in cash. In the second month in which the attorney represents the client, the bill for the attorney's services comes to $4,000, which the client again pays in cash. The aggregate amount of cash paid ($12,000) relates to a single transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, the sale of legal services relating to the criminal case, and the receipt of cash must be reported under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A person intends to contribute a total of $45,000 to a trust fund, and the trustee of the fund knows or has reason to know of that intention. The $45,000 contribution is a single transaction under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the reporting requirement of this section cannot be avoided by the grantor's making five separate $9,000 cash contributions to a single fund or by making five $9,000 cash contributions to five separate funds administered by a common trustee.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. K, an individual, attends a one day auction and purchases for cash two items, at a cost of $9,240 and $1,732.50 respectively (tax and buyer's premium included). Because the transactions are related transactions as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the auction house is required to report the aggregate amount of cash received from the related sales ($10,972.50), even though the auction house accounts separately on its books for each item sold and presents the purchaser with separate bills for each item purchased.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. F, a coin dealer, sells for cash $9,000 worth of gold coins to an individual on three successive days. Under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section the three $9,000 transactions are related transactions aggregating $27,000 if F knows, or has reason to know, that each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recipient. (i) The term recipient means the person receiving the cash. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, each store, division, branch, department, headquarters, or office (``branch'') (regardless of physical location) comprising a portion of a person's trade or business

shall for purposes of this section be deemed a separate recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term recipient means the person receiving the cash. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, each store, division, branch, department, headquarters, or office (``branch'') (regardless of physical location) comprising a portion of a person's trade or business

shall for purposes of this section be deemed a separate recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A branch that receives cash payments will not be deemed a separate recipient if the branch (or a central unit linking such branch with other branches) would in the ordinary course of business have reason to know the identity of payers making cash payments to other branches of such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. N, an individual, purchases regulated futures contracts at a cost of $7,500 and $5,000, respectively, through two different branches of Commodities Broker X on the same day. N pays for each purchase with cash. Each branch of Commodities Broker X transmits the sales information regarding each of N's purchases to a central unit of Commodities Broker X (which settles the transactions against N's account). Under paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section the separate branches of Commodities Broker X are not deemed to be separate recipients; therefore. Commodities Broker X must report with respect to the two related regulated futures contracts sales in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. P, a corporation, owns and operates a racetrack. P's racetrack contains 100 betting windows at which pari-mutuel wagers may be made. R, an individual, places cash wagers of $3,000 each at five separate betting windows. Assuming that in the ordinary course of business each betting window (or a central unit linking windows) does not have reason to know the identity of persons making wagers at other betting windows, each betting window would be deemed to be a separate cash recipient under paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. As no individual recipient received cash in excess of $10,000, no report need be made by P under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to the reporting requirements of section 6050I--(1) Receipt of cash by certain financial institutions. A financial institution as defined in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (J), (K), (R), and (S) of section 5312 (a)(2) of title 31, United States Code is not required to report the receipt of cash exceeding $10,000 under section 6050I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receipt of cash by certain financial institutions. A financial institution as defined in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (J), (K), (R), and (S) of section 5312 (a)(2) of title 31, United States Code is not required to report the receipt of cash exceeding $10,000 under section 6050I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receipt of cash by certain casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000--(i) In general. If a casino receives cash in excess of $10,000 and is required to report the receipt of such cash directly to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25 and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 31 CFR 103.36, then the casino is not required to make a return with respect to the receipt of such cash under section 6050I and these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a casino receives cash in excess of $10,000 and is required to report the receipt of such cash directly to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25 and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 31 CFR 103.36, then the casino is not required to make a return with respect to the receipt of such cash under section 6050I and these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Casinos exempt under 31 CFR 103.45(c). Under the authority of section 6050I(c)(1)(A), the Secretary may exempt from the reporting requirements of section 6050I casinos with gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000 that are exempt under 31 CFR 103.45(c) from reporting certain cash transactions to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25. The determination whether a casino which is granted an exemption under 31 CFR 103.45(c) will be required to report under section 6050I will be made on a case by case basis, concurrently with the granting of such an exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reporting of cash received in a nongaming business. Nongaming businesses (such as shops, restaurants, entertainment, and hotels) at casino hotels and resorts are separate trades or businesses in which the receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 is reportable under section 6050I and these regulations. Thus, a casino exempt under paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section must report with respect to cash in excess of $10,000 received in its nongaming businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A and B are casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000. C is a casino with gross annual gaming revenue of less than $1,000,000. Casino A receives $15,000 in cash from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction which the casino reports to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25. Casino B receives $15,000 in cash from a customer in payment for accommodations provided to that customer at Casino B's hotel. Casino C receives $15,000 in cash from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction. Casino A is not required to report the transaction under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception for certain casinos provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (``the casino exception'') applies. Casino B is required

to report under section 6050I and these regulations because the casino exception does not apply to the receipt of cash from a nongaming activity. Casino C is required to report under section 6050I and these regulations because the casino exception does not apply to casinos having gross annual gaming revenue of $1,000,000 or less which do not have to report to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Receipt of cash not in the course of the recipient's trade or business. The receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 by a person other than in the course of the person's trade or business is not reportable under section 6050I. Thus, for example, F, an individual in the trade or business of selling real estate, sells a motorboat for $12,000, the purchase price of which is paid in cash. F did not use the motorboat in any trade or business in which F was engaged. F is not required to report under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception provided in this paragraph (d)(3) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Receipt is made with respect to a foreign cash transaction--(i) In general. Generally, there is no requirement to report with respect to a cash transaction if the entire transaction occurs outside the United States (the fifty states and the District of Columbia). An entire transaction consists of both the transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the receipt of cash by the recipient. If, however, any part of an entire transaction occurs in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a possession or territory of the United States and the recipient of cash in that transaction is subject to the general jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service under title 26 of the United States Code, the recipient is required to report the transaction under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Upon delivery of the airplane in Mexico, W receives $125,000 in cash. W is not required to report under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section (``foreign transaction exception'') applies.

Sec. 1.6050J-1T  Questions and answers concerning information returnsrelating to foreclosures and abandonments of security (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to the requirement of reporting foreclosures and abandonments of security under section 6050J of the Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954, as added by section 148 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 687).</p><p class="depth0">Requirement of Reporting</p><p class="depth0">In General</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What does section 6050J provide with respect to the reporting of acquisitions and abandonments of property that secures indebtedness?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Section 6050J provides that an information return must be made by any person who, in connection with a trade or business conducted by the person (except as provided in A-13), lends money and, in full or partial satisfaction of the debt, acquires an interest in any property that is security for the debt, or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. For purposes of these questions and answers, a person who lends money in connection with a trade or business is referred to as a ``lender''.</p><p class="depth0">Trade or Business Requirement</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Must a person be in the trade or business of lending money in order to be subject to the reporting requirement of this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: No. A person does not have to be in the trade or business of lending money to be subject to this reporting requirement. Thus, if L sells automobiles and lends money to B to enable B to purchase an automobile from L for use in B's trade or business, and that automobile is security for the loan, L would be subject to this reporting requirement. Similarly, if P promotes interests in an oil well, and lends money to I to enable I to invest in the oil well which is security for the loan, P would be subject to this reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of pools, fixed investment trusts, or other similar arrangements through which undivided beneficial interests or participations in indebtedness are offered?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: In these cases, the owners of the undivided beneficial interests or participations are not subject to this reporting requirement. Instead, the trustee, record owner, or person acting in a similar capacity is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report. For purposes of both section 6050J and the applicable penalty provisions, only one return and one statement must be filed with respect to each loan or other evidence of indebtedness. For situations when more than one return or statement must be filed, see A-29, A-31, and A-41. The trustee, record owner, or person acting in a similar capacity, rather than the owners of beneficial interests or participations, is subject to the applicable penalty provisions (see A-43).</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of corporate, tax-exempt, or other bond issues?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: In these cases, the owners or holders of a bond issue are not required to report. Instead, the trustee or person acting in a similar capacity is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report. For purposes of both section 6050J and the applicable penalty provisions, only one return and one statement must be filed with respect to a bond issue. For situations when more than one return or statement must be filed, see A-29, A-31, and A-41. The trustee or person acting in a similar capacity, rather than the owners or holders of a bond issue, is subject to the applicable penalty provisions (see A-43).</p><p class="depth0">Property Subject to Reporting</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Does the reporting requirement apply to all types of property securing indebtedness?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. The reporting requirement does not apply to any loan made to an individual and secured by an interest in tangible personal property which is neither held for investment nor used in a trade or business. For rules governing when the reporting requirment applies to tangible personal property of a type ordinarily used for personal purposes, see A-8.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Does the reporting requirement apply when property securing indebtedness is held both for personal use and for use in a trade or business?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: Yes. The reporting requirement applies when property securing indebtedness is held both for personal use and for use in a trade or business. Similarly, the reporting requirement applies when the borrower holds such property both for personal use and for investment purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: Does the reporting requirement apply to indebtedness secured by a personal residence?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: Yes. A lender is subject to the reporting requirement if the property that is security for the loan is real property, including a personal residence, whether or not held for investment or used in a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: In the case of a loan made to an individual and secured by personal property of a type that is ordinarily used for personal purposes, how does a lender know whether such property is used in a trade or business or held for investment purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: In the case of a loan made to an individual and secured by personal property of a type that is ordinarily used for personal purposes, such as an automobile, computer, or boat, the lender is subject to the reporting requirement if the lender knows that the property will be used in a trade or business or held for investment purposes. For this purpose, a lender knows information if the information is included on the books and records of the lender or its agents pertaining to the loan, or is known by the lender or agent's officers, partners, principals or employees, but only if such information was acquired in the course of their ordinary business activities on behalf of the lender. For example, if a borrower indicates on the loan agreement or disclosure statement that the borrower intends to use the property securing the loan in the borrower's trade or business, the lender is subject to this reporting requirement. Similarly, if the borrower notifies the lender that the borrower intends to convert the property from personal use to use in a trade or business, the lender is subject to the reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: If a lender maintains a system under which the lender classifies loans according to the use of property that secures the loan (such as use in a trade or business or personal use), may the lender rely on this system in determining whether the reporting requirement applies?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Yes. A lender may rely on the classification system to determine whether the reporting requirement applies, provided that the classification system is designed and reasonably maintained to ensure accuracy in identifying the use of property.</p><p class="depth0">Acquisition of an Interest</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: For purposes of the reporting requirement, when is a lender treated as acquiring an interest in property that is security for indebtedness?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: In general, an interest in property is acquired on the earlier of the date title is transferred to the lender or the date possession and the burdens and benefits of ownership are transferred to the lender. If State or other applicable law provides for an objection period within which the borrower and other appropriate parties may object to the lender's proposal to retain the property in satisfaction of the indebtedness, a lender is treated as acquiring an interest in the property on the date this objection period expires. If the lender purchases the property at a sale held to satisfy the indebtedness, such as at a foreclosure or execution sale, the lender is treated as acquiring an interest in the property on the later of the date of the sale or the date the borrower's right of redemption, if any, expires. See 4A-15 for rules governing reporting when a party other than the lender acquires property securing indebtedness at a foreclosure, execution or similar sale.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: If a lender takes possession of property that is security for a loan for a limited purpose, such as completing construction on or improvement to the property, is the lender treated as having acquired an interest in the property at that point?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: No. The lender in these circumstances is not treated as acquiring an interest in the property. However, the lender must report if he later acquires an interest in the property in full or partial satisfaction of the indebtedness (see A-10 or A-15).</p><p class="depth0">Indirect Acquisition</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: If a lender acquires an interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity in full or partial satisfaction of a loan that is secured by the assets or property owned by the partnership, trust, or other entity, is the lender treated as acquiring an interest in the property securing the loan?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: Yes. A lender in this case acquires an interest in the underlying assets or property and the reporting requirements of this section apply to the acquisition of that interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity.</p><p class="depth0">Treatment of Governmental Units</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: How does the reporting requirement apply to a governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) which lends money secured by property is subject to the reporting requirement without regard to the

requirement that the money be lent in connection with a trade or business. A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) subject to the reporting requirement must designate an officer or employee to make the return. The officer or employee appropriately designated must make the return in the form and manner prescribed by this section.</p><p class="depth0">Notification of Sale Under Section 7425(b)</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: Does a return filed as required under this section constitute a notification of sale under section 7425(b)?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: No. A return filed under this section is not considered a notification of sale under section 7425(b).</p><p class="depth0">Sale to Third Party</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: If a party other than the lender purchases property securing a loan at a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale, must the lender report under this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: Yes. The lender must report if a party other than the lender purchases property securing the lender's loan at a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale. If the proceeds of that sale are applied to satisfy all or any portion of the lender's loan, the lender must treat the property as having been abandoned. The lender will be treated as having reason to know that the property has been abandoned as of the date of the sale (see A-19). If no proceeds of such a sale are made available to satisfy any portion of the lender's loan but the lender's security interest foreclosed upon is terminated, reduced, or otherwise impaired by reason of the sale, the lender will be treated as having reason to know that the property has been abandoned as of the date of the sale (see A-19).</p><p class="depth0">Treatment of Foreign Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of foreign borrowers where the property securing the loan is located outside the United States?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: No reporting is required where both of the following requirements are met: (a) The property securing the loan is located outside the United States, and (b) at any time before the lender is required to report, the borrower furnishes the lender with a statement, signed upon penalty of perjury, that he is an exempt foreign person (unless an employee or other agent of the lender who is responsible for receiving or reviewing these statements has actual knowledge that the statement is incorrect). For purposes of this section, the borrower is an exempt foreign person if he:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is not a citizen of the United States, a resident of the United States, a person treated as a resident of the United States by reason of an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) or a United States corporation or other United States entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not subject to the provisions of section 877; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At the time the statement is furnished, is not, or reasonably expects not to be, engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the current year in connection with the loan or property securing the loan.
If, after providing the statement, the borrower ceases to be an exempt foreign person, he must so notify the lender in writing within 30 days of this change in status. If the lender is so notified, this exemption from the reporting requirement no longer applies.</p><p class="depth0">Abandonments</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: For purposes of this reporting requirement, when has an abandonment occurred?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: An abandonment has occurred when the objective facts and circumstances indicate that the borrower intended to and has permanently discarded the property from use.</p><p class="depth0">Q-18: Does the fact that a lender knows or has reason to know of an abandonment of property securing a loan mean that the borrower is entitled to an abandonment loss?</p><p class="depth0">A-18: No. The definition of an abandonment of property securing a loan in A-17 applies only for purposes of this reporting requirement and is not intended to apply for other purposes, such as determining whether a borrower would be entitled to an abandonment loss.</p><p class="depth0">Q-19: Under what circumstances will a lender be considered to have reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned?</p><p class="depth0">A-19: Whether a lender has reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned is to be determined with reference to all the facts and circumstances concerning the status of the property. When the lender in the ordinary course of business becomes aware or should become aware of circumstances indicating that the property has been abandoned, the lender will be deemed to know all the information that would have been discovered through a reasonable inquiry. For example, if a borrower has failed (without adequate explanation) to make payments on the loan for a substantial period, the lender must make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there has been an abandonment. If a reasonable inquiry would reveal objective facts and circumstances indicating that the borrower intended to and has permanently discarded the property from use, then the lender has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. If a lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence

foreclosure, execution sale, or similar proceedings, see A-20.</p><p class="depth0">Q-20: If a lender has reason to know that property that is security for a loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence within three months foreclosure, execution sale, or similar proceedings, is reporting of the abandonment required?</p><p class="depth0">A-20: In these circumstances, the lender need not report as of the date he knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. Instead, the lender must report as of the date he acquires an interest in the property or a third party purchases the property at a foreclosure, execution or similar sale (see A-10 and A-15). In any other case, the lender must report as of the date the lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned (see A-18).</p><p class="depth0">Q-21: If a lender has reason to know that property that is security for a loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence within three months foreclosure, execution sale or similar proceedings but in fact does not commence such proceedings within the three month period, must the lender report?</p><p class="depth0">A-21: Yes. In these circumstances, the lender's obligation to report the abandonment arises at the close of the three month period. For example, if on December 31, 1985, a lender first has reason to know that property securing his loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence foreclosure proceedings within three months, the lender is not required to report as of December 31, 1985 (see A-20). However, if the lender does not in fact commence foreclosure proceedings by March 31, 1986, the lender's obligation to report arises on this date. The lender must provide information on the abandonment under A-27 as of the date the lender first had reason to know of the abandonment (December 31, 1985). The lender must file the return required under this section with the Internal Revenue Service on or before February 28, 1987, and furnish a statement to the borrower on or before January 31, 1987 (see A-33 and A-40).</p><p class="depth0">Subsequent Holder of a Loan</p><p class="depth0">Q-22: To whom does the reporting requirement apply when a person lends money secured by property and subsequently transfers his interest in the indebtedness to another person?</p><p class="depth0">A-22: The subsequent holder of a loan is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report with respect to events occurring after the date he acquires the loan. This rule applies to all subsequent holders of a secured loan, including governmental units or any agencies or instrumentalities thereof. For example, if the Federal National Mortgage Association purchases real property loans from a lender, it would be subject to the reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Lenders</p><p class="depth0">Q-23: If more than one person lends money secured by the same property, and one lender forecloses upon or otherwise acquires an interest in the property, must the other lenders report under this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-23: Yes. In these circumstances, other lenders must report if they know or have reason to know that the property securing their loans is foreclosed upon or otherwise acquired by another lender and the sale or other acquisition terminates, reduces, or otherwise impairs their security interests in the property (see A-15). For example, if there is a first and second mortgage on a building, and the second mortgagee knows or has reason to know that the first mortgagee has foreclosed upon the building, the second mortgagee is subject to the reporting requirement even if no part of the indebtedness owed to him is satisfied by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. For a description of the reporting requirement applicable to the first mortgagee, see A-10 and A-15.</p><p class="depth0">Q-24: If more than one person lends money secured by property, and one lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned, must each lender report under this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-24: No. Each lender is required to report only when he knows or has reason to know that property has been abandoned (see A-19).</p><p class="depth0">Form and Manner of Return</p><p class="depth0">Form of Return</p><p class="depth0">Q-25: What form shall be used to make a return required by section 6050J?</p><p class="depth0">A-25: Except as provided in A-35, the return must be made on Forms 1096 and 1099. The person required to make the return, however, may prepare and use a form which contains provisions substantially similar with those of Forms 1096 and 1099 if the person complies with any revenue procedures relating to substitute Forms 1096 and 1099 in effect at that time.</p><p class="depth0">Information Included on Return</p><p class="depth0">Q-26: What information must be included on a return required by reason of an acquisition of an interest in property that is security for a loan?</p><p class="depth0">A-26: The following information must be included on the return:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The name and address of the borrower with respect to the secured indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The borrower's TIN, as defined in Section 7701(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A general description of the property in which an interest is acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Whether the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The date on which the person acquired an interest in the property (see A-10 or A-15);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The amount of the indebtedness outstanding at the time the interest in property is acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness, the fair market value of the property at the time the interest is acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The amount of the indebtedness satisfied by the acquisition; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any other information as may be required by Forms 1096 and 1099.</p><p class="depth0">Q-27: What information must be included on a return required because a person knows or has reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned?</p><p class="depth0">A-27: The following information must be included on the return:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The information required in A-26 (a), (b), and (d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A general description of the property abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date on which the person first knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The amount of the indebtedness outstanding as of the date on which the person first knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness, the fair market value of the property at the time of abandonment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any other information as may be required by Forms 1096 and 1099.</p><p class="depth0">Partnership Borrower</p><p class="depth0">Q-28: If a borrower is a partnership, must the TIN of each partner be reported?</p><p class="depth0">A-28: No. If a borrower is a partnership, only the TIN of the partnership must be reported.</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">Q-29: If there is more than one borrower on a single secured loan, must a person required to report under this section make a return with respect to each borrower on the loan?</p><p class="depth0">A-29: Yes. Generally, a separate return must be made with respect to each borrower on a secured loan. However, only one report is required if the lender knows that the borrowers hold property as tenants by the entirety or that the property is held as community property.</p><p class="depth0">General Description of Property</p><p class="depth0">Q-30: What type of information constitutes a general description of the property?</p><p class="depth0">A-30: A general description of the property consists of information that sufficiently identifies the property. In the case of real property, a general description consists of the property's address unless this information is not available or would not sufficiently identify the property, in which case a legal description (i.e., section, lot, block) must be provided instead. A general description of personal property consists of the type, make and model (where applicable) of the property. For example, an automobile would be described as ``Car--1983 Pontiac Firebird.'' However, in the case of a single loan secured by more than one piece of personal property, a general description consists of the type or category of the pieces acquired or abandoned. For example, if the security for a single loan is six desks and seven typewriters, a general description of the property would be ``Office Equipment.''</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Acquisitions and Abandonments</p><p class="depth0">Q-31: Must each acquisition and abandonment that occurs in a taxable year be reported on a separate return?</p><p class="depth0">A-31: Generally, each acquisition and abandonment required to be reported by a person for a taxable year must be reported on a separate return. However, in the case of a single loan secured by more than one piece of property, separate returns will not be required when a person acquires an interest in, or knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of, more than one piece of property that is security for the single loan in a taxable year. Instead, the person shall make one return for all of the acquisitions and one return for all of the abandonments of property that are security for the loan for a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Fair Market Value</p><p class="depth0">Q-32: In the case of a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale, what is the fair market value of the property for purposes of the reporting requirement?</p><p class="depth0">A-32: In general, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the proceeds of the foreclosure, execution, or similar sale will be considered the fair market value of the property for purposes of this reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Time for Filing</p><p class="depth0">Q-33: When must a person file the return or returns required by section 6050J with the Internal Revenue Service?</p><p class="depth0">A-33: The return or returns must be filed on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the acquisition of an interest in the property occurs or in which the lender knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of the property.</p><p class="depth0">Place for Filing</p><p class="depth0">Q-34: Where must the return or returns be filed?</p><p class="depth0">A-34: The return or returns must be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for the Form 1099 series.</p><p class="depth0">Use of Magnetic Media</p><p class="depth0">Q-35: What rules apply with respect to the use of magnetic media?</p><p class="depth0">A-35: Any return required under section 6050J must be filed on magnetic media to the extent required by section 6011(e). Any person not required by section 6011(e) to file returns under section 6050J on magnetic media may request permission to do so. See Sec. 1.9101 for rules relating to permission to submit information on magnetic tape or other media. If a person required to file returns on magnetic media fails to do so, the penalty under section 6652 (failure to file an information return) applies.</p><p class="depth0">Requirement of Furnishing Statements to Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">In General</p><p class="depth0">Q-36: What statements must be furnished to borrowers?</p><p class="depth0">A-36: Any person required to make an information return under section 6050J must furnish a statement to each borrower whose name is required to be set forth in a return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For the date when the statement must be furnished, see A-40.</p><p class="depth0">Q-37: Is the statement considered to be furnished to the borrower if it is mailed to the borrower at the borrower's last known address?</p><p class="depth0">A-37: Yes.</p><p class="depth0">Information Included on Statement</p><p class="depth0">Q-38: What information must be included on the statement?</p><p class="depth0">A-38: The statement must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except in the case where the return is made on behalf of a governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof), the name and address of the person required to make the information return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case where the return is made on behalf of a governmental unit or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the name and address of such unit, agency or instrumentality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The information required under A-26 or A-27, whichever is applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A legend stating that the information is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0">Copy of Form 1099 to Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">Q-39: May the requirement of furnishing a statement be met by furnishing a copy of the Form 1099 filed with respect to that borrower?</p><p class="depth0">A-39: Yes. The requirement of furnishing a statement may be met by furnishing to the borrower a copy of the Form 1099 containing the same information filed with the Service with respect to that borrower, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, provided that the form or the reasonable facsimile bears a legend stating that the information is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0">Time of Furnishing Statement</p><p class="depth0">Q-40: When is a statement required to be furnished to the borrower?</p><p class="depth0">A-40: A statement is required to be furnished to the borrower on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the acquisition or abandonment of property occurs.</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Borrowers</p><p class="depth0">Q-41: If a person required to report under this section must make an information return with respect to more than one borrower on a single loan, of an interest in the property occurs or in which the lender knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of the property.</p><p class="depth0">A-41: Yes. A separate statement must be furnished to each borrower with respect to which a separate return is required under section 6050J.</p><p class="depth0">Extensions of Time</p><p class="depth0">Q-42: Are there any circumstances under which an extension of time may be granted with respect to the requirement of furnishing statements to borrowers?</p><p class="depth0">A-42: Yes. Upon written application of the person required to report, the service center director may, for good cause shown, grant that person an additional period (not to exceed 30 days) in which to furnish statements under section 6050J with respect to any calendar year. The application for an extension must be addressed to the director of the service center with which the returns must be filed. The application must contain a concise statement of the reasons for requesting the extension in order to aid the service center director in determining the period of extension, if any, to be granted. The application must state at the top of the first page that it is made under section 1.6050J-1T and must be signed by the person required to report under section 6050J.

For purposes of section 6050K of the Code and this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 751(a) exchange. The term section 751(a) exchange means any sale or exchange of a partnership interest (or portion thereof) in which any portion of any money or other property received by a transferor partner in exchange for all or a part of his or her interest in the partnership is attributable to section 751 property. The term does not include a distribution which is treated as a sale or exchange between the distributee and the partnership under section 751(b) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 751 property. The term section 751 property means unrealized receivables, as defined in section 751(c) of the Code, and inventory items which have appreciated substantially in value (``substantially appreciated inventory items''), as defined in section 751(d) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transferor and transferee. The term transferor means the beneficial owner of a partnership interest immediately before the transfer of that interest. The term ``transferee'' means the beneficial owner of a partnership interest immediately after the transfer of that interest. However, if a partnership does not know the identity of the beneficial owner of an interest in the partnership, the record holder of such interest shall be treated as the transferor or transferee (as the case may be) for purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contents of return.

The partnership shall use a copy of the completed Form 8308 as a statement unless the Form 8308 contains information with respect to more than one section 751(a) exchange (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section). If the partnership does not use a copy of Form 8308 as a statement, the statement shall include the information required to be shown on Form 8308 with respect to the section 751(a) exchange to which the person to whom the statement is furnished is a party.

The transferor of any partnership interest in a section 751(a) exchange shall notify the partnership of such exchange in writing within 30 days of the exchange (or, if earlier, January 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the exchange occurred). The written notification from the transferor shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The transferor of any partnership interest in a section 751(a) exchange shall notify the partnership of such exchange in writing within 30 days of the exchange (or, if earlier, January 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the exchange occurred). The written notification from the transferor shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The names and addresses of the transferor and transferee in the section 751(a) exchange;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer identification numbers of the transferor and, if known, of the transferee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date of the exchange.

Any transferor who notified a partnership under section 6050K(c)(1) prior to January 22, 1986 by a notification that does not meet the requirements of this paragraph (d) shall furnish such partnership with the written notification described in this paragraph (d) on or before February 21, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Return required under section 6045. No transferor shall be required to notify a partnership of the sale or exchange of a partnership interest under section 6050K(c)(1) or paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a return is required to be filed under section 6045 with respect to such sale or exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Partnership not required to make a return or furnish statements under this section until it has notice of the exchange. A partnership shall not be required to make a return or furnish statements under section 6050K and this section with respect to any section 751(a) exchange until it has been notified of the exchange. For purposes of section 6050K(c)(2) and this section, a partnership is notified of a section 751(a) exchange when either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The partnership receives the written notification from the transferor required under paragraph (d) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The partnership has knowledge that there has been a transfer of a partnership interest or any portion thereof, and, at the time of the transfer, the partnership had any section 751 property. However, no return or statements are required under section 6050K if the transfer was not a section 751(a) exchange (e.g., a transfer which in its entirety constitutes a gift for federal income tax purposes).

An identifiable event is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A discharge of indebtedness under title 11 of the United States Code (bankruptcy);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness that renders a debt unenforceable in a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a federal or State court, as described in section 368(a)(3)(A)(ii) (other than a discharge described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for collection of an indebtedness, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, or upon the expiration of a statutory period for filing a claim or commencing a deficiency judgment proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness pursuant to an election of foreclosure remedies by a creditor that statutorily extinguishes or bars the creditor's right to pursue collection of the indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness that renders a debt unenforceable pursuant to a probate or similar proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A discharge of indebtedness pursuant to an agreement between an applicable entity and a debtor to discharge indebtedness at less than full consideration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A discharge of indebtedness pursuant to a decision by the creditor, or the application of a defined policy of the creditor, to discontinue collection activity and discharge debt; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> In the case of an entity described in section 6050P(c)(2)(A) through (C), the expiration of the non-payment testing period, as described in Sec. 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statute of limitations. In the case of an expiration of the statute of limitations for collection of an indebtedness, an identifiable event occurs under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section only if, and at such time as, a debtor's affirmative statute of limitations defense is upheld in a final judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding, and the period for appealing the judgment or decision has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Decision to discontinue collection activity; creditor's defined policy. For purposes of the identifiable event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(G) of this section, a creditor's defined policy includes both a written policy of the creditor and the creditor's established business practice. Thus, for example, a creditor's established practice to discontinue collection activity and abandon debts upon expiration of a particular non-payment period is considered a defined policy for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(G) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Expiration of non-payment testing period. There is a rebuttable presumption that an identifiable event under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(H) of this section has occurred during a calendar year if a creditor has not received a payment on an indebtedness at any time during a testing period (as defined in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)) ending at the close of the year. The testing period is a 36-month period increased by the number of calendar months during all or part of which the creditor was precluded from engaging in collection activity by a stay in bankruptcy or similar bar under state or local law. The presumption that an identifiable event has occurred may be rebutted by the creditor if the creditor (or a third-party collection agency on behalf of the creditor) has engaged in significant, bona fide collection activity at any time during the 12-month period ending at the close of the calendar year, or if facts and circumstances existing as of January 31 of the calendar year following expiration of the 36-month period indicate that the indebtedness has not been discharged. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Significant, bona fide collection activity does not include merely nominal or ministerial collection action, such as an automated mailing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Facts and circumstances indicating that an indebtedness has not been discharged include the existence of a lien relating to the indebtedness against the debtor (to the extent of the value of the security), or the sale or packaging for sale of the indebtedness by the creditor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In no event will an identifiable event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(H) of this section occur prior to December 31, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rule for certain entities required to file in a year prior to 2008. In the case of an entity described in section 6050P(c)(1)(A) or (c)(2)(D) required to file an information return in a tax year prior to 2008 due to an identifiable event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(H) of this section, and who failed to so file, the date of discharge is the first event, if any, described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (G) of this section that occurs after 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Permitted reporting. If a discharge of indebtedness occurs before the date on which an identifiable event occurs, the discharge may, at the creditor's discretion, be reported under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Indebtedness. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.6050P-2, indebtedness means any amount owed to an applicable entity, including stated principal, fees, stated interest, penalties, administrative costs and fines. The amount of indebtedness discharged may represent all, or only a part, of the total amount owed to the applicable entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions from reporting requirement--(1) Certain bankruptcy discharges--(i) In general. Reporting is required under this section in the case of a discharge of indebtedness in bankruptcy only if the creditor knows from information included in the reporting entity's books and records pertaining to the indebtedness that the debt was incurred for business or investment purposes as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain bankruptcy discharges--(i) In general.

Reporting is required under this section in the case of a discharge of indebtedness in bankruptcy only if the creditor knows from information included in the reporting entity's books and records pertaining to the indebtedness that the debt was incurred for business or investment purposes as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Business or investment debt. Indebtedness is considered incurred for business purposes if it is incurred in connection with the conduct of any trade or business other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Indebtedness is considered incurred for investment purposes if it

is incurred to purchase property held for investment, as defined in section 163(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest. The discharge of an amount of indebtedness that is interest is not required to be reported under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-principal amounts in lending transactions. In the case of a lending transaction, the discharge of an amount other than stated principal is not required to be reported under this section. For this purpose, a lending transaction is any transaction in which a lender loans money to, or makes advances on behalf of, a borrower (including revolving credits and lines of credit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indebtedness of foreign debtors held by foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions--(i) Reporting requirements. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reporting requirements. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition. An indebtedness held by a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution is described in this paragraph (d)(4) only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The financial institution is engaged through a branch or office in the active conduct of a banking or similar business outside the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The branch or office is a permanent place of business that is regularly maintained, occupied, and used to carry on a banking or similar financial business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The business is conducted by at least one employee of the branch or office who is regularly in attendance at such place of business during normal working hours;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The indebtedness is extended outside of the United States by the branch or office in connection with that trade or business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The financial institution does not know or have reason to know that the debtor is a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Acquisition of indebtedness by related party. No reporting is required under this section in the case of a deemed discharge of indebtedness under section 108(e)(4) (relating to the acquisition of an indebtedness by a person related to the debtor), unless the disposition of the indebtedness by the creditor was made with a view to avoiding the reporting requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Releases. The release of a co-obligor is not required to be reported under this section if the remaining debtors remain liable for the full amount of any unpaid indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Guarantors and sureties. Solely for purposes of the reporting requirements of this section, a guarantor is not a debtor. Thus, in the case of guaranteed indebtedness, reporting under this section is not required with respect to a guarantor, whether or not there has been a default and demand for payment made upon the guarantor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional rules--(1) Multiple debtors--(i) In general. In the case of indebtedness of $10,000 or more incurred on or after January 1, 1995, that involves more than one debtor, a reporting entity is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for each debtor discharged from such indebtedness. In the case of indebtedness incurred prior to January 1, 1995, and indebtedness of less than $10,000 incurred on or after January 1, 1995, involving multiple debtors, reporting under this section is required only with respect to the primary (or first-named) debtor. Additionally, only one return of information is required under this section if the reporting entity knows, or has reason to know, that co-obligors were husband and wife living at the same address when an indebtedness was incurred, and does not know or have reason to know that such circumstances have changed at the date of a discharge of the indebtedness. This paragraph (e)(1) applies to discharges of indebtedness after December 31, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiple debtors--(i) In general. In the case of indebtedness of $10,000 or more incurred on or after January 1, 1995, that involves more than one debtor, a reporting entity is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for each debtor discharged from such indebtedness. In the case of indebtedness incurred prior to January 1, 1995, and indebtedness of less than $10,000 incurred on or after January 1, 1995, involving multiple debtors, reporting under this section is required only with respect to the primary (or first-named) debtor. Additionally, only one return of information is required under this section if the reporting entity knows, or has reason to know, that co-obligors were husband and wife living at the same address when an indebtedness was incurred, and does not know or have reason to know that such circumstances have changed at the date of a discharge of the indebtedness.

In the case of indebtedness of $10,000 or more incurred on or after January 1, 1995, that involves more than one debtor, a reporting entity is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for each debtor discharged from such indebtedness. In the case of indebtedness incurred prior to January 1, 1995, and indebtedness of less than $10,000 incurred on or after January 1, 1995, involving multiple debtors, reporting under this section is required only with respect to the primary (or first-named) debtor.

This paragraph (e)(1) applies to discharges of indebtedness after December 31, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount to be reported. In the case of multiple debtors jointly and severally liable on an indebtedness, the amount of discharged indebtedness required to be reported under this section with respect to each debtor is the total amount of indebtedness discharged. For this purpose, multiple debtors are presumed to be jointly and severally liable on an indebtedness in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiple creditors--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(2), if indebtedness is owned (or treated as owned for federal income tax purposes) by more than one

creditor, each creditor that is an applicable entity must comply with the reporting requirements of this section with respect to any discharge of indebtedness of $600 or more allocable to such creditor. A creditor will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this section if a lead bank, fund administrator, or other designee of the creditor complies on its behalf in any reasonable manner, such as by filing a single return reporting the aggregate amount of indebtedness discharged, or by filing a return with respect to the portion of the discharged indebtedness allocable to the creditor.

[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reporting requirements. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a pass-through securitized indebtedness arrangement is any arrangement whereby one or more debt obligations are pooled and held for twenty or more persons whose interests in the debt obligations are undivided co-ownership interests that are freely transferrable. Co-ownership interests that are actively traded personal property (as defined in Sec. 1.1092(d)-1) are presumed to be freely transferrable and held by twenty or more persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> REMICs.

If multiple creditors are considered to hold interests in an indebtedness for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2) by virtue of holding ownership interests in an entity, and the entity is required to report a discharge of that indebtedness under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, then the multiple creditors are not required to report the discharge of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with reporting under section 6050J. If, in the same calendar year, a discharge of indebtedness reportable under section 6050P occurs in connection with a transaction also reportable under section 6050J (relating to foreclosures and abandonments of secured property), an applicable entity need not file both a Form 1099-A and a Form 1099-C with respect to the same debtor. The filing requirements of section 6050J will be satisfied with respect to a borrower if, in lieu of filing Form 1099-A, a Form 1099-C is filed in accordance with the instructions for the filing of that form. This paragraph (e)(3) applies to discharges of indebtedness after December 31, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Direct or indirect subsidiary.

Notwithstanding Sec. 1.6050P-2(b)(3), if an entity (the transferee entity) is formed or availed of by an applicable entity (within the meaning of section 6050P(c)(1)) for the principal purpose of holding indebtedness acquired (including originated) by the applicable entity, then, for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), the transferee entity has a significant trade or business of lending money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use of magnetic media. Any return required under this section must be filed on magnetic media to the extent required by section 6011(e) and the regulations thereunder. A failure to file on magnetic media when required constitutes a failure to file an information return under section 6721. Any person not required by section 6011(e) to file returns on magnetic media may request permission to do so under applicable regulations and revenue procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> TIN solicitation requirement--(i) In general. For purposes of reporting under this section, a reasonable effort must be made to obtain the correct name/taxpayer identification number (TIN) combination of a person whose indebtedness is discharged. A TIN obtained at the time an indebtedness is incurred satisfies the requirement of

this section, unless the entity required to file knows that such TIN is incorrect. If the TIN is not obtained prior to the occurrence of an identifiable event, it must be requested of the debtor for purposes of satisfying the requirement of this paragraph (e)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Solicitations made in the manner described in Sec. 301.6724-1(e)(1)(i) and (2) of this chapter will be deemed to have satisfied the reasonable effort requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. A TIN solicitation made after the occurrence of an identifiable event must clearly notify the debtor that the Internal Revenue Service requires the debtor to furnish its TIN, and that failure to furnish such TIN may subject the debtor to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. A TIN provided under this section is not required to be certified under penalties of perjury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. Any applicable entity required to file a return with the Internal Revenue Service under this section must also retain a copy of the return, or have the ability to reconstruct the data required to be included on the return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for at least four years from the date such return is required to be filed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> No multiple reporting.

Sec. 1.6050P-2  Organization a significant trade or business of which is the lending of money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), the lending of money is

a significant trade or business of an organization in a calendar year if the organization lends money on a regular and continuing basis during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Safe harbors--(1) Organizations not subject to section 6050P in the previous calendar year. For an organization that was not required to report under section 6050P in the previous calendar year, the lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if gross income from lending money (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) in the organization's most recent test year (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) is both less than $5 million and less than 15 percent of the organization's gross income for that test year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Organizations not subject to section 6050P in the previous calendar year. For an organization that was not required to report under section 6050P in the previous calendar year, the lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if gross income from lending money (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) in the organization's most recent test year (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) is both less than $5 million and less than 15 percent of the organization's gross income for that test year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Organizations that were subject to section 6050P in the previous calendar year. For an organization that was required to report under section 6050P for the previous calendar year, the lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if gross income from lending money (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) in each of the organization's three most recent test years is both less than $3 million and less than 10 percent of the organization's gross income for that test year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No test year. The lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for an organization for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if the organization does not have a test year for that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Seller financing. If the principal trade or business of an organization is selling nonfinancial goods or providing nonfinancial services and if the organization extends credit to the purchasers of those goods or services to finance the purchases, then, for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), these extensions of credit are not a significant trade or business of lending money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gross income from lending of money. For purposes of this section, gross income from lending of money includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income from interest, including qualified stated interest, original issue discount, and market discount;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gains arising from the sale or other disposition of indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Penalties with respect to indebtedness (whether or not the penalty is interest for Federal tax purposes); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees with respect to indebtedness, including merchant discount or interchange (whether or not the fee is interest for Federal tax purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acquisition of an indebtedness from a person other than the debtor included in lending money. For purposes of this section, lending money includes acquiring an indebtedness not only from the debtor at origination but also from a prior holder of the indebtedness. Gross income arising from indebtedness is gross income from the lending of money without regard to who originated the indebtedness. If an organization acquires an indebtedness, the organization is required to report any cancellation of the indebtedness if the organization is engaged in a significant trade or business of lending money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Test year. For any calendar year, a test year is a taxable year of the organization that ends before July 1 of the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Predecessor organization. If an organization acquires substantially all of the property that was used in a trade or business of some other organization (the predecessor) (including when two or more corporations are parties to a merger agreement under which the surviving corporation becomes the owner of the assets and assumes the liabilities of the absorbed corporation(s)) or was used in a separate unit of the predecessor, then whether the organization at issue qualifies for one of the safe harbors in paragraph (b) of this section is determined by also taking into account the test years, reporting obligations, and gross income of the predecessor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Finance Company A, a calendar year taxpayer, was formed in Year 1 as a non-bank subsidiary of Manufacturing Company and has no predecessor. A lends money to purchasers of Manufacturing Company's products on a regular and continuing basis to finance the purchase of those products. A's gross income from stated interest in Year 1 is $4.7 million. In Year 1, A's gross income from fees and penalties with respect

to the indebtedness is $0.5 million, and A has no other gross income from lending money within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results. Section 6050P does not require A to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Years 1 or 2, because A has no test year for those years. Notwithstanding that A lends money in those years on a regular and continuing basis, under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, A does not have a significant trade or business of lending money in those years for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D). However, for Year 3, A's test year is Year 1. A's gross income from lending in Year 1 is not less than $5 million for purposes of the applicable safe harbor of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Because A lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor, section 6050P requires A to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A is a division of Manufacturing Company, rather than a separate subsidiary. Manufacturing Company's principal activity is the manufacture and sale of non-financial products, and, other than financing the purchase of those products, Manufacturing Company does not extend credit or otherwise lend money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results. Under paragraph (c) of this section, that financing activity is not a significant trade or business of lending money for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), and section 6050P does not require Manufacturing Company to report discharges of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Company B, a calendar year taxpayer, is formed in Year 1. B has no predecessor and a part of its activities consists of the lending of money. B packages and sells part of the indebtedness it originates and holds the remainder. B is engaged in these activities on a regular and continuing basis. For Year 1, the sum of B's gross income from sales of the indebtedness, plus other income described in paragraph (d) of this section, is only $4.8 million, but it is 16% of B's gross income in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results. Because B lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, section 6050P requires B to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3. B is not required to report discharges of indebtedness in Years 1 and 2 because B has no test year for Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3. In addition, in each of Years 2, 3, and 4, the sum of B's gross income from sales of the indebtedness, plus other income described in paragraph (d) of this section, is less than both $3 million and 10% of B's gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results. (A) Because B was required to report under section 6050P for Year 3, the applicable safe harbor for Year 4 is paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which is satisfied only if B's gross income from lending activities for each of the three most recent test years is less than both $3 million and 10% of B's gross income. For Year 4, even though B has only two test years, B's gross income in one of those test years, Year 1, causes B to fail to meet this safe harbor. Accordingly, B is required to report discharges of indebtedness under section 6050P in Year 4. For Year 5, B's three most recent test years are Years 1, 2, and 3. However, B's gross income from lending activities in Year 1 is not less than $3 million and 10% of B's gross income. Accordingly, section 6050P requires B to report discharges of indebtedness in Year 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Because B was required to report under section 6050P for Year 3, the applicable safe harbor for Year 4 is paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which is satisfied only if B's gross income from lending activities for each of the three most recent test years is less than both $3 million and 10% of B's gross income.

Therefore, section 6050P does not require B to report discharges of indebtedness in Year 6. Because B is not required to report for Year 6, the applicable safe harbor for Year 7 is the one contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and thus the only relevant test year is Year 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. (A) Company C, a calendar year taxpayer, was formed in Year 1 and, on a regular and continuing basis, enters into the following transactions with its clients, all of whom are unrelated parties to C. C does not have any other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Company C, a calendar year taxpayer, was formed in Year 1 and, on a regular and continuing basis, enters into the following transactions with its clients, all of whom are unrelated parties to C. C does not have any other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> C's clients sell goods to customers, frequently accepting as payment accounts receivable that are due in 30 to 90 days. Under a contract with each client, C investigates the creditworthiness of the client's customers with respect to the prospective sales, and, for each customer, C determines whether, and to what extent, C is willing to assume the risk of loss on accounts receivable to be issued by the customer. C's decision whether to assume risk of loss may be based on an evaluation of the credit quality of particular customers or on the aggregate credit quality of all of the client's prospective customers. If C is unwilling to assume the risk, the client either may refuse to extend any credit to the customer or may accept the account receivable and bear the risk of loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pursuant to some contracts between C's clients and C, C's clients assign legal title to the accounts receivable to C when the accounts receivable are issued by the customers. For these accounts receivable, C agrees to undertake collections and to remit the amounts collected to the client, less a fee of 0.70 percent of the face value of the accounts receivable. Pursuant to other contracts between C's clients and C, C's clients retain legal title to the accounts receivable and retain the initial collection responsibility. For these accounts receivable, C's fee is reduced to 0.35 percent. Both groups of accounts receivable include accounts receivable for which C has assumed the risk of loss

and accounts receivable for which C has not assumed the risk of loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Based on all the facts and circumstances, C acquires ownership for Federal tax purposes of some, but not all, of the accounts receivable that it has agreed to collect and of some, but not all, of the accounts receivable for which the client has retained collection responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In Year 1, C's total fee income with respect to accounts receivable of which it acquired tax ownership was $2 million. C's fee income in Year 1 from accounts receivable of which it did not acquire tax ownership was $700,000. C does not have any other income for Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In Year 3, there were discharges of $950,000, representing $100,000 of customer defaults on those accounts receivable of which C was the owner for Federal tax purposes at the time of the identifiable event marking the discharge and $850,000 of customer defaults on the accounts receivable of which the clients, and not C, were the owner. Whenever C determined the uncollectibility of an account receivable for which it had not assumed the risk of loss, C reassigned title to the account receivable to the appropriate client. Each defaulting customer defaulted on an account receivable with an outstanding balance of at least $600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Results. (A) For Year 3, C's test year is Year 1. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $2 million fee income from the accounts receivable of which it acquired tax ownership is ``gross income from lending money'' for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was the owner of the accounts for Federal tax purposes. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $700,000 fee income from the accounts receivable of which it did not acquire tax ownership is not ``gross income from lending money'' for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was not the owner of the accounts receivable for Federal tax purposes. In Year 1, therefore, C's gross income from lending money is less than $5 million but is not less than 15% of C's gross income. Because C lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor, section 6050P requires C to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For Year 3, C's test year is Year 1. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $2 million fee income from the accounts receivable of which it acquired tax ownership is ``gross income from lending money'' for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was the owner of the accounts for Federal tax purposes. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $700,000 fee income from the accounts receivable of which it did not acquire tax ownership is not ``gross income from lending money'' for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was not the owner of the accounts receivable for Federal tax purposes. In Year 1, therefore, C's gross income from lending money is less than $5 million but is not less than 15% of C's gross income. Because C lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor, section 6050P requires C to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In Year 3, section 6050P requires C to report the $100,000 of discharges of the accounts receivable of which C was the owner for Federal tax purposes at the time of the identifiable event marking the discharge. Unless an exception to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section applies, section 6050P requires C's clients to report the $850,000 of discharges of the accounts receivable of which C did not become the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective date. This section applies to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or after January 1, 2005.

In late September 2003, University X credits $5,000 to Student A's account, reflecting a $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and

related expenses. In late September 2003, University X applies the $5,000 positive account balance toward current charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $11,000 payment is treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, the $5,000 credited to the student's account is treated as a reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses, because the current year charges for qualified tuition and related expenses were reduced by $5,000. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, University X is required to net the $10,000 payment received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003 against the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.

Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, University X is required to net the $10,000 payment received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003 against the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003. Therefore, Institution X is required to report $5,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Student A is enrolled full-time, and, in early September 2003, Student A decides to live at home with her parents.

In mid-January 2004, College Y credits Student B's account with $5,000, reflecting a $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses, but does not issue a refund to Student B. In early August 2004, College Y bills Student B $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2004 Fall semester. In early September 2004, College Y applies the $5,000 positive account balance toward Student B's $16,000 bill for the 2004 Fall semester.

Under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of qualified tuition and related expenses must be separately reported on Form 1098-T because it relates to payments of qualified tuition and related expenses reported by College Y for 2003. Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $5,000 positive account balance that is applied toward charges for the 2004 Fall semester is treated as a payment. Therefore, College Y received total payments of $11,000 during 2004 (the $5,000 credit plus the $6,000 payment). Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $11,000 of total payments are treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for such expenses. Therefore, for 2004, College Y

However, the institution or insurer must establish that it acted in a responsible manner both before and after the failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a failure to include a correct TIN on Form 1098-T or a related information statement, penalties may be waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause. Reasonable cause may be established if the failure arose from events beyond the institution's or insurer's control, such as a failure of the individual to furnish a correct TIN. However, the institution or insurer must establish that it acted in a responsible manner both before and after the failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acting in a responsible manner. An institution or insurer must request the TIN of each individual for whom it is required to file a return if it does not already have a record of the individual's correct TIN. If the institution or insurer does not have a record of the individual's correct TIN, then it must solicit the TIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section on or before December 31 of each year during which it receives payments, or bills amounts, for qualified tuition and related expenses or makes reimbursements, refunds, or reductions of such amounts with respect to the individual. If an individual refuses to provide his or her TIN upon request, the institution or insurer must file the return and furnish the statement required by this section without the individual's TIN, but with all other required information. The specific solicitation requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section apply in lieu of the solicitation requirements of Sec. 301.6724-1(e) and (f) of this chapter for the purpose of determining whether an institution or insurer acted in a responsible manner in attempting to obtain a correct TIN. An institution or insurer that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3) will be considered to have acted in a responsible manner within the meaning of Sec. 301.6724-1(d) of this chapter with respect to any failure to include the correct TIN of an individual on a return or statement required by section 6050S and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manner of soliciting TIN. An institution or insurer must request the individual's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the individual that the law requires the individual to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the institution or insurer. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, ``Request for Student's or Borrower's Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,'' satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii). An institution or insurer may establish a system for individuals to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. An institution or insurer may also develop a separate form to request the individual's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the institution or insurer, such as admission or enrollment forms or financial aid applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to furnish TIN. The section 6723 penalty may apply to any individual who is required (but fails) to furnish his or her TIN to an institution or insurer. See section 6723, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to the penalty for failure to furnish a TIN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. The rules in this section apply to information returns required to be filed, and information statements required to be furnished, after December 31, 2003. Paragraph (c)(1)(i) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, Sec. 1.6050S-1 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

In the case of a failure to include a correct TIN on Form 1098-E or a related information statement, penalties may be waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause. Reasonable cause may be established if the failure arose from events beyond the payee's control, such as a failure of the payor to furnish a correct TIN. However, the payee must establish that it acted in a responsible manner both before and after the failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acting in a responsible manner. A payee must request the TIN of each

payor if it does not already have a record of the payor's correct TIN. If the payee does not have a record of the payor's correct TIN, then it must solicit the TIN in the manner described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section on or before December 31 of each year during which it receives payments of interest. If a payor refuses to provide his or her TIN upon request, the payee must file the return and furnish the statement required by this section without the payor's TIN, but with all other required information. The specific solicitation requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section apply in lieu of the solicitation requirements of Sec. 301.6724-1(e) and (f) of this chapter for the purpose of determining whether a payee acted in a responsible manner in attempting to obtain a correct TIN. A payee that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3) will be considered to have acted in a responsible manner within the meaning of Sec. 301.6724-1(d) of this chapter with respect to any failure to include the correct TIN of a payor on a return or statement required by section 6050S and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Manner of soliciting TIN. A payee must request the payor's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the payor that the law requires the payor to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the payee. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, ``Request for Student's or Borrower's Social Security Number and Certification,'' satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(iii). A payee may establish a system for payors to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. A payee may also develop a separate form to request the payor's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the payee, such as loan applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to furnish TIN. The section 6723 penalty may apply to any payor who is required (but fails) to furnish his or her TIN to a payee. See section 6723, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to the penalty for failure to furnish a TIN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. The rules of this section apply to information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished after December 31, 2014. For information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished before January 1, 2015, Sec. 1.6050S-3 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

The facilitator need not have any agreement or arrangement with the participating payee. Also, the payment need not come from the facilitator's account.

Thus, notwithstanding the rule in paragraph (d)(2) of this section imposing the obligation to file the annual information return on the electronic payment facilitator in lieu of the payment settlement entity, the payment settlement entity may file the information return by designation

if the parties agree in writing. However, a designation does not relieve the party with the reporting obligation from liability for any reporting failures. The party with the obligation to file the annual information return under this section remains liable for any applicable penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 if the requirements of this section are not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency. When a payment is made or received in a foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount shall be determined by converting such foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of the transaction at the spot rate (as defined in Sec. 1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. For example, a payor may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts reported and from year to year. Such convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner or his or her delegate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unrelated persons. For purposes of this section, unrelated means any person who is not related to another person within the meaning of section 267(b) (providing a list of relationships), including the application of section 267(c) and (e)(3) (providing rules relating to constructive ownership), and section 707(b)(1) (relationships with partnerships).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Merchant acquiring entity. Customer A purchases goods from merchant B using a credit card issued by Bank X. B is one of a network of unrelated persons that has agreed to accept credit cards issued by X as payment under an agreement that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transaction between a merchant acquiring bank and the persons who accept the cards. Bank Z is the merchant acquiring bank with the contractual obligation to make payment to B for goods provided to A in this transaction. As defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Z is the merchant acquiring entity that must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report the payment made to settle the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Merchant B is one of a substantial number of persons selling goods or services over the Internet that have an account with X, an Internet payment service provider. None of these persons, including B, are related to X, and all have agreed to settle transactions for the sale of goods or services to customers according to the terms of their contracts with X. X has guaranteed payment to all of these persons, including B, for the sale of goods or services to customers. Customer A purchases goods from B. A pays X for the goods purchased from B. X, in turn, makes payment to B in settlement of the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X's arrangement constitutes a third party payment network as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section because a substantial number of persons that are unrelated to X, including B, have established accounts with X, and X is contractually obligated to settle transactions for the provision of goods or services by these persons to purchasers. Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, X is a third party settlement organization and the transaction discussed in this Example is a third party network transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Therefore, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report the payment made to B in settlement of the transaction with A provided that X's aggregate payments to B from third party network transactions exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of X's transactions with B exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Automated clearinghouse network. A operates an automated clearinghouse (``ACH'') network that merely processes electronic payments (such as wire transfers, electronic checks, and direct deposit payments) between buyers and sellers. There are no contractual agreements between A and the sellers for the purpose of permitting the sellers to use the ACH network. Thus, A is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the ACH network is not a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and the electronic payment transactions are not third party network transactions under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A is not required to file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. ACH processor. B provides a variety of ACH payment processing services to a large number of merchants, such as converting checks received in payment of bills into ACH transactions. B groups payment transactions into an ACH file and transmits the ACH file into the ACH network on behalf of merchants in order to initiate payment to merchants through the ACH network. B makes payments to the merchants after the

ACH network verifies that the customers' accounts have sufficient funds. Because the ACH network is not a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, B cannot be a third party settlement organization with respect to the ACH network. Similarly, because the ACH itself is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, B cannot be an electronic payment facilitator because B is not acting on behalf of a payment settlement entity. However, B may itself be operating third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section if B has a separate agreement or arrangement that: involves the establishment of accounts with B by a substantial number of unrelated merchants who provide goods or services and have agreed to settle transactions for the provision of the goods or services pursuant to the agreement or arrangement; provides for standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions; and guarantees persons providing goods or services pursuant to such agreement or arrangement that these persons will be paid for providing such goods or services.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Gross amount. On Day 1, Customer A uses a payment card to purchase $100 worth of goods from merchant B. Bank X, the merchant acquiring entity for B, is the party with the contractual obligation to make payment to B in settlement of the transaction. On Day 2, X, after deducting fees of $2, makes payment of $98 to settle the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A. Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, X must report the amount of $100, the amount of the transaction on Day 1, without any reduction for fees or any other amount, as the gross amount of this reportable payment transaction on the annual information return filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Customer A purchases a gift card from Merchant X that may be used only at X and its related network of stores. A purchases the gift card using cash. A gives the gift card to B. B uses the gift card to purchase goods at one of X's stores. The purchase of the gift card by A using cash is not a payment card transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and, thus, is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the gift card is not a payment card because the gift card is only accepted as payment by persons who are related to the issuer of the gift card and to each other. Therefore, the use of the gift card by B is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i), except that B adds value to the gift card using a credit card. The use of the credit card to add value to the gift card is a reportable payment transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and must be reported in a return of information under this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to X in settlement of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Private label card. Bank B issues a card imprinted with Retailer C's logo to cardholder A. The ``C-card'' is accepted as payment only at C or at stores related (within the meaning of section 267(b), (c) and (e)(3) and, section 707(b)(1)) to C. A uses the card at C to purchase electronics equipment. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the C-card is not a payment card because the card is accepted as payment only within a network of persons who are related to each other. Therefore, the use of the card by A at C is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Quasi-private label card. Bank B issues a card to cardholder A. The card, known as an ``E-card,'' is issued by B pursuant to an agreement that provides that the E-card is accepted as payment only within a limited network of merchants that carry electronics equipment. The agreement provides for standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions between the merchants and the merchant acquiring entities. The merchants accepting the E-card as payment are not related (within the meaning of section 267(b), (c) and (e)(3) and section 707(b)(1)) to each other or to B. A uses the card to purchase electronics equipment at F Store, one of the stores within the network of merchants accepting the E-card. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the E-card is a payment card because the card is issued pursuant to an agreement that provides for a network of persons unrelated to each other, and to the issuer, who agree to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the E-card by A to purchase electronics equipment at F Store must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> University Y issues Student A a card that may be used on campus at various university-owned merchants and at various local merchants unrelated to Y. A uses the card in the university-owned cafeteria to purchase lunch. Under paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, no return of information is required because the card is being accepted as payment by a person who is related to the issuer of the card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i), except that A uses the campus card to purchase lunch at a local restaurant, unrelated to Y, that has agreed to accept the campus card as payment. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the campus card is a payment card in this transaction because the

card is accepted as payment by a person that is unrelated to this issuer of the card pursuant to an agreement. Therefore, the use of the card by A in the local restaurant for the purchase of lunch must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to the restaurant in settlement of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Mall card. Customer B purchases a card that is issued by shopping mall A. Pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, the card is accepted as payment by various merchants located within the mall, who are unrelated to the issuer of the card and to each other. B uses the card in the mall to purchase goods from merchant C. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the mall card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a network of persons who are unrelated to the issuer of the card and to the other merchants who have agreed to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the mall card by B to purchase goods from merchant C is required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Electronic benefit transactions card. Government Agency A issues benefits electronically to recipients by loading these benefits onto a payment card. Pursuant to an agreement, a network of merchants unrelated to A, and to each other, has agreed to accept the benefits card as payment. A issues a card to B, who uses the card to purchase goods from Merchant C. The card issued by A is a payment card (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) because the card is accepted as payment by a network of persons that are unrelated to the issuer of the card, and to each other.</p><p class="depth0">The use of the card by B to purchase goods from C must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Prepaid telephone card. A purchases a prepaid telephone card from Company X that may be used to make telephone calls using various long-distance providers unrelated to X that have agreed to accept the card as payment. A places a telephone call using the prepaid card as payment for the telephone call. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the prepaid telephone card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a person that is unrelated to the issuer of the card pursuant to an agreement. Therefore, the use of the prepaid card to make payment for the telephone call must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to the long distance provider in settlement of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Transit card. City Z accepts a transit card as payment for use of its mass transit system. The transit card is issued by B, an organization unrelated to Z. A network of persons, including Z, who are unrelated to each other and to B, have agreed to accept the transit card issued by B as payment for transit and for other goods and services. Transit rider X purchases a transit card and uses the card to pay for travel on Z's mass transit system. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the transit card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a person who is one of a network of persons that are unrelated to the issuer of the card, and to each other, and that have agreed to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the transit card by X to pay for transit on Z's mass transit system is a payment card transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to Z. Z is the participating payee, described in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section, of the payment card transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. Cash advance. Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. B uses the card at a local bank to obtain a cash advance. Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, B's use of the payment card to obtain a cash advance is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the card is not being accepted as payment by a merchant.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Withdrawals from automated teller machines. Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. B uses the card at an automated teller machine to obtain cash. Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, B's use of the payment card to obtain cash is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the card is not being accepted as payment by a merchant.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. Convenience checks. Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A sends B paper checks imprinted with the account number associated with the credit card. B uses one of the checks to purchase goods from Merchant S. The check is accepted by S and processed through the bank system in the same manner as a traditional check. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, B's use of the convenience check to purchase goods is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the check is accepted and processed as a traditional check, not as a payment card.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. Healthcare network. Health carrier A operates healthcare network Y. A collects premiums from covered persons pursuant to a plan agreement between A and the covered persons for the cost of membership in Y. Separately, A pays healthcare providers pursuant to provider agreements to compensate these providers for services rendered to covered persons who are members of Y. A is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because A does not operate a third party payment network that enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers of goods and services. Therefore, A is not required to file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. Third party accounts payable. X is a ``shared-service'' organization that performs accounts payable services for numerous purchasers that are unrelated to X. A substantial number of providers of goods and services have established accounts with X and have agreed to accept payment from X in settlement of their transactions with purchasers. The provider agreement with X includes standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions and guarantees payment to the providers, and the arrangement enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X's accounts payable services constitute a third party payment network, of which X is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by X in settlement of accounts payable to that payee if X's aggregate payments to that payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. Toll collection network. State A charges a toll to vehicles that travel its state highways. The tolling agency for A contracted with organization X to perform its toll collection. X provides an electronic toll collection system that allows the toll facility to record the passage of a vehicle with a transponder affixed to the vehicle. The customer account associated with the transponder is automatically debited for the amount of the toll. The customer funds a balance in the account, which is then depleted as the toll transactions occur. X periodically bills the customer to replenish the account. X then makes payment to A to settle the toll transactions that are recorded by the transponder. X also contracts with a substantial number of other entities unrelated to X that have established accounts with X and have agreed to accept payment using the electronic toll collection system provided by X. X guarantees payment to the entities for all toll transactions that are recorded by the transponders, and the arrangement enables customers to transfer funds to State A and other entities that charge tolls. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X's electronic toll collection system constitutes a third party payment network, of which X is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, including A, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by X in settlement of toll transactions if X's aggregate payments to that payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 20. Hotel kiosk.

Customers settle their room account with B when they check out, and B in turn settles the hotel kiosk transactions with the unrelated sellers. B guarantees payment to the sellers for these transactions and the arrangement enables customers to transfer funds to the sellers by means of one payment made to the hotel. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, B's hotel kiosk system constitutes a third party payment network, of which B is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, B must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by B in settlement of the hotel kiosk transactions if B's aggregate payments to that payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 21.
