Each claim filed against a  carrier in the manner prescribed in this part shall be promptly and  thoroughly investigated if investigation has not already been made prior  to receipt of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supporting documents. When a necessary part of an investigation,  each claim shall be supported by the original bill of lading, evidence  of the freight charges, if any, and either the original invoice, a  photographic copy of the original invoice, or an exact copy thereof or  any extract made therefrom, certified by the claimant to be true and  correct with respect to the property and value involved in the claim; or  certification of prices or values, with trade or other discounts,  allowance, or deductions, of any nature whatsoever and the terms  thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon; Provided, however, That  where property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the  consignee shown on the bill of lading or where an invoice does not show  price or value, or where the property involved has been sold, or where  the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the  carrier shall, before voluntarily paying a claim, require the claimant  to establish the destination value in the quantity, shipped,  transported, or involved; Provided, further, That when supporting  documents are determined to be a necessary part of an investigation, the  supporting documents are retained by the carriers for possible FMCSA  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of loss. When an asserted claim for loss of an  entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated  upon investigation, the carrier shall obtain from the consignee of the  shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for  which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.</p>
