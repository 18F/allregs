                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the  presence of a prohibited drug:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the  use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test  or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Post-accident testing. As soon as possible but no later than 32  hours after an accident, an operator shall drug test each employee whose  performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely  discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may  decide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be  based on the best information available immediately after the accident  that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the  accident or that, because of the time between that performance and the  accident, it is not likely that a drug test would reveal whether the  performance was affected by drug use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Random testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)  through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for  random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum  annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported  positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this  determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this  subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator  considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain  additional information or reports from operators, and may make  appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate.  Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the  minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered  employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug  testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year  following publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing  is   50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all  covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received  under the reporting requirements of Sec. 199.119 for two consecutive  calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing  is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of  Sec. 199.119 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive  rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will  increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to  50 percent of all covered employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made  by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a  computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees'  Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other  comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each  covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time  selections are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of  covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an  annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random  drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts  random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be  tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on  the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are  subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage  rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted  under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering  random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing  under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same  operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the  percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency  regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under  the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool  containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same  required rate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest  percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to  which the operator is subject.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Testing based on reasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test  each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is  using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a  reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a  prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical,  behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two  of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of  the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the  decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two  supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with  50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one  supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use  symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Return-to-duty testing. A covered employee who refuses to take  or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered  function until the covered employee has complied with applicable  provisions of DOT Procedures concerning substance abuse professionals  and the return-to-duty process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has  a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug  tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's  return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall  be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall   consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the  covered employee's return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may  include testing for alcohol as directed by the substance abuse  professional, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow- up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the covered  employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional may  terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the  first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse  professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
