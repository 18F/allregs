(1) The information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement must be provided in tabular or spreadsheet form, as an electronic file in comma separated values format (.csv), only. No file formats other than .csv will be accepted, as your encryption self-classification report must be directly convertible to tabular or spreadsheet format, where each row (and all entries within a row) properly correspond to the appropriate encryption item.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(1): An encryption self-classification report data table created and stored in spreadsheet format (e.g., file extension .xls, .numbers, .qpw, .wb*, .wrk, and .wks) can be converted and saved into a comma delimited file format directly from the spreadsheet program. This .csv file is then ready for submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each line of your encryption self-classification report (.csv file) must consist of six entries as further described in this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The first line of the .csv file must consist of the following six entries (i.e., match the following) without alteration or variation: PRODUCT NAME, MODEL NUMBER, MANUFACTURER, ECCN, AUTHORIZATION TYPE, ITEM TYPE.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(3): These first six entries (i.e., first line) of a encryption self-classification report in .csv format correspond to the six column headers (i.e., first row) of a spreadsheet data file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each subsequent line of the .csv file must correspond to a single encryption item (or a distinguished series of products) as described in paragraph (c) of this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each line must consist of six entries as described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this supplement. No entries may be left blank. Each entry must be separated by a comma (,). Certain additional instructions are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Line entries (a)(1) (`PRODUCT NAME') and (a)(4) (`ECCN') must be completed with relevant information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For entries (a)(2) (`MODEL NUMBER') and (a)(3) (`MANUFACTURER'), if these entries do not apply to your item or situation you may enter `NONE' or `N/A'.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For entries (a)(5) (`AUTHORIZATION TYPE'), if none of the provided choices apply to your situation, you may enter `OTHER'.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Because of .csv file format requirements, the only permitted use of a comma is as the necessary separator between line entries. You may not use a comma for any other reason in your encryption self-classification report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other instructions. (1) The information provided in accordance with this supplement and Sec. Sec. 740.17(b)(1), 742.15(b)(1) and 742.15(c) of the EAR must identify product offerings as they are typically distinguished in inventory, catalogs, marketing brochures and other promotional materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The information provided in accordance with this supplement and Sec.
