                            <p class="depth0">Accident and incident investigations are conducted by the Board to  determine the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to an  accident or incident and the probable cause(s) thereof. These results  are then used to ascertain measures that would best tend to prevent  similar accidents or incidents in the future. The investigation includes  the field investigation (on-scene at the accident, testing, teardown,  etc.), report preparation, and, where ordered, a public hearing. The  investigation results in Board conclusions issued in the form of a  report or ``brief'' of the incident or accident. Accident/incident  investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no  adverse parties. They are not subject to the provisions of the  Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 504 et seq.), and are not  conducted for   the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person.
