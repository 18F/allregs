                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Counselor for the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her  designee, will serve as Counselor for the Commission and as the  Commission's representative to the Office of Government Ethics, on  matters covered by this subpart. The General Counsel will also serve as  the Commission's designated agency ethics official to review the  financial reports filed by high-level Commission officials under title  II of the Ethics in Government Act, as well as otherwise to coordinate  and manage the Commission's ethics program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duties of the Counselor. The Counselor shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coordinate the agency's counseling services and assure that  counseling and interpretations on questions of conflict of interests and  other matters covered by the regulations in this subpart are available  as needed to Regional Deputy Counselors, who shall be appointed by the  General Counsel, in coordination with the Chairman of the Commission,  for each Regional Office of the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Render authoritative advice and guidance on matters covered by  the regulations in this subpart which are presented to him or her by  employees in the Washington, DC headquarters office; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Receive information on, and resolve or forward to the Commission  for consideration, any conflict of interests or apparent conflict of  interests which appears in the annual financial disclosure (Standard  Form 278 or Standard Form 450), or is disclosed to the General Counsel  by a member or employee pursuant to Sec. 140.735-2a(d) of this part, or  otherwise is made known to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests is  considered resolved by the General Counsel when the affected member or  employee has executed an ethics agreement pursuant to 5 CFR 2634.801 et  seq. to undertake specific actions in order to resolve the actual or  apparent conflict.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, after advice and guidance from the General Counsel, a  member or employee does not execute an ethics agreement, the conflict of  interests is considered unresolved and must be referred to the  Commission for resolution or further action consistent with 18 U.S.C.  208 and 28 U.S.C. 535.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where an unresolved conflict of interests or apparent conflict  of interests is to be forwarded to the Commission by the General  Counsel, the General Counsel will promptly notify the affected member or  employee in writing of his or her intent to forward the matter to the  Commission. Any member or employee so affected will be afforded an  opportunity to be heard by the Commission through written submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regional Deputy Counselors.

Communications between the  Counselor and Regional Deputy Counselors and an employee shall be  confidential, except as deemed necessary by the Commission or the  Counselor to carry out the purposes of this subpart and of the laws of  the United States. \18\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\18\ No attorney-client privilege, however, attaches to such  communications since the Counselors are counsel to the Commission, not  to the employee. Thus, any evidence of criminal law violations divulged  by an employee to the Counselor must be reported by the latter to the  Commission, which may refer the matter to the Criminal Division of the  Department of Justice and the United States Attorney in whose venue the  violations lie.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Furnishing of conduct regulations. The Director of Human  Resources shall furnish a copy of this Conduct Regulation to each  member, employee, and special government employee immediately upon his  or her entrance on duty and shall thereafter, annually, and at such  other times as circumstances warrant, bring to the attention of each  member and employee this Conduct Regulation and all revisions thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Availability of counseling services. The Director of Human  Resources shall notify each member, employee, and special government  employee of the availability of counseling services and of how and where  these services are available at the time of entrance on duty and  periodically thereafter.
