                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the debtor submits a timely written request for a hearing as provided in Sec. 313.82(c), the FDIC will afford the debtor a hearing, which at the FDIC's option may be oral or written. The FDIC will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the Director determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the FDIC determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by the FDIC. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in person or by telephone

conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In cases when it is determined that an oral hearing is not required by this section, the FDIC will accord the debtor a ``paper hearing,'' that is, the FDIC will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record.</p>
