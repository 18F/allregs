The shock absorber and tire may be assumed to be in their static positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the side load, a limit vertical ground reaction equal to the static load on the tail wheel, in combination with a side component of equal magnitude, is assumed. In addition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a swivel is used, the tail wheel is assumed to be swiveled 90 degrees to the airplane longitudinal axis with the resultant ground load passing through the axle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a lock, steering device, or shimmy damper is used, the tail wheel is also assumed to be in the trailing position with the side load acting at the ground contact point; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The shock absorber and tire are assumed to be in their static positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a tail wheel, bumper, or an energy absorption device is provided to show compliance with Sec. 23.925(b), the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Suitable design loads must be established for the tail wheel, bumper, or energy absorption device; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The supporting structure of the tail wheel, bumper, or energy absorption device must be designed to withstand the loads established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
