                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Like the FLSA, the EPA applies to employees ``engaged in * * *  the production of goods for commerce.'' The broad meaning of  ``commerce'' as defined in section 3(b) of the FLSA has been outlind in  Sec. 1620.2. ``Goods'' is also comprehensively defined in section 3(i)  of the FLSA and includes ``articles or subjects of commerce of any  character, or any part or ingredient thereof'' not expressly excepted by  the statute. The activities constituting ``production'' of the goods for  commerce are defined in section 3(j) of the FLSA. These are not limited  to such work as manufacturing but include handling or otherwise working  on goods intended for shipment out of the State either directly or  indirectly or for use within the State to serve the needs of the  instrumentalities or facilities by which interstate or foreign commerce  is carried on. Employees engaged in any closely related process or  occupation directly essential to such production of any goods, whether  employed by the producer or by an independent employer, are also  engaged, by definition, in ``production.'' Thus, employees engaged in  the administration, planning, management, and control of the various  physical processes together with the accompanying clerical and  accounting activities are, from a productive standpoint and for purposes  of the FLSA, ``engaged in the production of goods for commerce.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate or  foreign commerce include those who work in manufacturing, processing,  and distributing establishments, including wholesale and retail  establishments that ``produce'' (including handling or working on) goods  for such commerce. This includes everyone employed in such  establishments, or elsewhere in the enterprises by which they are  operated, whose activities constitute ``production'' of such goods under  the principles outlined in paragraph (a) of this section. Thus,  employees who sell, process, load, pack, or otherwise handle or work on  goods which are to be shipped or delivered outside the State either by  their employer or by another firm, and either in the same form or as a  part or ingredient of other goods, are engaged in the production of  goods for commerce within the coverage of the FLSA. So also are the  office, management, sales, and shipping personnel, and maintenance,  custodial, and protective employees who perform as a part of the  integrated effort for the production of the goods for commerce, services  related to such production or to such goods or to the plant, equipment,  or personnel by which the production is accomplished.     Sec. 1620.4  ``Closely related'' and ``directly essential'' activities.</p><p class="depth2">An employee is engaged in the production of goods for interstate or  foreign commerce within the meaning of the FLSA even if the employees's  work is not an actual and direct part of such production, so long as the  employee is engaged in a process or occupation which is ``closely  related'' and ``directly essential'' to it. This is true whether the  employee is employed by the producer of the goods or by someone else who  provides goods or services to the producer. Typical of employees covered  under these principles are computer operators, bookkeepers,  stenographers, clerks, accountants, and auditors and other office and  whitecollar workers, and employees doing payroll, timekeeping, and time  study work for the producer of goods; employees in the personnel, labor  relations, employee benefits, safety and health, advertising, promotion,  and public relations activities of the producing enterprise; work  instructors for the producers; employees maintaining, servicing,  repairing or improving the buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles or  other facilities used in the production of goods for commerce, and such  custodial and productive employees as watchmen, guards, firemen,  patrolmen, caretakers, stockroom workers and warehousemen; and  transportation workers bringing supplies, materials, or equipment to the  producer's premises, removing waste materials therefrom, or transporting  materials or other goods, or performing such other transportation  activities, as the needs of production may require. These examples are  illustrative, rather than exhaustive, of the employees who are ``engaged  in the production of goods for commerce'' by reason of performing  activities closely related and directly essential to such production.</p>
