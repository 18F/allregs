As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0">Invention means any invention or discovery that is or may be  patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S. Code or  any variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant  Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.)</p><p class="depth0">Made means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When used in relation to any invention other than a plant  variety, means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of  the invention; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When used in relation to a plant variety, means that the  Contractor has at least tentatively determined that the variety has been  reproduced with recognized characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">Practical application, means to manufacture, in the case of a  composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method;  or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case,  under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being  utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or  Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p><p class="depth0">Subject invention, means any invention of the Contractor made in the  performance of work under this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ownership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assignment to the Government. The Contractor  shall assign to the Government title throughout the world to each  subject invention, except to the extent that rights are retained under  paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>Greater rights determinations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor, or an  employee-inventor after consultation with the Contractor, may request  greater rights than the nonexclusive license provided in paragraph (d)  of this clause. The request for a greater rights must be submitted to  the Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the  subject invention pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, or not  later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in  writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by  the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract  normally shall be subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, and to the  reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the filing date,  serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an  English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and  patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country  for which the Contractor has retained title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the agency an  irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application  file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum rights acquired by the Government. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Regarding each  subject invention to   which the Contractor retains ownership, the Contractor agrees as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Government will have a nonexclusive, nontransferable,  irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on  its behalf, the subject invention throughout the world.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35  U.S.C. 203 and 210(c) and in accordance with the procedures set forth in  37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on  the date of the contract award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon request, the Contractor shall submit periodic reports no  more frequently than annually on the utilization, or efforts to obtain  utilization, of a subject invention by the Contractor or its licensees  or assignees. The reports shall include information regarding the status  of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties  received by the Contractor, and any other data and information as the  agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also shall provide  additional reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with  any march-in proceedings undertaken by the agency in accordance with  paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause. To the extent data or information  supplied under this section is considered by the Contractor, or its  licensees, or assignees to be privileged and confidential and is so  marked, the agency, to the extent permitted by law, will not disclose  such information to persons outside the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When licensing a subject invention, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ensure that no royalties are charged on acquisitions involving  Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance  Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject  invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Provide for this refund in any instrument transferring rights in  the subject invention to any party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When transferring rights in a subject invention, the Contractor  shall provide for the Government's rights set forth in paragraphs  (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nothing contained in paragraph (c) of this clause shall be  deemed to grant to the Government rights in any invention other than a  subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minimum rights to the Contractor. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor is hereby  granted a revocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in each patent  application filed in any country on a subject invention and any  resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, unless the  Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times  specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license  extends to any of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the  corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part, and includes the  right to grant sublicenses to the extent the Contractor was legally  obligated to do so at contract award. The license is transferable only  with the written approval of the agency except when transferred to the  successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the subject  invention pertains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and 27.304-1(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the Government elects not to apply for a patent in any  foreign country, the Contractor retains rights in that foreign country  to apply for a patent, subject to the Government's rights in paragraph  (c)(1) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures  to educate its employees in order to assure that subject inventions are  promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible  for patent matters. The procedures shall include the maintenance of  laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are  reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual  reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show the  procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions are  followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting  Officer a description of these procedures for evaluation and for a  determination as to their effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall disclose in writing each subject invention  to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses  it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or,  if earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a  subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale  (i.e., sale or offer for sale), public use, or publication of the  subject invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure shall identify  the contract under which the subject invention was made and the  inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to  convey a clear understanding of the subject invention. The disclosure  shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of the  subject invention and whether a manuscript describing the subject  invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has  been accepted for publication. In addition, after disclosure to the  agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of  the acceptance of any   manuscript describing the subject invention for publication and any on  sale or public use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interim reports every 12 months (or a longer period as may be  specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract,  listing subject inventions during that period, and stating that all  subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are none) and that  the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause have been  followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A final report, within 3 months after completion of the  contracted work, listing all subject inventions or stating that there  were none, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent  rights clause or stating that there were none.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall require, by written agreement, its  employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose  promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the  administration of patent matters and in the Contractor's format each  subject invention in order that the Contractor can comply with the  disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute  all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions  and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This  disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required  by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such  employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational  programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient  time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or  foreign statutory bars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subject to FAR 27.302(i), the Contractor agrees that the  Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and  all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished  pursuant to this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examination of records relating to inventions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3  years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine  any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of  the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to  practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under  this contract to determine whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any inventions are subject inventions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures  required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) of this clause; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the  procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall disclose to the Contracting Officer, for  the determination of ownership rights, any unreported invention that the  Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any examination of records under paragraph (f) of this clause  will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality  of the information involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Withholding of payment. (This paragraph does not apply to  subcontracts.) (1) Any time before final payment under this contract,  the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold  payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount  of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in  the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for  identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph  (e)(1) of this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of  this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph  (e)(3)(i) of this clause; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to  paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contracting Officer will withhold the reserve or balance  until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has  rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports,  disclosures, and other information required by this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contracting Officer will not make final payment under this  contract before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer, as  required by this clause, all disclosures of subject inventions, an  acceptable final report, and all due confirmatory instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums  withheld up to the maximum authorized. The Contracting Officer will not  withhold any amount under this paragraph while the amount specified by  this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract.  The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment shall not be  construed as a waiver of any Government rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Preference for United States industry. Unless provided  otherwise, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any  person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the  United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the  subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention  will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in  individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the agency upon a  showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful  efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential  licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially   in the United States or that, under the circumstances, domestic  manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subcontracts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall include the substance of  the patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3 in all  subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work. The  prescribed patent rights clause must be modified to identify the parties  as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and the  subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the  clause. The Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for  awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject  inventions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to  accept the clause, the Contractor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting  Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and  other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written  authorization of the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In subcontracts at any tier, the agency, the subcontractor, and  the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created  by the patent rights clause constitute a contract between the  subcontractor and the agency with respect to those matters covered by  this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in  writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a  patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable  patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract,  and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the  Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such  subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the  subcontracts that have been awarded.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(e) (4), add the  following sentence at the end of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the basic  clause:</p><p class="depth0">The license will include the right of the Government to sublicense  foreign governments, their nationals, and international organizations  pursuant to the following treaties or international agreements: -------- --------*</p><p class="depth0">[* Contracting Officer complete with the names of applicable  existing treaties or international agreements. The above language is not  intended to apply to treaties or agreements that are in effect on the  date of the award but are not listed.]</p><p class="depth0">Alternate II (DEC 2007). As prescribed in 27.303(e) (5), add the  following sentence at the end of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the basic  clause:</p><p class="depth0">The agency reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to  identify specific treaties or international agreements entered into by  the Government before or after the effective date of this contract, and  effectuate those license or other rights that are necessary for the  Government to meet its obligations to foreign governments, their  nationals, and international organizations under treaties or  international agreements with respect to subject inventions made after  the date of the amendment.
