                            <p class="depth0">If the Commission determines that both of the criteria set forth in  Sec. Sec. 140.84 and 140.85 have been met, it will make the  determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence.  If the Commission publishes a notice in the Federal Register in  accordance with Sec. 140.82(a) and does not make a determination within  90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary nuclear  occurrence, the alleged event will be deemed not to be an extraordinary  nuclear occurrence. The time for the making of a determination may be  extended by the Commission by notice published in the Federal Register.  [33 FR 15999, Oct. 31, 1968]</p>
