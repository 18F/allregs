                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon the initiation of a case, the executive secretary shall  ascertain from the Agency, the grievant/charged employee and any labor  organization which has been certified as the exclusive representative of  employees of the Agency, whether the relevant position occupied by the  grievant/charged employee is part of the bargaining unit for which the  labor organization is the exclusive representative. If a substantial  dispute exists as to whether that position is part of the bargaining  unit, and if the Board determines that resolution of that dispute is  necessary for determining the status of the labor organization in a  case, the Board shall notify the parties and the labor organization, who  may request the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board to make a final  determination of that dispute. If the Foreign Service Labor Relations  Board determines that the grievant or charged employee is a member of a  bargaining unit represented by an exclusive representative, the  executive secretary shall promptly send a copy of the papers filed with  the Board to the exclusive representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exclusive representative has the right to intervene as a  party to the case if such exclusive representative gives timely notice  to the Board in writing of its decision to intervene as a party. Notice  shall be considered to be timely if given prior to or at the prehearing  conference, or, in a case to be decided under part 907 of this chapter,  if given within 10 days of receipt of a notice from the Board of the  Board's intent to close the record of proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An exclusive representative which has not intervened under  paragraph (b) of this section may be permitted to intervene as a party  upon written application. In ruling upon the application, the Board  shall consider whether granting the application will unduly delay or  prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and  may place conditions on the exclusive representative's participation to  avoid such delay or prejudice.</p>
