All  reports shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each  six-month period. Written reports of excess emissions shall include the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The magnitude of excess emissions computed in accordance with  Sec. 60.13(h), any conversion factor(s) used, and the date and time of  commencement and completion of each time period of excess emissions.

In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency  of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the  source's entire previous performance history during the required  recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance  test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's  conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such  information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about  the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the  Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the  frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or  operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner  or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the  owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is  based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days,  approval is automatically granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As soon as monitoring data indicate that the affected facility  is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter  specified in the applicable standard, the frequency of reporting shall  revert to the frequency specified in the applicable standard, and the  owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring  systems performance report (and summary report, if required) at the next  appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After  demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard for another full  year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the  Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard as  provided for in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part  shall maintain a file of all measurements, including continuous  monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing  measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations;  all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration  checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or  devices; and all other information required by this part recorded in a  permanent form suitable for inspection. The file shall be retained for  at least two years following the date of such measurements, maintenance,  reports, and records, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to  install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS  installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not  exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS  records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant  emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition  system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements  as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator  shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of  subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data  acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the  reportable form of the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to  install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the  reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages  do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of  maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under  paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all  subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The   subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of  the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to  the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all  measurements as required by paragraph (f) of this section, if the  Administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are  required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected  source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If notification substantially similar to that in paragraph (a)  of this section is required by any other State or local agency, sending  the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions  which clarify or make inapplicable the provisions set forth in this  section.
