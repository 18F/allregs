with one or more of the following criteria (unless otherwise specifically prohibited from combustion):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The waste contains hazardous organic constituents or cyanide at levels exceeding the constituent-specific treatment standard found in Sec.  268.48;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The waste consists of organic, debris-like materials (e.g., wood, paper, plastic, or cloth) contaminated with an inorganic metal-bearing hazardous waste;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The waste, at point of generation, has reasonable heating value such as greater than or equal to 5000 BTU per pound;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The waste is co-generated with wastes for which combustion is a required method of treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The waste is subject to Federal and/or State requirements necessitating reduction of organics (including biological agents); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The waste contains greater than 1% Total Organic Carbon (TOC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is a form of impermissible dilution, and therefore prohibited, to add iron filings or other metallic forms of iron to lead-containing hazardous wastes in order to achieve any land disposal restriction treatment standard for lead. Lead-containing wastes include D008 wastes (wastes exhibiting a characteristic due to the presence of lead), all characteristic wastes containing lead as an underlying hazardous constituent, listed wastes containing lead as a regulated constituent, and hazardous media containing any of the aforementioned lead-containing wastes.
