Commissioner will pay the State VR agency or alternate participant for the VR services described in Sec. 416.2214 which were provided during the period described in Sec. 416.2215 and which meet the criteria in Sec. 416.2211 or Sec. 416.2212, but subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The cost must have been incurred by the State VR agency or alternate participant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The cost must not have been paid or be payable from some other source. For this purpose, State VR agencies or alternate participants will be required to seek payment or services from other sources in accordance with the ``similar benefit'' provisions under 34 CFR part 361, including making maximum efforts to secure grant assistance in whole or part from other sources for training or training services in institutions of higher education. Alternate participants will not be required to consider State VR services a similar benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The cost must be reasonable and necessary, in that it complies with the written cost-containment policies of the State VR agency or, in the case of an alternate participant, it complies with similar written policies established under a negotiated plan. A cost which complies with these policies will be considered necessary only if the cost is for a VR service described in Sec. 416.2214. The State VR agency or alternate participant must maintain and use these cost-containment policies, including any reasonable and appropriate fee schedules, to govern the costs incurred for all VR services, including the rates of payment for all purchased services, for which payment will be requested under this subpart.

Such certification must be signed by the State's chief financial official or the head of the VR agency. Each certification must specify the basis upon which it is made, e.g., a recent audit by an authorized State, Federal or private auditor (or other independent compliance review) and the date of such audit (or compliance review). In the case of an alternate participant, these certification requirements shall be incorporated into the negotiated agreement or contract. We may request the State VR agency or alternate participant to submit to us a copy(ies) of its specific written cost-containment policies and procedures (e.g., any guidelines and fee schedules for a given year), if we determine that such additional information is necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart. The State VR agency or alternate participant shall provide such information when requested by us.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The total payment in each case, including any prior payments related to earlier continuous 9-month periods of SGA made under this subpart, must not be so high as to preclude a ``net saving'' to the general funds (a ``net saving'' is the difference between the estimated savings to the general fund, if payments for disability or blindness remain reduced or eventually terminate, and the total amount we pay to the State VR agency or alternate participant);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any payment to the State VR agency for either direct or indirect VR expenses must be consistent with the cost principles described in OMB Circular No. A-87, published at 46 FR 9548 on January 28, 1981 (see Sec. 416.2218(a) for cost principles applicable to alternate participants);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment for VR services or costs may be made under more than one of the VR payment provisions described in Secs. 416.2211 and 416.2212 of this subpart and similar provisions in Secs. 404.2111 and 404.2112 of subpart V of part 404. However, payment will not be made more than once for the same VR service or cost; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment will be made for administrative costs and for counseling and placement costs. This payment may be on a formula basis, or on an actual cost

basis, whichever the State VR agency prefers. The formula will be negotiated. The payment will also be subject to the preceding limitations.
