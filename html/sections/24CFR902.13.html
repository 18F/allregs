                                Sec. 902.13  Frequency of PHAS assessments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The frequency of a PHA's PHAS assessments is determined by the size of the PHA's Low-Rent program and its PHAS designation. HUD may, due to unforeseen circumstances or other cause as determined by HUD, extend the time between assessments by direct notice to the PHA and relevant resident organization or resident management entity, and any other general notice that HUD deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Small PHAs. HUD will assess and score the performance of a PHA with fewer than 250 public housing units, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A small PHA that is a high performer may receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer may receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All other small PHAs may receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with Sec. 902.75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of scoring for PHAs with 250 units or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All PHAs, other than stated in paragraph (a) of this section, may be assessed on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The physical condition score for each project will determine the frequency of inspections of each project. For projects with a physical condition score of 90 points or higher, physical inspections will be conducted every 3 years at the project. For projects with a physical condition score of less than 90 points but at least 80 points, physical inspection will be conducted every 2 years at the project. The physical condition score of 80 points or higher will be carried over to the next assessment period and averaged with the other project physical condition score(s) for the next assessment year for an overall PHAS physical condition indicator score. For projects whose physical condition score for a project is less than 80 points, physical inspections will be conducted annually at the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a PHA is designated as a troubled performer, all projects will receive a physical condition inspection regardless of the individual project physical condition score.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial submissions. HUD shall not issue a PHAS score for the unaudited and audited financial information in the years that a PHA is not being assessed under PHAS. Although HUD shall not issue a PHAS score under such circumstances, a PHA shall comply with the requirements for submission of annual unaudited and audited financial statements in accordance with subpart C of this part and 24 CFR 5.801.</p>
