Prior to considering the return  of contaminated leased land to owners, District Engineers will assist  installation commanders in preparing an analysis as a basis for  recommendation to acquire or not acquire such areas. In the case of  recommended restriction of use, notice should be given the lessor as  described in Sec. 644.525.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where such a restriction reduces the value of the land, the  Department will, if consistent with the terms of the lease, pay damages  equal to the reduction in value as of the effective date of termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As stated in Sec. 644.525, the owner should be advised that the  Department   is willing to remove or destory any potentially dangerous materials that  may be discovered in the future, subject to the availability of funds.</p>
