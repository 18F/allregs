IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD  BE AWARE THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE  LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE THE NET  ASSET VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN  THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR  ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION,  RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR  PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL.</p><p class="depth0">FURTHER, COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR  MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR  THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL  TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS  DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO  BE CHARGED THIS POOL AT PAGE (insert page number) AND A STATEMENT OF THE  PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE  AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).</p><p class="depth0">THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS  NECESSARY TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL.

TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE  THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES  MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR  DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED  STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF  THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES  JURISDICTIONS WHERE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the potential liability of a participant in the pool is  greater than the amount of the participant's contribution for the  purchase of an interest in the pool and the profits earned thereon,  whether distributed or not, the commodity pool operator must make the  following additional statement in the Risk Disclosure Statement, to be  prominently disclosed as the last paragraph thereof:</p><p class="depth0">ALSO, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS POOL, YOU SHOULD   NOTE THAT YOUR POTENTIAL LIABILITY AS A PARTICIPANT IN THIS POOL FOR  TRADING LOSSES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE POOL IS NOT LIMITED TO THE  AMOUNT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION FOR THE PURCHASE OF AN INTEREST IN THE POOL  AND ANY PROFITS EARNED THEREON. A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE LIABILITY  OF A PARTICIPANT IN THIS POOL IS EXPLAINED MORE FULLY IN THIS DISCLOSURE  DOCUMENT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the pool may engage in retail Forex transactions, the Risk  Disclosure Statement must further state:</p><p class="depth0">YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY ENGAGE IN OFF- EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING. SUCH TRADING IS NOT CONDUCTED IN THE  INTERBANK MARKET. THE FUNDS THAT THE POOL USES FOR OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRADING WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS FUNDS USED TO  MARGIN OR GUARANTEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS. IF THE  POOL DEPOSITS SUCH FUNDS WITH A COUNTERPARTY AND THAT COUNTERPARTY  BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE POOL'S CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS DEPOSITED OR PROFITS  EARNED ON TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY MAY NOT BE TREATED AS A  COMMODITY CUSTOMER CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF SUBCHAPTER IV OF CHAPTER 7 OF  THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE POOL MAY BE A  GENERAL CREDITOR AND ITS CLAIM MAY BE PAID, ALONG WITH THE CLAIMS OF  OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS, FROM ANY MONIES STILL AVAILABLE AFTER PRIORITY  CLAIMS ARE PAID. EVEN POOL FUNDS THAT THE COUNTERPARTY KEEPS SEPARATE  FROM ITS OWN FUNDS MAY NOT BE SAFE FROM THE CLAIMS OF PRIORITY AND OTHER  GENERAL CREDITORS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the pool may engage in swaps, the Risk Disclosure Statement  must further state:</p><p class="depth0">SWAPS TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A  VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A  PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE  TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS  TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK,  COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OPERATIONAL  RISK.</p><p class="depth0">HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE  LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY  LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN  VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR LEVEL OF  AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.</p><p class="depth0">IN EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH  A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A SWAP  TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE  ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED  TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR  TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE POOL'S OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOL'S  EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS  SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Table of contents.
