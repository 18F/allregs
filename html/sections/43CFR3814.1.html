                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 9 of the Act of December 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 864; 43  U.S.C. 299), provides that all entries made and patents issued under its  provisions shall contain a reservation to the United States of all coal  and other minerals in the lands so entered and patented, together with  the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same; also that the coal  and other mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by  the United States in accordance with the provisions of the coal and  mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Said section 9 also provides that any person qualified to locate  and enter the coal or other mineral deposits, or having the right to  mine and remove the same under the laws of the United States, shall have  the right at all times to enter upon the lands entered or patented under  the Act, for the purpose of prospecting for the coal or other mineral  therein, provided he shall not injure, damage, or destroy the permanent  improvements of the entryman or patentee and shall be liable to and  shall compensate the entryman or patentee for all damages to the crops  on the land by reason of such prospecting. Under the Act of June 21,  1949 (30 U.S.C. 54), a mineral entryman on a stock raising or other  homestead entry or patent is also held liable for any damage that may be  caused to the value of the land for grazing by such prospecting for,  mining, or removal of minerals except that vested rights existing prior  to June 21, 1949, are not impaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is further provided in said section 9 that any person who has  acquired from the United States the coal or other mineral deposits in  any such land or the right to mine and remove the same, may reenter and  occupy so much of the surface thereof as may be required for all  purposes reasonably incident to the mining or removal of the coal, or  other minerals, first, upon securing the written consent or waiver of  the homestead entryman or patentee; or, second, upon payment of the  damages to crops or other tangible improvements to the owner thereof  under agreement; or, third, in lieu of either of the foregoing  provisions, upon the execution of a good and sufficient bond or  undertaking to the United States for the use and benefit of the entryman  or owner of the land, to secure payment of such damages to the crops or  tangible improvements of the entryman or owner as may be determined and  fixed in an action brought upon the bond or undertaking in a court of  competent jurisdiction against the principal and sureties thereon. This  bond on Form 3814 must be executed by the person who has acquired from  the United States the coal or other mineral deposits reserved, as  directed in said section 9, as principal, with two competent individual  sureties, or a bonding company which has complied with the requirements  of the Act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. 279; 6 U.S.C. 6-13), as amended  by the Act of March 23, 1910 (36 Stat. 241; 6 U.S.C. 8, 9), and must be  in the sum of not less than $1,000. Qualified corporate sureties are  preferred and may be accepted as sole surety. Except in the case of a  bond given by a qualified corporate surety there must be filed therewith  affidavits of justification by the sureties and a certificate by a judge  or clerk of a court of record, a United States district attorney, a  United States commissioner, or a United States postmaster as to the  identity, signatures, and financial competency of the sureties. Said  bond, with accompanying papers, must be filed with the authorized  officer of the proper office, and there must also be filed with such  bond evidence of service of a copy of the bond upon the homestead  entryman or owner of the land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If at the expiration of 30 days after the receipt of the  aforesaid copy of the bond by the entryman or owner of the land, no  objections are made by such entryman or owner of the land and filed with  the authorized officer against the approval of the bond by them, he may,  if all else be regular, approve said bond. If, however, after receipt by  the homestead entryman or owner of the lands of copy of the bond, such  homestead entryman or owner of   the land timely objects to the approval of the bond by said authorized  officer, the said officer will immediately give consideration to said  bond, accompanying papers, and objections filed as aforesaid to the  approval of the bond, and if, in consequence of such consideration he  shall find and conclude that the proffered bond ought not to be  approved, he will render decision accordingly and give due notice  thereof to the person proffering the bond, at the same time advising  such person of his right of appeal to the Director of the Bureau of Land  Management from the action in disapproving the bond so filed and  proffered. If, however, the authorized officer, after full and complete  examination and consideration of all the papers filed, is of the opinion  that the proffered bond is a good and sufficient one and that the  objections interposed as provided herein against the approval thereof do  not set forth sufficient reasons to justify him in refusing to approve  said proffered bond, he will, in writing, duly notify the homestead  entryman or owner of the land of his decision in this regard and allow  such homestead entryman or owner of the land 30 days in which to appeal  to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. If appeal from the  adverse decision of the authorized officer be not timely filed by the  person proffering the bond, the authorized officer will indorse upon the  bond ``disapproved'' and other appropriate notations, and close the  case. If, on the other hand, the homestead entryman or owner of the  lands fails to timely appeal from the decision of the authorized officer  adverse to the contentions of said homestead entryman or owners of the  lands, said authorized officer may, if all else be regular, approve the  bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The coal and other mineral deposits in the lands entered or  patented under the Act of December 29, 1916, will become subject to  existing laws, as to purchase or lease, at any time after allowance of  the homestead entry unless the lands or the coal or other mineral  deposits are, at the time of said allowance, withdrawn or reserved from  disposition.  [35 FR 9743, June 13, 1970, as amended at 41 FR 29122, July 15, 1976]</p>
