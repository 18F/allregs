                            <p class="depth0">This section provides a functional overview of subpart E. In the  event of any inconsistency with definitions found in Sec. 60.2, those  definitions shall prevail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The HLW facility. NRC exercises licensing and related regulatory  authority over those facilities described in section 202 (3) and (4) of  the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Any of these facilities is  designated a HLW facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The geologic repository operations area. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This part deals  with the exercise of authority with respect to a particular class of HLW  facility--namely a geologic repository operations area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A geologic repository operations area consists of those surface  and subsurface areas that are part of a geologic repository where  radioactive waste handling activities are conducted. The underground  structure, including openings and backfill materials, but excluding  shafts, boreholes, and their seals, is designated the underground  facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The exercise of Commission authority requires that the geologic  repository operations area be used for storage (which includes disposal)  of high-level radioactive wastes (HLW).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HLW includes irradiated reactor fuel as well as reprocessing  wastes. However, if DOE proposes to use the geologic repository  operations area for storage of radioactive waste other than HLW, the  storage of this radioactive waste is subject to the requirements of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Areas related to isolation. Although the activities subject to  regulation under this part are those to be carried out at the geologic  repository operations area, the licensing process also considers  characteristics of adjacent areas that are defined in other ways. There  is to be an area surrounding the underground facility referred to above,  which is designated the postclosure controlled area, within which DOE is  to exercise specified controls to prevent adverse human actions  following permanent closure. The location of the controlled area is the  site. The accessible environment is the atmosphere, land surface,  surface water, oceans, and the portion of the lithosphere that is  outside the controlled area. There is an area, designated the geologic  setting, which includes the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical  systems of the region in which a geologic repository operations area is  or may be located. The geologic repository operations area plus the  portion of the geologic setting that provides isolation of the  radioactive waste make up the geologic repository.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stages in the licensing process. There are several stages in the  licensing process. The site characterization stage, though begun before  submission of a license application, may result in consequences  requiring evaluation in the license review. The construction stage would  follow, after issuance of a construction authorization. A period of  operations follows the issuance of a license by the Commission. The  period of operations includes the time during which emplacement of  wastes occurs; any subsequent period before permanent closure during  which the emplaced wastes are retrievable; and permanent closure, which  includes sealing of shafts. Permanent closure represents the end of  active human intervention with respect to the engineered barrier system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Isolation of waste. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the first several hundred years  following permanent closure of a geologic repository, when radiation and  thermal levels are high and the uncertainties in assessing repository  performance are large, special emphasis is placed upon the ability to  contain the wastes by waste packages within an engineered barrier  system. This is known as the containment period. The engineered barrier  system includes the waste packages and the underground facility. A waste  package is composed of the waste form and any containers, shielding,  packing, and absorbent materials immediately surrounding an individual  waste container. The underground facility means the underground  structure, including openings and backfill materials, but excluding,  shafts, boreholes, and their seals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following the containment period special emphasis is placed upon  the ability to achieve isolation of the wastes by virtue of the  characteristics of the geologic repository. The engineered barrier  system works to control the release of radioactive material to the  geologic setting and the geologic setting works to control the release  of radioactive material to the accessible environment. Isolation means  inhibiting the transport of radioactive material so that amounts and  concentrations of the materials entering the accessible environment will  be kept within prescribed limits.
