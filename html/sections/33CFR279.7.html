                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Data search. This effort consists of collecting existing data  and accomplishing the minimum additional studies necessary to obtain the  information required to generate and analyze the likely options. State  and local agency input should be sought during this phase. The initial  work will be to determine separately the options for resource use and  public needs. A preliminary analysis comparing the two parts and their  relationship to authorized project purposes and administrative  constraints should be conducted prior to further public and agency  input.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project resources. The natural and man-made resources of the  project area are to be identified and the inter-relationships analyzed  to generate the options that are most viable to the overall region. The  environmental information and analysis, among other things, should  define and describe the physical limitations of the project, aquatic and  terrestrial vegetation, game and non-game wildlife species and  distribution, fisheries, terrain, soils, minerals, climate, capacity and  sensitivity of these resources to public use, archaeological and  historical resources, management techniques, and ecosystem interactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Social needs and benefits. The problems, opportunities, and  desires of the people of the region to be served by the project must be  identified in order to determine options that are in the best overall  public interest. The basic approach for determining public needs and  benefits is through a market analysis and a public involvement program.  In considering options, the analysis as a minimum should include the  indentification of the various publics served, views of other agencies  and organizations, existing and planned recreational facilities in the  market area of the consumer, the population base and distribution,  institutional analysis of potential cost-sharing partners, constraints,  the transportation network, the needs identified by local, State and  Federal agencies, and the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan  (SCORP).</p>
