When an officer of any participant or an  attorney acting in a representative capacity appears in person, submits  a document to the Commission online as a Principal Account Holder, or  signs a paper filed with the Commission, his/her personal appearance,  online submission, or signature, shall constitute a representation to  the Commission that he/she is authorized to represent the particular  participant in whose behalf he/she acts. Any person appearing before or  transacting business with the Commission in a representative capacity  may be required by the Commission or the presiding officer to file  evidence of his/her authority to act in such capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of appearance and withdrawal of appearance. An individual  intending to appear before the Commission or its presiding officer in a  representative capacity for a participant in a proceeding shall file  with the Commission a notice of appearance in the form prescribed by the  Secretary unless that individual is named in an initial filing of the  participant whom he/she represents as a person to whom communications  from the Commission in regard to the filing are to be addressed.
