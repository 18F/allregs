Titles and Records Offices are designated as Certifying Officers for this purpose. When a copy or reproduction of a title document is authenticated by the official seal and certified by a Manager, Land Titles and Records Office, the copy or reproduction shall be admitted into evidence the same as the original from which it was made. The fees for furnishing such certified copies are established by a uniform fee schedule applicable to all constituent units of the Department of the Interior and published in 43 CFR part 2, appendix A.</p>
