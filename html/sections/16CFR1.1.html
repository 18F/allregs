The Commission will consider such requests for advice and inform the requesting party of the Commission's views, where practicable, under the following circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The matter involves a substantial or novel question of fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court precedent; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The subject matter of the request and consequent publication of Commission advice is of significant public interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission has authorized its staff to consider all requests for advice and to render advice, where practicable, in those circumstances in which a Commission opinion would not

be warranted. Hypothetical questions will not be answered, and a request for advice will ordinarily be considered inappropriate where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The same or substantially the same course of action is under investigation or is or has been the subject of a current proceeding involving the Commission or another governmental agency, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An informed opinion cannot be made or could be made only after extensive investigation, clinical study, testing, or collateral inquiry.
