Document five items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Average carbon feed rate (in kilograms or pounds per hour) during all stack tests for dioxins/furans and mercury emissions. Include supporting calculations in the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the operating parameter chosen to monitor carbon feed rate, average operating level during all stack tests for dioxins/furans and mercury emissions. Include supporting data that document the relationship between the operating parameter and the carbon feed rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All 8-hour block average carbon feed rates in kilograms (pounds) per hour calculated from the monitored operating parameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total carbon purchased and delivered to the municipal waste combustion plant for each calendar quarter. If you choose to evaluate total carbon purchased and delivered on a municipal waste combustion unit basis, record the total carbon purchased and delivered for each individual municipal waste combustion unit at your plant. Include supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Required quarterly usage of carbon for the municipal waste combustion plant, calculated using the appropriate equation in Sec. 62.15390(f). If you choose to evaluate required quarterly usage for carbon on a municipal waste combustion unit basis, record the required quarterly usage for each municipal waste combustion unit at your plant. Include supporting calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records of low carbon feed rates. Document three items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The calendar dates when the average carbon feed rate over an 8-hour block was less than the average carbon feed rates determined during the most recent stack test for dioxins/furans or mercury emissions (whichever has a higher feed rate).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for the low carbon feed rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corrective actions you took or are taking to meet the 8-hour average carbon feed rate requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records of minimum carbon feed rate data. Document three items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calendar dates for which you did not collect the minimum amount of carbon feed rate data required under Sec. 62.15280.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons you did not collect the minimum data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corrective actions you took or are taking to get the required amount of data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records of exclusions.
