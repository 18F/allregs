In furtherance of the use of rehabilitated furniture and office machines, agencies shall review inventories on a continuing basis to ascertain those items which can be economically rehabilitated and institute programs for their orderly repair and rehabilitation. All such items which are not required for immediate needs shall be reported as excess.
