                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Bicycles shall be equipped with reflective devices to permit recognition and identification under illumination from motor vehicle headlamps. The use of reflector combinations off the center plane of the bicycle (defined in Sec. 1512.18(m)(2)) is acceptable if each reflector meets the requirements of this section and of Sec. 1512.18 (m) and (n) and the combination of reflectors has a clear field of view of 10[deg] vertically and 50[deg] horizontally. Sidewalk bicycles are not required to have reflectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Front, rear, and pedal reflectors. There shall be an essentially colorless front-facing reflector, essentially colorless or amber pedal reflectors, and a red rear-facing reflector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Side reflectors. There shall be retroreflective tire sidewalls or, alternatively, reflectors mounted on the spokes of each wheel, or, for non-caliper rim brake bicycles, retroreflective wheel rims. The center of spoke-mounted reflectors shall be within 76 mm (3.0 in.) of the inside of the rim. Side reflective devices shall be visible on each side of the wheel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Front reflector. The reflector or mount shall not contact the ground plane when the bicycle is resting on that plane in any orientation. The optical axis of the reflector shall be directed forward within 5[deg] of the horizontal-vertical alignment of the bicycle when the wheels are tracking in a straight line, as defined in Sec. 1512.18(m)(2). The reflectors and/or mounts shall incorporate a distinct, preferred assembly method that shall insure that the reflector meets the optical requirements of this paragraph (c) when the reflector is attached to the bicycle. The front reflector shall be tested in accordance with the reflector mount and alignment test, Sec. 1512.18(m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rear reflector. The reflector or mount shall not contact the ground plane when the bicycle is resting on that plane in any orientation. The reflector shall be mounted such that it is to the rear of the seat mast with the top of the reflector at least 76 mm (3.0

in) below the point on the seat surface that is intersected by the line of the seat post. The optical axis of the reflector shall be directed rearward within 5[deg] of the horizontal-vertical alignment of the bicycle when the wheels are traveling in a straight line, as defined in Sec. 1512.18(m)(2). The reflectors and/or mounts shall incorporate a distinct, preferred assembly method that shall insure that the reflector meets the optical requirements of this paragraph (d) when the reflector is attached to the bicycle. The rear reflector shall be tested in accordance with the reflector mount and alignment test, Sec. 1512.18(m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pedal reflectors. Each pedal shall have reflectors located on the front and rear surfaces of the pedal. The reflector elements may be either integral with the construction of the pedal or mechanically attached, but shall be sufficiently recessed from the edge of the pedal, or of the reflector housing, to prevent contact of the reflector element with a flat surface placed in contact with the edge of the pedal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Side reflectors. Reflectors affixed to the wheel spokes shall be mounted either flat on the spokes or within the spoke cage such that the angle between the optical axis and the normal to the plane of the wheel shall not exceed the angle of the spokes with the plane of the wheel. The reflectors shall not interfere with any wheel adjustments. The side-mounted reflector devices shall be essentially colorless or amber on the front wheel and essentially colorless or red on the rear wheel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reflector tests. The pedal, front-mount, rear-mount, and side-mount reflectors shall be tested in accordance with the reflector test, Sec. 1512.18(n), to assure the reflectance values over the angles given in tables 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retroreflective tire sidewalls. When retroreflective tire sidewalls are used in lieu of spoke-mounted reflectors, the reflecting material shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The retroreflective material shall form a continuous circle on the sidewall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The retroreflective material shall adhere to the tire such that after the tire has been subjected to a temperature of 50[deg] 3 [deg]C (122[deg] 5.4 [deg]F) for 30 minutes, the retroreflective material cannot be peeled or scraped away without removal of tire material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The retroreflective material shall be as resistant to abrasion as is the adjacent sidewall material so that when retroreflective material is removed from the inflated tire by abrasion with a wet, steel bristle brush, tire material will be removed along with the retroreflective material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The retroreflective material shall be tested for performance in accordance with the retroreflective tire test, Sec. 1512.18(o), to assure the reflectance properties over the angles given in table 3. When a portion of the retroreflective material is selected (and the remainder is masked as specified in Sec. 1512.18(o)(2)(i)), the selected portion shall not contact the ground plane when the assembled bicycle is resting on that plane in any orientation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Retroreflective rims. When retroreflective rims are used in lieu of spoke-mounted reflectors or retroreflective tire sidewalls, the reflecting material shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The retroreflective material shall form a continuous circle on the rim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the retroreflective material is applied to the rim in the form of a self-adhesive tape, the following requirement must be met: Use a sharp knife, razor blade, or similar instrument to carefully release an end of the tape material sufficient to be grasped between the thumb and finger. Grasp the freed tape end and gradually pull in a direction 90[deg] to the plane of the rim. The tape material must break before additional separation (peeling) from the rim is observed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After the retroreflective material is abraded in accordance with the abrasion test for retroreflective rims at Sec. 1512.18(r), the rim must then be tested for performance in accordance with the retroreflective tire and rim test at Sec. 1512.18(o), to assure the reflectance properties over the angles given in table 3.
