                            <p class="depth0">OTS will bill you semi-annually for your assessments. Assessments  are due January 31 and July 31 of each year, unless that date is a  Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. If the due date is a Saturday,  Sunday or Federal holiday, your assessment is due on the first day  preceding the due date that is not a Saturday, Sunday or Federal  holiday. At least seven days before your assessment is due, the Director  will mail you a notice that indicates the amount of your assessment,  explains how OTS calculated the amount, and specifies when payment is  due.</p>
