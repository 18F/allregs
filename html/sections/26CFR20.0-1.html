                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulations in this part (part 20,  subchapter B, chapter I, title 26, Code of Federal Regulations) are  designated ``Estate Tax Regulations.'' These regulations pertain to (i)  the Federal estate tax imposed by chapter 11 of subtitle B of the  Internal Revenue Code on the transfer of estates of decedents dying  after August 16, 1954, and (ii) certain related administrative  provisions of subtitle F of the Code. It should be noted that the  application of many of the provisions of these regulations may be  affected by the provisions of an applicable death tax convention with a  foreign country. Unless otherwise indicated, references in the  regulations to the ``Internal Revenue Code'' or the ``Code'' are  references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and  references to a section or other provision of law are references to a  section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as  amended. Unless otherwise provided, the Estate Tax Regulations are  applicable to the estates of decedents dying after August 16, 1954, and  supersede the regulations contained in part 81, subchapter B, chapter I,  title 26, Code of Federal Regulations (1939) (Regulations 105, Estate  Tax), as prescribed and made applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of  1954 by Treasury Decision 6091, signed August 16, 1954 (19 FR 5167, Aug.  17, 1954). The regulations in this part do not reflect the amendments  made by the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1539).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 2208 makes the provisions of chapter 11 of the Code  apply to the transfer of the estates of certain decedents dying after  September 2, 1958, who were citizens of the United States and residents  of a possession thereof at the time of death. Section 2209 makes the  provisions of chapter 11 apply to the transfer of the estates of certain  other decedents dying after September 14, 1960, who were citizens of the  United States and residents of a possession thereof at the time of  death. See Sec. Sec. 20.2208-1 and 20.2209-1. Except as otherwise  provided in Sec. Sec. 20.2208-1 and 20.2209-1, the provisions of these  regulations do not apply to the estates of such decedents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of regulations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Estates of citizens or residents.  Subchapter A of Chapter 11 of the Code pertains to the taxation of the  estate of a person who was a citizen or a resident of the United States  at the time of his death. A ``resident'' decedent is a decedent who, at  the time of his death, had his domicile in the United States. The term  ``United States'', as used in the estate tax regulations, includes only  the States and the District of Columbia. The term also includes the  Territories of Alaska and Hawaii prior to their admission as States. See  section   7701(a)(9). A person acquires a domicile in a place by living there, for  even a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later  removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain  indefinitely will not suffice to constitute domicile, nor will intention  to change domicile effect such a change unless accompanied by actual  removal. For the meaning of the term ``citizen of the United States'' as  applied in a case where the decedent was a resident of a possession of  the United States, see Sec. 20.2208-1. The regulations pursuant to  subchapter A are set forth in Sec. Sec. 20.2001-1 to 20.2056(d)-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estates of nonresidents not citizens. Subchapter B of Chapter 11  of the Code pertains to the taxation of the estate of a person who was a  nonresident not a citizen of the United States at the time of his death.  A ``nonresident'' decedent is a decedent who, at the time of his death,  had his domicile outside the United States under the principles set  forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. (See, however, section 2202  with respect to missionaries in foreign service.) The regulations  pursuant to subchapter B are set forth in Sec. Sec. 20.2101-1 to  20.2107-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Miscellaneous substantive provisions. Subchapter C of Chapter 11  of the Code contains a number of miscellaneous substantive provisions.  The regulations pursuant to subchapter C are set forth in Sec. Sec.  20.2201-1 to 20.2209-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedure and administration provisions. Subtitle F of the  Internal Revenue Code contains some sections which are applicable to the  Federal estate tax. The regulations pursuant to those sections are set  forth in Sec. Sec. 20.6001-1 to 20.7101-1. Such regulations do not  purport to be all the regulations on procedure and administration which  are pertinent to estate tax matters. For the remainder of the  regulations on procedure and administration which are pertinent to  estate tax matters, see part 301 (Regulations on Procedure and  Administration) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Arrangement and numbering. Each section of the regulations in  this part (other than this section and Sec. 20.0-2) is designated by a  number composed of the part number followed by a decimal point (20.);  the section of the Internal Revenue Code which it interprets; a hyphen  (-); and a number identifying the section. By use of these designations  one can ascertain the sections of the regulations relating to a  provision of the Code. For example, the regulations pertaining to  section 2012 of the Code are designated Sec. 20.2012-1.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6526, 26 FR  414, Jan. 19, 1961; T.D. 7238, 37 FR 28717, Dec. 29, 1972; T.D. 7296, 38  FR 34191, Dec. 12, 1973; T.D. 7665, 45 FR 6089, Jan. 25, 1980; T.D.  8522, 59 FR 9646, Mar. 1, 1994]</p>
