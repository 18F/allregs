(Small business size standards matched to industry NAICS codes are published by the Small Business Administration and are available at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.) The Offeror is therefore encouraged to develop the capabilities and characteristics typically desired in contractors that are competitive as other-than-small contractors in this industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For procurement technical assistance, the Offeror may contact the nearest Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC). PTAC locations are available at www.dla.mil/SmallBusiness/Pages/ptac.aspx.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)
