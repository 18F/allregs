                                Sec. 19.352  Bottling tanks.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Generally, a proprietor must bottle all spirits from tanks that are  listed in the notice of registration and have been certified as  accurate. However, if a proprietor files a letterhead application and  shows the need to do so, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize  bottling from original packages, tank trucks, totes or special  containers where it is not practical to use a bottling tank. In  addition, a proprietor may bottle liqueurs directly from a tank truck or  tote without applying for permission to TTB if the liqueurs are gauged  prior to unloading and piped directly to the bottling line.  (26 U.S.C. 5201)</p>
