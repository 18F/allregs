                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. Every application for Federal financial  assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal  financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its  approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant  to the application, contain, be accompanied by, or identify and make  reference to, an assurance that the program will be conducted or   the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or  pursuant to this part. If the assurance is not made a part of the  application, the application shall identify the assurance which is  applicable to the application. One assurance shall suffice for all  applications of an applicant if the assurance complies with the  conditions made applicable by this part to each such application for  Federal financial assistance. Every assurance shall include provisions  which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of assurances. The period of time to be covered by the  assurances required under this Sec. 1250.104 shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Real property. In the case of an application for Federal  financial assistance for providing real property or structures thereon,  the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a  subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the  real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal  financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the  provision of similar services or benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personal property. In the case of an application for Federal  financial assistance for providing personal property, the assurance  shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains  ownership or possession of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other kinds of Federal financial assistance. In the case of an  application for any other kind of Federal financial assistance, the  assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which  Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assurances for research, training, or educational programs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In the case of application by an institution of higher education or any  other organization for Federal financial assistance for a program or  activity which involves participation by students, fellows or trainees,  including but not limited to assistance for research, training, or the  provision of facilities, the assurance required by this Sec. 1250.104  shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating  to the treatment of students or other participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assurances from such an applicant shall be applicable to the  entire organization of the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assurances for construction of facilities. In the case of  assistance for the construction of a facility, or part thereof, the  assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated  in connection therewith. In grants to assist in the construction of  facilities for the provision of research, training, or educational  services, assurances will be required that services will be provided  without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be  forbidden as a condition of grants for the support of such services.  Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic,  research or other facilities at institutions of higher education,  assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the  admission or treatment of students. Also, see paragraph (c) of this  section for the requirement as to the applicability of the assurance to  the applicant's organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Instrument effecting or recording transfers of real property.  The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a  covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period  during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the  Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose  involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no  transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal  financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a  covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property  is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include  a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title  to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the  discretion of the responsible NASA official, such a condition and right  of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property  is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Assurances for transfer of surplus real property. Transfers of  surplus property are subject to regulations issued   by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Form of assurances. The responsible NASA officials shall specify  the form of assurances required by this Sec. 1250.104 and the extent to  which like assurances will be required by subgrantees, contractors and  subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other  participants in the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Requests for proposals. Any request for proposals issued by NASA  which relates to covered financial assistance listed in appendix A shall  have set forth therein or have attached thereto the assurance prescribed  in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and shall require that  the proposer either include the assurance as a part of his signed  proposal or identify and refer to an assurance already signed and  submitted by the proposer.
