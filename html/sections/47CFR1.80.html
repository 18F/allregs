The remaining provisions of this section are applicable to such conduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limits on the amount of forfeiture assessed. (1) If the violator is a broadcast station licensee or permittee, a cable television operator, or an applicant for any broadcast or cable television operator license, permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by the Commission, except as otherwise noted in this paragraph, the forfeiture penalty under this section shall not exceed $37,500 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $400,000 for

any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section. There is no limit on forfeiture assessments for EEO violations by cable operators that occur after notification by the Commission of a potential violation. See section 634(f)(2) of the Communications Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section, if the violator is a broadcast station licensee or permittee or an applicant for any broadcast license, permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by the Commission, and if the violator is determined by the Commission to have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane material, the forfeiture penalty under this section shall not exceed $350,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $3,300,000 for any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the violator is a common carrier subject to the provisions of the Communications Act or an applicant for any common carrier license, permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by the Commission, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this section shall not exceed $160,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $1,575,000 for any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the violator is a manufacturer or service provider subject to the requirements of section 255, 716, or 718 of the Communications Act, and is determined by the Commission to have violated any such requirement, the manufacturer or service provider shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of not more than $105,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $1,050,000 for any single act or failure to act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any person determined to have violated section 227(e) of the Communications Act or the rules issued by the Commission under section 227(e) of the Communications Act shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation or three times that amount for each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $1,025,000 for any single act or failure to act. Such penalty shall be in addition to any other forfeiture penalty provided for by the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a violator who is granted access to the Do-Not-Call registry of public safety answering points discloses or disseminates any registered telephone number without authorization, in violation of section 6507(b)(4) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 or the Commission's implementing rules, the monetary penalty for such unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of a telephone number from the registry shall be not less than $100,000 per incident nor more than $1,000,000 per incident depending upon whether the conduct leading to the violation was negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, or willful, and depending on whether the violation was a first or subsequent offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a violator uses automatic dialing equipment to contact a telephone number on the Do-Not-Call registry of public safety answering points, in violation of section 6507(b)(5) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 or the Commission's implementing rules, the monetary penalty for contacting such a telephone number shall be not less than $10,000 per call nor more than $100,000 per call depending on whether the violation was negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, or willful, and depending on whether the violation was a first or subsequent offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In any case not covered in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this section shall not exceed $16,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $122,500 for any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Factors considered in determining the amount of the forfeiture penalty. In determining the amount of the forfeiture penalty, the Commission or its designee will take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violations and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(8):</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for Assessing Forfeitures. The Commission and its staff may use these guidelines in particular cases. The Commission and its staff retain the discretion to issue a higher or lower forfeiture than provided in the guidelines, to issue no forfeiture at all, or to apply alternative or additional sanctions as permitted by the statute. The forfeiture ceilings per violation or per day for a continuing violation stated in section 503 of the Communications Act and the Commission's rules are described in Sec. 1.80(b)(9). These statutory maxima became effective September 13, 2013. Forfeitures issued under other sections of the Act are dealt with separately in section III of this note.</p><p class="depth0">Section I.

Non-Section 503 Forfeitures That Are Affected by the</p><p class="depth0">Downward Adjustment Factors</p><p class="depth0">Unlike section 503 of the Act, which establishes maximum forfeiture amounts, other sections of the Act, with two exceptions, state prescribed amounts of forfeitures for violations of the relevant section. These amounts are then subject to mitigation or remission under section 504 of the Act. One exception is section 223 of the Act, which provides a maximum forfeiture per day. For convenience, the Commission will treat this amount as if it were a prescribed base amount, subject to downward adjustments. The other exception is section 227(e) of the Act, which provides maximum forfeitures per violation, and for continuing violations. The Commission will apply the factors set forth in section 503(b)(2)(E) of the Act and section III of this note to determine the amount of the penalty to assess in any particular situation. The following amounts are adjusted for inflation pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), 28 U.S.C. 2461. These non-section 503 forfeitures may be adjusted downward using the ``Downward Adjustment Criteria'' shown for section 503 forfeitures in section II of this note.

(i) Pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321-358), which amends the Federal Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410 (104 Stat. 890; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note), the statutory maximum amount of a forfeiture penalty assessed under this section shall be adjusted for inflation at least once every four years using the method specified in the statute. This is to be done by determining the `cost-of-living adjustment', which is the percentage (if any) by which the CPI for

June of the preceding year exceeds the CPI for June of the year the forfeiture amount was last set or adjusted. The inflation adjustment is determined by multiplying the cost-of-living adjustment by the statutory maximum amount. Round off this result using the rules in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. Add the rounded result to the statutory maximum forfeiture penalty amount. The sum is the statutory maximum amount, adjusted for inflation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rounding rules are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10 if the penalty is from $0 to $100;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $100 if the penalty is from $101 to $1,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $1,000 if the penalty is from $1,001 to $10,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $5,000 if the penalty is from $10,001 to $100,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10,000 if the penalty is from $100,001 to $200,000; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Round increase to the nearest multiple of $25,000 if the penalty is over $200,001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of the inflation adjustments required by the DCIA, 28 U.S.C. 2461, results in the following adjusted statutory maximum forfeitures authorized by the Communications Act:

For purposes of this paragraph, ``date of commencement of the current license term'' means the date of commencement of the last term of license for which the licensee has been granted a license by the Commission.

the Commission, unless, prior to the issuance of the appropriate notice, such person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is sent a citation reciting the violation charged;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is given a reasonable opportunity (usually 30 days) to request a personal interview with a Commission official, at the field office which is nearest to such person's place of residence; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsequently engages in conduct of the type described in the citation. However, a forfeiture penalty may be imposed, if such person is engaged in (and the violation relates to) activities for which a license, permit, certificate, or other authorization is required or if such person is a cable television operator, or in the case of violations of section 303(q), if the person involved is a nonlicensee tower owner who has previously received notice of the obligations imposed by section 303(q) from the Commission or the permittee or licensee who uses that tower. Paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the issuance of citations.

Any showing as to why the forfeiture should not be imposed or should be reduced shall include a detailed factual statement and such documentation and affidavits as may be pertinent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Forfeiture order. If the proposed forfeiture penalty is not paid in full in response to the notice of apparent liability, the Commission, upon considering all relevant information available to it, will issue an order canceling or reducing the proposed forfeiture or requiring that it be paid in full and stating the date by which the forfeiture must be paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Judicial enforcement of forfeiture order. If the forfeiture is not paid, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for collection under section 504(a) of the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Notice of opportunity for hearing. The procedures set out in this paragraph will ordinarily be followed only when a hearing is being held for some reason other than the assessment of a forfeiture (such as, to determine whether a renewal application should be granted) and a forfeiture is to be considered as an alternative or in addition to any other Commission action. However, these procedures may be followed whenever the Commission, in its discretion, determines that they will better serve the ends of justice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Before imposing a forfeiture penalty under the provisions of this paragraph, the Commission will issue a notice of opportunity for hearing. The hearing will be a full evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge, conducted under procedures set out in subpart B of this part, including procedures for appeal and review of initial

decisions. A final Commission order assessing a forfeiture under the provisions of this paragraph is subject to judicial review under section 402(a) of the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If, after a forfeiture penalty is imposed and not appealed or after a court enters final judgment in favor of the Commission, the forfeiture is not paid, the Commission will refer the matter to the Department of Justice for collection. In an action to recover the forfeiture, the validity and appropriateness of the order imposing the forfeiture are not subject to review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the possible assessment of a forfeiture is an issue in a hearing case to determine which pending application should be granted, and the applicant facing a potential forfeiture is dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement or otherwise, and the presiding judge has not made a determination on the forfeiture issue, the order of dismissal shall be forwarded to the attention of the full Commission. Within the time provided by Sec. 1.117, the Commission may, on its own motion, proceed with a determination of whether a forfeiture against the dismissing applicant is warranted. If the Commission so proceeds, it will provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to the forfeiture issue (see paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and make a determination under the procedures outlined in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payment. The forfeiture should be paid by check or money order drawn to the order of the Federal Communications Commission. The Commission does not accept responsibility for cash payments sent through the mails. The check or money order should be mailed to: Federal Communications Commission, P.O. Box 979088, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Remission and mitigation. In its discretion, the Commission, or its designee, may remit or reduce any forfeiture imposed under this section. After issuance of a forfeiture order, any request that it do so shall be submitted as a petition for reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 1.106.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date. Amendments to paragraph (b) of this section implementing Pub. L. No. 101-239 are effective December 19, 1989.
