                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After a review of the application for certification and any  other information which the Administrator may require, the Administrator  may approve the application and select a test fleet in accordance with  Sec. 86.094-24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disapproval of application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator may disapprove  in whole or in part an application for certification for reasons  including incompleteness, inaccuracy, inappropriate proposed mileage (or  service) accumulation procedures, test equipment, or fuel; or  incorporation of defeat devices in vehicles (or on engines) described by  the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The issuance of a certificate of conformity does not exempt the  covered vehicles from further evaluation or testing for defeat device  purposes as described in Sec. 86.094-16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where any part of an application is rejected, the Administrator  shall notify the manufacturer in writing and set forth the reasons for  such rejection. Within 30 days following receipt of such notification,  the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's  determination. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized  representative of the manufacturer and shall include a statement  specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's  determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after the  review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that  the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the  manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to  such issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval of test procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Light-duty trucks using the Standard Self-Approval durability  Program and heavy-duty engines only. The Administrator does not approve  the test procedures for establishing exhaust emission deterioration  factors for light-duty trucks using the Standard Self-Approval  Durability Program described in Sec. 86.094-13(f) nor for heavy-duty  engines. The manufacturer shall submit these procedures and  determinations as required in Sec. 86.094-21(b)(5)(i) prior to  determining the deterioration factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Parameter adjustment requirements. When the Administrator  selects emission data vehicles for the test fleet, he will at the same  time determine those vehicle or engine parameters which will be subject  to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit and  Production Compliance Audit testing, the adequacy of the limits, stops,  seals, or other means used to inhibit adjustment, and the resulting  physically adjustable ranges for each such parameter and will then  notify the manufacturer of his determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining parameters subject to adjustment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as  noted in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the Administrator may  determine to be subject to adjustment the idle fuel-air mixture  parameter on Otto-cycle vehicles (or engines) (carbureted or fuel- injected); the choke valve action parameter(s) on carbureted, Otto-cycle  vehicles (or engines); or any parameter on any vehicle (or engine)  (Otto-cycle or diesel) which is physically capable of being adjusted,  may significantly affect emissions, and was not present on the  manufacturer's vehicles (or engines) in the previous model year in the  same form and function.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator may, in addition, determine to be subject to  adjustment any other parameters on any vehicle or engine which is  physically capable of being adjusted and which may significantly affect  emissions. However, the Administrator may do so only if he has  previously notified the manufacturer that he might do so and has found,  at the time he gave this notice, that the intervening period would be  adequate to permit the development and application of the requisite  technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance  within such period. In no event will this notification be given later  than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the parameters subject to adjustment, the  Administrator will consider the likelihood that, for each of the  parameters listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section,  settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting will occur on  in-use vehicles (or engines). In determining likelihood, the  Administrator may consider such factors as, but not limited to,  information contained in the preliminary application, surveillance  information from similar in-use vehicles (or engines), the difficulty  and cost of gaining access to an adjustment, damage to the vehicle (or  engine) if an attempt is made to gain such access and the need to  replace parts following such attempt, and the effect of settings other  than the manufacturer's recommended setting on vehicle (or engine)  performance characteristics including emission characteristics.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Manual chokes of heavy-duty engines only will not be considered  a parameter subject to adjustment under the parameter adjustment  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator shall determine a parameter to be  adequately inaccessible or sealed if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of an idle mixture screw, the screw is recessed  within the carburetor casting and sealed with lead, thermosetting  plastic, or an inverted elliptical spacer or sheared off after  adjustment at the factory, and the inaccessibility is such that the  screw cannot be accessed and/or adjusted with simple tools in one-half  hour or for $20 (1978 dollars) or less;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a choke bimetal spring, the plate covering the  bimetal spring is riveted or welded in place, or   held in place with nonreversible screws;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a parameter which may be adjusted by elongating  or bending adjustable members (e.g., the choke vacuum break), the  elongation of the adjustable member is limited by design or, in the case  of a bendable member, the member is constructed of a material which when  bent would return to its original shape after the force is removed  (plastic or spring steel materials);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In the case of any parameter, the manufacturer demonstrates that  adjusting the parameter to settings other than the manufacturer's  recommended setting takes more than one-half hour or costs more than $20  (1978 dollars).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator shall determine a physical limit or stop to  be an adequate restraint on adjustability if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a threaded adjustment, the threads are  terminated, pinned, or crimped so as to prevent additional travel  without breakage or need for repairs which take more than one-half hour  or cost more than $20 (1978 dollars);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The adjustment is ineffective at the end of the limits of travel  regardless of additional forces or torques applied to the adjustment;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer demonstrates that travel or rotation limits  cannot be exceeded with the use of simple and inexpensive tools  (screwdriver, pliers, open-end or box wrenches, etc.) without incurring  significant and costly damage to the vehicle (or engine) or control  system or without taking more than one-half hour or costing more than  $20 (1978 dollars).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If manufacturer service manuals or bulletins describe routine  procedures for gaining access to a parameter or for removing or  exceeding a physical limit, stop, seal or other means used to inhibit  adjustment, or if surveillance data indicate that gaining access,  removing, or exceeding is likely, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this  section shall not apply for that parameter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In determining the adequacy of a physical limit, stop, seal, or  other means used to inhibit adjustment of a parameter not covered by  paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Administrator will  consider the likelihood that it will be circumvented, removed, or  exceeded on in-use vehicles. In determining likelihood, the  Administrator may consider such factors as, but not limited to,  information contained in the preliminary application; surveillance  information from similar in-use vehicles (or engines); the difficulty  and cost of circumventing, removing, or exceeding the limit, stop, seal,  or other means; damage to the vehicle (or engine) if an attempt is made  to circumvent, remove, or exceed it and the need to replace parts  following such attempt; and the effect of settings beyond the limit,  stop, seal, or other means on vehicle (or engine) performance  characteristics other than emission characteristics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator shall determine two physically adjustable  ranges for each parameter subject to adjustment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately  inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator may include within the  physically adjustable range applicable to testing under this subpart  (certification testing) all settings within the production tolerance  associated with the nominal setting for that parameter, as specified by  the manufacturer in the preliminary application for certification; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include  within this range all settings within physical limits or stops  determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability. The Administrator  may also include the production tolerances on the location of these  limits or stops when determining the physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately  inaccessible or sealed, the Administrator shall include within the  physically adjustable range applicable to testing under subparts G or K  (Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit) only the  actual settings to which the parameter is adjusted during production; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of other parameters, the Administrator shall include  within this range all settings within physical limits or stops  determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability, as   they are actually located on the test vehicle (or engine).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Submittal of advance information. (1) If the manufacturer  submits the information specified in Sec. 86.094-21(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> in advance  of its full preliminary application for certification, the Administrator  shall review the information and make the determinations required in  paragraph (e) of this section within 90 days of the manufacturer's  submittal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 90-day decision period is exclusive of the elapsed time  during which EPA may request additional information from manufacturers  regarding an adjustable parameter and the receipt of the manufacturers'  response(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the  Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (e) of this section,  the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's  determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized  representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement  specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's  determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review  of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the  request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the  manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.078-6 with respect to  such issue.
