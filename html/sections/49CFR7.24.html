                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each person desiring access to or a copy of a record covered by  this subpart must make a written request (via paper, facsimile or  electronic mail) for the record. The request should--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indicate that it is being made under FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display the word ``FOIA'' prominently on the envelope or on the  subject line of the email or facsimile;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be addressed to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center as  set forth in Sec. 7.27;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the format (e.g., paper, compact disc) in which the  information is sought, if the requester has a preference (see Sec.  7.26(c)); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Describe the record or records sought to the fullest extent  possible. In this regard, the request should describe the subject matter  of the record and, if known, indicate the date when it was made, the  place where it was made, and the individual or office that made it. If  the description does not enable the office handling the request to  identify or locate the record sought, that office will contact the  requester for additional information. So that the office may contact the  requester for additional information, the request should provide the  requester's complete contact information, including name, address,  telephone number, and email address, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to fees, the request must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify the fee category (commercial use, news media,  educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or other;  see Sec. 7.42(g)) in which the requester claims the request falls and  the basis of this claim (see subpart E of this Part for fees and fee  waiver requirements);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Support any request for fee waiver by addressing, to the fullest  extent possible, how the criteria set out in Sec. 7.43(c) for  establishing that the request is in the public interest have been met,  if relevant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State the maximum amount of fees that the requester is willing  to pay and/or include a request for a fee waiver or reduction (if a  maximum amount is not stated by the requester, DOT will assume the  requester is willing to pay up to US $25);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A request is not considered to be a FOIA request if the record  or records sought are insufficiently described such that DOT is unable  to respond as required by FOIA. The twenty Federal working day limit for  responding to requests, described in Sec. 7.31(a)(2), will not   start to run until the request is determined by DOT to be sufficiently  understood to enable DOT to respond as contemplated under FOIA (or would  have been so determined with the exercise of due diligence by an  employee of DOT) and is considered received (see paragraph (e)); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provided the request is considered to be a FOIA request (see  paragraph (d)), the request is considered received when it is first  received by the FOIA office to which it should have been originally  sent, as shown in Sec. 7.27, but in any event not later than ten  Federal working days after it is first received by any DOT FOIA  Requester Service Center identified in Sec. 7.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As provided in Sec. 7.35, DOT's time limit for responding to a  FOIA request as set forth in subpart D may be tolled one time to seek  additional information needed to clarify the request and as often as  necessary to clarify fee issues with the requester.</p>
