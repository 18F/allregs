                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or  Treasury bills of any series (not including interim receipts issued by  Federal reserve banks in lieu of definitive certificates, notes, or  bills) may be tendered at or before maturity in payment of internal  revenue taxes due on the date (or in payment for stamps purchased on the  date), on which the certificates, notes, or bills mature, or in payment  of internal revenue taxes due on a specified prior date, but only if  such certificates, notes, or bills, according to the express terms of  their issue, are made acceptable in payment of such taxes or for the  purchase of stamps. If the taxes for which the certificates, notes, or  bills are tendered in payment become due, or the stamps are purchased,  on the same date as that on which such certificates, notes, or bills  mature, they will be accepted at par plus accrued interest, if any,  payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached) in  payment of such taxes or stamps. If the taxes for which the  certificates, notes, or bills are tendered in payment become due, or the  stamps are purchased, on a date prior to that on which the certificates,  notes, or bills mature, they will be accepted at the value specified in  the terms under which such certificates, notes, or bills were issued.  All interest coupons attached to Treasury certificates of indebtedness  or Treasury notes shall be detached by the taxpayer before such  certificates or notes are tendered in payment of taxes or stamps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receipts given by a district director for Treasury certificates  of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills received in payment  of internal revenue taxes or for stamps as provided in this section  shall contain an adequate description of such certificates, notes, or  bills, and a statement of the value, including accrued interest, if any,  payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached), at  which accepted, and shall show that the certificates, notes, or bills  are tendered by the taxpayer and received by the district director,  subject to no conditions, qualification, or reservation whatsoever, in  payment of an amount of taxes or for stamps no greater than such value.  Any certificate, note, or bill offered in payment of internal revenue  taxes or for stamps subject to any condition, qualification, or  reservation, or for any greater amount than the value at which  acceptable in payment of taxes or stamps, as specified in   the terms under which such certificate, note, or bill was issued, shall  not be deemed to be duly tendered and shall be returned to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of saving taxpayers the expense of transmitting  Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills  to the office of the district director in whose district the taxes are  payable, or stamps are to be purchased, taxpayers desiring to pay taxes,  or purchase stamps, with such certificates, notes, or bills acceptable  in payment of taxes or for the purchase of stamps may deposit such  certificates, notes, or bills with a Federal reserve bank or branch, or  with the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, Treasury  Building, Washington, D.C. In such cases, the Federal reserve bank or  branch, or the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, shall issue  a receipt in the name of the district director, describing the  certificates, notes, or bills by par or dollar face amount and stating  on the face of the receipt that the certificates, notes, or bills  represented thereby are held by the bank or branch, or the Office of the  Treasurer of the United States, for redemption at the value specified in  the terms under which the certificates, notes, or bills were issued, and  for application of the proceeds in payment of taxes due or for the  purchase of stamps on a specified date by the taxpayer named therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of payments of tax required to be deposited with  Government depositaries by regulations under section 6302 of the Code,  certificates, notes, or bills referred to in paragraph (a) of this  section may be deposited with a Federal Reserve bank or branch, or with  the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, in part or full  satisfaction of such tax liability.

In such cases,  notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, receipts for  such certificates, notes or bills shall no longer be issued in the name  of the district director.</p>
