                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ``Contractor'' as including ``subcontractor.'' Except where  otherwise noted or where the term Government prime contractor is used,  the term contractor as used in this part 4 shall be deemed to include a  subcontractor. The term contractor as used in the contract clauses  required by subpart A in any subcontract under a covered contract shall  be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, or, if in a subcontract entered  into by such a subcontractor, shall be deemed to refer to the lower  level subcontractor. (See Sec. 4.1a(f).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liability of prime contractor. When a contractor undertakes a  contract subject to the Act, the contractor agrees to assume the  obligation that the Act's labor standards will be observed in furnishing  the required services. This obligation may not be relieved by shifting  all or part of the work to another, and the prime contractor is jointly  and severally liable with any subcontractor for any underpayments on the  part of a subcontractor which would constitute a violation of the prime  contract. The prime contractor is required to include the prescribed  contract clauses (Sec. Sec. 4.6-4.7) and applicable wage determination  in all subcontracts. The appropriate enforcement sanctions provided  under the Act may be invoked against both the prime contractor and the  subcontractor in the event of failure to comply with any of the Act's  requirements where appropriate under the circumstances of the case.</p><p class="depth2">Specific Exclusions</p>
