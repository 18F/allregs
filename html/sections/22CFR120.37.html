                            <p class="depth0">Foreign ownership means more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the firm are owned by one or more foreign persons (as defined in Sec. 120.16). Foreign control means one or more foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish or direct the general policies or day-to-day operations of the firm. Foreign control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities unless one U.S. person controls an equal or larger percentage.
