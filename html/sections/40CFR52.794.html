Applicability of this regulation to these sources is being disapproved because 325 IAC 5-1 does not meet the enforceability requirements of Sec. 51.22 as it applies to these sources. Opacity limits in 325 IAC 6-1-10.2 and certain opacity limits in 325 IAC 11-3 supersede those in 325 IAC 5-1, and USEPA has previously disapproved these superseding regulations (Sec. 52.776 (j), (g), and (f), respectively).
