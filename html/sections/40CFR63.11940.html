You must monitor, record,  and calculate CPMS data averages as specified in Table 7 to this  subpart. Paragraph (h) of this section provides an option to propose  alternative monitoring parameters or procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flow indicator. If flow to a control device could be  intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator  at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no  flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a thermal oxidizer other than a catalytic thermal oxidizer is  used, you must install a temperature monitoring device in the fire box  or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the fire box in a position  before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, where a  catalytic thermal oxidizer is used, you must install temperature  monitoring devices in the gas stream immediately before and after the  catalyst bed. You must monitor the temperature differential across the  catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must conduct annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst  activity (i.e., conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or  catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. If problems are found during  the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take  other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's  recommendations within 15 days or by the next time any process vent  stream is collected by the control device, whichever is sooner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must conduct annual internal inspections of the catalyst  bed to check for fouling, plugging, or mechanical breakdown. You must  also inspect the bed for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems  are found during the annual internal inspection of the catalyst, you  must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent  with the manufacturer's recommendations within 15 days or by the next  time any process vent stream is collected by the control device,  whichever is later. If the catalyst bed is replaced and is not of like  or better kind and quality as the old catalyst then you must conduct a  new performance test according to Sec. 63.11945 to determine destruction  efficiency. If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst  is of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then a   new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not  required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A flow meter to monitor the absorber or acid gas scrubber  influent liquid flow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, (B), or (C) of this section.

For regeneration cycles longer  than 1 week, you must perform the measurement over the last 5 minutes of  each adsorption cycle for each carbon bed. The outlet concentration of  volatile organic compounds must be measured using a portable analyzer,  in accordance with Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, for open- ended lines. Alternatively, outlet concentration of HAP(s) may be  measured using chromatographic analysis using Method 18 at 40 CFR part  60, appendix A-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, of the first adsorber bed in  series until breakthrough occurs for the first three adsorber bed  change-outs.

Alternatively,  outlet concentration of HAP may be measured using chromatographic  analysis using Method 18 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6. Breakthrough  of the bed is defined as the time when the level of HAP detected is at  the highest concentration allowed to be discharged from the adsorber  system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this  section, conduct daily monitoring of the adsorber bed outlet volatile  organic compound or HAP concentration, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may conduct monthly monitoring if the adsorbent has more  than 2 months of life remaining, as determined by the average primary  adsorber bed life, established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and  the date the adsorbent was last replaced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may conduct weekly monitoring if the adsorbent has more  than 2 weeks of life remaining, as determined by the average primary  adsorber bed life, established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and  the date the adsorbent was last replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, ``immediately'' means within 8 hours  of the detection of a   breakthrough for adsorbers of 55 gallons or less, and within 24 hours of  the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers greater than 55 gallons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In lieu of replacing the first adsorber immediately, you may  elect to monitor the outlet of the second canister beginning on the day  the breakthrough between the first and second canister is identified and  each day thereafter. This daily monitoring must continue until the first  canister is replaced.
