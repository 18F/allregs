The event, which is one week or less in duration,  generally occurs during the last week of July or the first two weeks of  August. The Captain of the Port will provide notice of the enforcement  of this special local regulation by Notice of Enforcement in the Federal  Register. Additional information may be available through Broadcast  Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The area where the Coast Guard will restrict general navigation  by this regulation during the hours it is in effect is: The waters of  Lake Washington bounded by the Interstate 90 (Mercer Island /Lacey V.  Murrow) Bridge, the western shore of Lake Washington, and the east/west  line drawn tangent to Bailey Peninsula and along the shoreline of Mercer  Island.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The area described in paragraph (b) of this section has been  divided into two zones. The zones are separated by a line perpendicular  from the I-90 Bridge to the northwest corner of the East log boom and a  line extending from the southeast corner of the East log boom to the  southeast corner of the hydroplane race course and then to the northerly  tip of Ohlers Island in Andrews Bay. The western zone is designated Zone  I, the eastern zone, Zone II. (Refer to NOAA Chart 18447).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Coast Guard will maintain a patrol consisting of Coast Guard  vessels, assisted by Auxiliary Coast Guard vessels, in Zone II. The  Coast Guard patrol of this area is under the direction of the Coast  Guard Patrol Commander (the ``Patrol Commander''). The Patrol Commander  is empowered to control the movement of vessels on the racecourse and in  the adjoining waters during the periods this regulation is in effect.  The Patrol Commander may be assisted by other federal, state and local  law enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Only authorized vessels may be allowed to enter Zone I during  the hours this regulation is in effect. Vessels in the vicinity of Zone  I shall maneuver and anchor as directed by Coast Guard Officers or Petty  Officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> During the times in which the regulation is in effect, swimming,  wading, or otherwise entering the water in Zone I by any person is  prohibited while hydroplane boats are on the racecourse. At other times  in Zone I, any person entering the water from the shoreline shall remain  west of the swim line, denoted by buoys, and any person entering the  water from the log boom shall remain within ten (10) feet of the log  boom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> During the times in which the regulation is in effect, any  person swimming or otherwise entering the water in Zone II shall remain  within ten (10) feet of a vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> During the times this regulation is in effect, rafting to a log  boom will be limited to groups of three vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> During the times this regulation is in effect, up to six (6)  vessels may raft together in Zone II if none of the vessels are secured  to a log boom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> During the times this regulation is in effect, only vessels  authorized by the Patrol Commander, other law enforcement agencies or  event sponsors shall be permitted to tow other watercraft or inflatable  devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Vessels proceeding in either Zone I or Zone II during the hours  this regulation is in effect shall do so only at speeds which will  create minimum wake, seven (07) miles per hour or less. This maximum  speed may be reduced at the discretion of the Patrol Commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Upon completion of the daily racing activities, all vessels  leaving either Zone I or Zone II shall proceed at speeds of seven (07)  miles per hour or less. The maximum speed may be reduced at the  discretion of the Patrol Commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from  vessels patrolling the areas under the direction of the Patrol Commander  shall serve as signal to stop. Vessels signaled shall stop and shall  comply with the orders of the patrol vessel; failure to do so may result  in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both. The  Coast Guard may be assisted by other federal, state and local law  enforcement agencies, as well as official Seafair event craft.
