                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The effectiveness of an individual in meeting security responsibilities is proportional to the degree to which the individual understands them. Thus, an integral part of the DoD security program is the indoctrination of individuals on their security responsibilities. Moreover, such indoctrination is essential to the efficient functioning of the DoD personnel security program. Accordingly, heads of DoD Components shall establish procedures in accordance with this chapter whereby persons requiring access to classified information, or being assigned to positions that require the occupants to be determined trustworthy are periodically briefed as to their security responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial briefing. (1) All persons cleared for access to classified information or assigned to duties requiring a trustworthiness determination under this part shall be given an initial security briefing. The briefing shall be in accordance with the requirements of 32 CFR part 159 and consist of the following elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All persons cleared for access to classified information or assigned to duties requiring a trustworthiness determination under this part shall be given an initial security briefing. The briefing shall be in accordance with the requirements of 32 CFR part 159 and consist of the following elements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific security requirements of their particular job.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The techniques employed by foreign intelligence activities in attempting to obtain classified information and their responsibility for reporting such attempts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The prohibition against disclosing classified information, by any means, to unauthorized persons or discussing or handling classified information in a manner that would make it accessible to unauthorized persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The penalties that may be imposed for security violations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an individual declines to execute Standard Form 312, ``Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement'' (replaced the Standard Form 189), the DoD Component shall initiate action to deny or revoke the security clearance of such person in accordance with Sec. 154.56(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refresher briefing. Programs shall be established to provide, at a minimum, annual security training for personnel having continued access to classified information. The elements outlined in 32 CFR part 159 shall be tailored to fit the needs of experienced personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign travel briefing. While world events during the past several years have diminished the threat to our national security from traditional cold-war era foreign intelligence services, foreign intelligence service continue to pursue the unauthorized acquisition of classified or otherwise sensitive U.S. Government information, through the recruitment of U.S. Government employees with access to such information. Through security briefings and education, the Department of Defense continues to provide for the protection of information and technology considered vital to the national security interests from illegal or unauthorized acquisition by foreign intelligence services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DoD Components will establish appropriate internal procedures requiring all personnel possessing a DoD security clearance to report to their security office all contacts with individuals of any nationality, whether within or outside the scope of the employee's official activities, in which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Illegal or unauthorized access is sought to classified or otherwise sensitive information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee is concerned that he or she may be the target of exploitation by a foreign entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DoD security manager, security specialist or other qualified individual will review and evaluate the reported information. Any facts or circumstances of a reported contact with a foreign national that appear to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Indicate an attempt or intention to obtain unauthorized access to proprietary, sensitive, or classified information or technology;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Offer a reasonable potential for such; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate the possibility of continued contact with the foreign national for such purposes, shall be promptly reported to the appropriate counterintelligence agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination briefing. (1) Upon termination of employment administrative withdrawal of security clearance, or contemplated absence from duty or employment for 60 days or more, DoD military personnel and civilian employees shall be given a termination briefing, return all classified material, and execute a Security Termination Statement. This statement shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon termination of employment administrative withdrawal of security clearance, or contemplated absence from duty or employment for 60 days or more, DoD military personnel and civilian employees shall be given a termination briefing, return all classified material, and execute a Security Termination Statement. This statement shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An acknowledgment that the individual has read the appropriate provisions of the Espionage Act, other criminal statutes, DoD Regulations applicable to the safeguarding of classified information to which the individual has had access, and understands the implications thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A declaration that the individual no longer has any documents or material containing classified information in his or her possession;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An acknowledgment that the individual will not communicate or transmit classified information to any unauthorized person or agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An acknowledgment that the individual will report without delay to the FBI or the DoD Component concerned any attempt by any unauthorized person to solicit classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an individual refuses to execute a Security Termination Statement, that fact shall be reported immediately to the security manager of the cognizant organization concerned. In any such case, the individual involved shall be debriefed orally. The fact of a refusal to sign a Security Termination Statement shall be reported to the Director, Defense Investigative Service who shall ensure that it is recorded in the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Security Termination Statement shall be retained by the DoD Component that authorized the individual access to classified information for the period specified in the Component's records retention schedules, but for a minimum of 2 years after the individual is given a termination briefing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section, DoD Components shall establish a central authority to be responsible for ensuring that Security Termination Statements are executed by senior personnel (general officers, flag officers and GS-16s and above). Failure on the part of such personnel to execute a Security Termination Statement shall be reported immediately to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.
