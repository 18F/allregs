                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Report of infraction. Each mail handling irregularity will be  reported in the prescribed format by the cognizant postal official or  designated representative. As soon as possible the reporting authority  will ask the local representative of the air carrier to provide an  explanation of the irregularity. A summary of the explanation, if any,  will be entered in the record. A copy of the report will be provided to  the local station manager of the air carrier concerned at the close of  each tour or not less frequently than each 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Carrier conferences. At least one a month, postal officials will  schedule meetings with the local representatives of the affected air  carriers to discuss the reported irregularities. The carrier's  representative will be advised of any irregularity for which the  reporting authority will recommend penalty action. The carrier's  representative will be offered the opportunity to comment on any  irregularity, and any comments will be attached and/or be made part of  the record. The reports on which penalty action is recommended will then  be processed by International Network Operations, Postal Headquarters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review, investigation, penalty action. International Network  Operations will review the matter and advise the carrier of the  recommendations. The carrier has 21 days from receipt of notice to  dispute the recommended penalties. In those instances which the carrier  has disputed the facts alleged by the reporting authority, International  Network Operations will investigate the matter to resolve the  differences. International Network Operations, upon review of the  record, may impose a fine or penalty against an air carrier for any  irregularity properly documented, whether or not penalty action has been  recommended. International Network Operations will send the decision,  including notice of the irregularities alleged and the amount of fine or  penalty proposed to the carrier. The Postal Service may, in its  discretion, deduct from payment otherwise due the air carrier an amount  necessary to satisfy the penalty action taken under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appeal. If the final decision includes a penalty, International  Network Operations will advise the carrier that it may, within 30 days,  appeal the action in writing to the Vice President, Network Operations  Management, Postal Headquarters, and that its written appeal should  include all facts and arguments upon which the carrier relies in support  of the appeal. If an appeal is not received, International Network  Operations will close the file. When an appeal is taken, the Vice  President, Network Operations Management, will review the complete  record and decide the appeals. He will advise the carrier of the  decision in writing and will take action consistent with that decision.  The Vice President, Network Operations Management, may sustain, rescind,  or compromise a fine or penalty. The decision of the Vice President,  Network Operations Management, on appeal shall be the final decision of  the Postal Service. The Postal Service, may, in its discretion, deduct  from pay otherwise due the air carrier an amount necessary to satisfy  the penalty action taken under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Details of administration.
