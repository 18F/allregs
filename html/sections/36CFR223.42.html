                            <p class="depth0">The Forest Service may permit transfer of unused effective purchaser credit earned after December 16, 1975, from one timber sale account to another timber sale account of the same purchaser within the same National Forest, provided the sale contracts provide procedures for the use of purchaser credit. Approval for transfer shall not be granted for amounts needed to satisfy unfulfilled payment obligations or claims for damages due the United States. Purchaser credit transferred under this paragraph is subject to such additional restrictions as may be necessary for its orderly use.
