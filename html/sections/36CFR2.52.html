                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Printed Matter. The term ``printed matter'' means message- bearing textual printed material such as books, pamphlets, magazines,  and leaflets, provided that it is not solely commercial advertising.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permits and the small group permit exception. The sale or  distribution of printed matter is allowed within park areas designated  as available under Sec. 2.51(c)(2) when the superintendent has issued a  permit for the activity, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sale or distribution activity by 25 persons or fewer may be  conducted without a permit within designated park areas, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> None of the reasons for denying a permit that are set out in  paragraph (e) of this section are present;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The group is not merely an extension of another group already  availing itself of the small group permit exception under this  provision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sale or distribution will not unreasonably interfere with  other permitted demonstrations and special events, or program  activities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Hand-carried signs may be used, but stages, platforms, or  structures may not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> While it is not mandatory, the organizer is requested to provide  reasonable notice of the proposed event to the park superintendent,  including whether there is any reason to believe that there may be an  attempt to disrupt, protest, or prevent the activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The 25-person maximum for the small group permit exception may  be reduced for a designated available area, but only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A written determination that a 25-person group cannot be  reasonably physically accommodated within that area is approved by the  regional director; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The written determination is made available at the office of  the superintendent and by public notice under Sec. 1.7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that two or more groups taking advantage of the  small group permit exception seek to use the same designated available  area at the same time, and the area cannot reasonably accommodate  multiple occupancy, the superintendent will, whenever possible, direct  the later arriving group to relocate to another nearby designated  available area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application for permit. An application must provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the applicant or the name of the organization (if  any);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date, time, duration, nature, and place of the proposed  event;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the number of persons expected to attend;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of equipment and facilities to be used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether there is any reason to believe that there will be an  attempt to   disrupt, protest, or prevent the event; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other information required by the permit application form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The superintendent must not accept an application more than one  year before the proposed event (including time required for set-up);  applications received more than a year in advance will be returned to  the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Processing the application. The superintendent must issue a  permit or a written denial within ten days of receiving a complete and  fully executed application. A permit will be approved unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The superintendent has granted or will grant a prior application  for a permit for the same time and place, and the activities authorized  by that permit do not reasonably allow multiple occupancy of the  particular area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It reasonably appears that the sale or distribution will present  a clear and present danger to the public health and safety;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of persons engaged in the sale or distribution  exceeds the number that can reasonably be accommodated in the particular  location applied for, considering such things as damage to park  resources or facilities, impairment of a protected area's atmosphere of  peace and tranquility, interference with program activities, or  impairment of public use facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The location applied for has not been designated as available  under Sec. 2.51(c)(2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The application was submitted more than one year before the  proposed event (including set-up); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The activity would constitute a violation of an applicable law  or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Written denial of permit. If a permit is denied, the  superintendent will inform the applicant in writing of the denial and  the reasons for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Permit conditions. The permit may contain conditions reasonably  consistent with the requirements of public health and safety, protection  of park resources, and the use of the park area for the purposes for  which it was established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Permit duration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permits may be issued for a maximum of 14  consecutive days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A permit may be extended for up to 14 days, but a new  application must be submitted for each extension requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extension may be denied if another applicant has requested  use of the same location and the location cannot reasonably accommodate  multiple occupancy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Misrepresentation. It is prohibited for persons engaged in the  sale or distribution of printed matter under this section to  misrepresent the purposes or affiliations of those engaged in the sale  or distribution, or to misrepresent whether the printed matter is  available without cost or donation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Violation prohibited. Violation of these regulations or the  terms of the permit is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Permit revocation, termination of small group exception. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  superintendent may revoke a permit for any violation of its terms and  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The superintendent may revoke a permit, or order a small group  permit exception activity to cease, when any of the conditions listed in  paragraph (e) of this section exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The superintendent will make the revocation or order to cease in  writing, with the reasons clearly set forth. In emergency circumstances  the superintendent will make an immediate verbal revocation or order to  cease, followed by written confirmation within 72 hours.
