                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. This section describes a verification  procedure for system response and updating-recording frequency for  continuous gas analyzers that output a single gas species mole fraction  (i.e., concentration) based on a continuous combination of multiple gas  species measured with multiple detectors (i.e., gas analyzers  continuously compensated for other gas species). See Sec.  1065.308 for  verification procedures that apply to continuous gas analyzers that are  not continuously compensated for other gas species or that use only one  detector for gaseous species. Perform this verification to determine the  system response of the continuous gas analyzer and its sampling system.  This verification is required for continuous gas analyzers used for  transient or ramped-modal testing. You need not perform this  verification for batch gas analyzers or for continuous gas analyzers  that are used only for discrete-mode testing. For this check we consider  water vapor a gaseous constituent. This verification does not apply to  any processing of individual analyzer signals that are time-aligned to  their t50 times and were verified according to Sec.   1065.308. For example, this verification does not apply to correction  for water removed from the sample done in post-processing according to  Sec.  1065.659 (40 CFR 1066.620 for vehicle testing) and it does not  apply to NMHC determination from THC and CH4 according to  Sec.  1065.660. Perform this verification after initial installation  (i.e., test cell commissioning) and after any modifications to the  system that would change the system response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement principles. This procedure verifies that the  updating and recording frequencies match the overall system response to  a rapid change in the value of concentrations at the sample probe. It  indirectly verifies the time-alignment and uniform response of all the  continuous gas detectors used to generate a continuously combined/ compensated concentration measurement signal. Gas analyzer systems must  be optimized such that their overall response to rapid change in  concentration is updated and recorded at an appropriate frequency to  prevent loss of information. This test also verifies that the  measurement system meets a minimum response time. For this procedure,  ensure that all compensation algorithms and humidity corrections are  turned on. You may use the results of this test to determine  transformation time, t50, for the purposes of time alignment  of continuous data in accordance with Sec.  1065.650(c)(2)(i). You may  also use an alternate procedure to determine t50 consistent  with good engineering judgment. Note that any such procedure for  determining t50 must account for both transport delay and  analyzer response time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System requirements. Demonstrate that each continuously  combined/compensated concentration measurement has adequate updating and  recording frequencies and has a minimum rise time and a minimum fall  time during a system response to a rapid change in multiple gas  concentrations, including H2O concentration if H2O  compensation is applied. You must meet one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The product of the mean rise time, t10-90, and the  frequency at which the system records an updated concentration must be  at least 5, and the product of the mean fall time, t90-10,  and the frequency at which the system records an updated concentration  must be at least 5. If the recording frequency is different than the  update frequency of the continuously combined/compensated signal, you  must use the lower of these two frequencies for this verification. This  criterion makes no assumption regarding the frequency content of changes  in emission concentrations during emission testing; therefore, it is  valid for any testing. Also, the mean rise time must be at or below 10  seconds and the mean fall time must be at or below 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The frequency at which the system records an updated  concentration must be at least 5 Hz. This criterion assumes that the  frequency content of significant changes in emission concentrations  during emission testing do not exceed 1 Hz. Also, the mean rise   time must be at or below 10 seconds and the mean fall time must be at or  below 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may use other criteria if we approve them in advance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may meet the overall PEMS verification in Sec.  1065.920  instead of the verification in this section for field testing with PEMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure. Use the following procedure to verify the response of  each continuously compensated analyzer (verify the combined signal, not  each individual continuously combined concentration signal):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instrument setup. Follow the analyzer manufacturer's start-up  and operating instructions. Adjust the measurement system as needed to  optimize performance. Run this verification with the analyzer operating  in the same manner you will use for emission testing. If the analyzer  shares its sampling system with other analyzers, and if gas flow to the  other analyzers will affect the system response time, then start up and  operate the other analyzers while running this verification test. You  may run this verification test on multiple analyzers sharing the same  sampling system at the same time. If you use any analog or real-time  digital filters during emission testing, you must operate those filters  in the same manner during this verification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. If you are humidifying span gases  without NO2, use good engineering judgment to ensure that the  wall temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the  humidifying system to the probe are above the dewpoint required for the  target H2O content. If you are humidifying span gases with  NO2, use good engineering judgment to ensure that there is no  condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point  where humidified gas is mixed with NO2 span gas to the probe.  We recommend that you design your   setup so that the wall temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and  valves from the humidifying system to the probe are at least 5 [deg]C  above the local sample gas dewpoint. Operate the measurement and sample  handling system as you do for emission testing. Make no modifications to  the sample handling system to reduce the risk of condensation. Flow  humidified gas through the sampling system before this check to allow  stabilization of the measurement system's sampling handling system to  occur, as it would for an emission test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data collection. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Start the flow of zero gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allow for stabilization, accounting for transport delays and  the slowest analyzer's full response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Start recording data. For this verification you must record  data at a frequency greater than or equal to that of the updating- recording frequency used during emission testing. You may not use  interpolation or filtering to alter the recorded values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Switch the flow to allow the blended span gases to flow to the  analyzer. If you intend to use the data from this test to determine  t50 for time alignment, record this time as t0.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Allow for transport delays and the slowest analyzer's full  response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Switch the flow to allow zero gas to flow to the analyzer. If  you intend to use the data from this test to determine t50  for time alignment, record this time as t100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Allow for transport delays and the slowest analyzer's full  response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) through (vii) of  this section to record seven full cycles, ending with zero gas flowing  to the analyzers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Stop recording.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Performance evaluations. (1) If you choose to demonstrate  compliance with paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, use the data from  paragraph (d)(3) of this section to calculate the mean rise time,  t10-90, and mean fall time, t90-10, for the  continuously combined signal from each analyzer being verified. You may  use interpolation between recorded values to determine rise and fall  times. If the recording frequency used during emission testing is  different from the analyzer's output update frequency, you must use the  lower of these two frequencies for this verification. Multiply these  times (in seconds) by their respective updating-recording frequencies in  Hz (1/second). The resulting product must be at least 5 for both rise  time and fall time. If either value is less than 5, increase the  updating-recording frequency or adjust the flows or design of the  sampling system to increase the rise time and fall time as needed. You  may also configure analog or digital filters before recording to  increase rise and fall times. In no case may the mean rise time or mean  fall time be greater than 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a measurement system fails the criterion in paragraph (e)(1)  of this section, ensure that signals from the system are updated and  recorded at a frequency of at least 5 Hz. In no case may the mean rise  time or mean fall time be greater than 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a measurement system fails the criteria in paragraphs (e)(1)  and (2) of this section, you may use the measurement system only if the  deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to show compliance  with the applicable standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transformation time, t50, determination. If you  choose to determine t50 for purposes of time alignment using  data generated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, calculate the mean  t0-50 and the mean t100-50 from the recorded data.  Average these two values to determine the final t50 for the  purposes of time alignment in accordance with Sec.  1065.650(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>, noting that you may use compensating gases mixed with  ambient air for oxygen analyzers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>. If an analyzer compensates only for H2O, you  may apply the requirements of Sec.  1065.308 instead of the requirements  of this section. You may omit humidifying the span gas if you meet the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The analyzer is located downstream of a sample dryer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum value for H2O mole fraction downstream of  the dryer must be less than or equal to 0.010. Verify this during each  sample dryer verification according to Sec.  1065.342.
