In this situation, the  party responsible for verification of the equipment is not required to  retain a duplicate copy of the description of the measurement  facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No specific site calibration data is required for equipment  that is   verified for compliance based on measurements performed at the  installation site of the equipment.

The Commission will make publicly available a  list of those laboratories that have indicated a willingness to perform  testing for the general public. Inclusion of a facility on the  Commission's list does not constitute Commission endorsement of that  facility. In order to be included on this list, the accrediting  organization (or Designating Authority in the case of foreign  laboratories) must submit the information listed below to the  Commission's laboratory:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Laboratory name, location of test site(s), mailing address and  contact information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name of accrediting organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scope of laboratory accreditation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Date of expiration of accreditation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Designation number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> FCC Registration Number (FRN);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A statement as to whether or not the laboratory performs testing  on a contract basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For laboratories outside the United States, the name of the  mutual recognition agreement or arrangement under which the  accreditation of the laboratory is recognized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other information as requested by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the measurement method used requires the testing of  radiated emissions on a validated test site, the site attenuation must  comply with the requirements of Sections 5.4.4 through 5.5 of the  following procedure: ANSI C63.4-2014 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 2.910). Measurement facilities used to make radiated emission  measurements from 30 MHz to 1 GHz shall comply with the site validation  requirements in ANSI C63.4-2014 (clause 5.4.4) and for radiated emission  measurements from 1 GHz to 40 GHz shall comply with the site validation  requirement of ANSI C63.4-2014 (clause 5.5.1 a) 1)), such that the site  validation criteria called out in CISPR 16-1-4:2010-04 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 2.910) is met.

Such a  laboratory shall be accredited by a Commission recognized accreditation  organization based on the International Organization for  Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission International  Standard ISO/IEC 17025, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 2.910). The  organization accrediting the laboratory must be recognized by the  Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology, as indicated in  Sec. 0.241 of this chapter, to perform such accreditation based on  International Standard ISO/IEC 17011 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 2.910).
