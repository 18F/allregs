                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be qualifying, and thus enforceable against the TSP, a  retirement benefits court order must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The order must expressly relate to the Thrift Savings Plan  account of a TSP participant. This means that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The order must expressly refer to the ``Thrift Savings Plan'' or  describe the TSP in such a way that it cannot be confused with other  Federal Government retirement benefits or non-Federal retirement  benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The order must be written in terms appropriate to a defined  contribution plan rather than a defined benefit plan. For example, it  should generally refer to the participant's TSP account or TSP account  balance rather than a benefit formula or the participant's eventual  benefits; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the participant has a civilian TSP account and a uniformed  services TSP account, the order must expressly identify the account to  which it relates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The order must either require the TSP to freeze the  participant's account to preserve the status quo pending final  resolution of the parties' rights to the participant's TSP account, or  to make a payment from the participant's account to a permissible payee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the order requires a payment from the participant's account,  the award must be for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A specific dollar amount;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A stated percentage or fraction of the account; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A survivor annuity as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The following examples would qualify to require payment from  the TSP, although ambiguous or conflicting language used elsewhere could  cause the order to be rejected.</p><p class="depth4">Example (1). ORDERED: [payee's name, Social Security number (SSN),  and address] is awarded $____ from the [civilian or uniformed services]  Thrift Savings Plan account of [participant's name, account number or  SSN, and address].</p><p class="depth4">Example (2). ORDERED: [payee's name, SSN, and address] is awarded  ____% of the [civilian and/or uniformed services] Thrift Savings Plan  account[s] of [participant's name, account number or SSN, and address]  as of [date].</p><p class="depth4">Example (3). ORDERED: [payee's name, SSN, and address] is awarded  [fraction] of the [civilian and/or uniformed services] Thrift Savings  Plan account[s] of [participant's name, account number or SSN, and  address] as of [date].</p><p class="depth4">Note: The following optional language can be used in conjunction  with any of the above examples. FURTHER ORDERED: Earnings will be paid  on the amount of the entitlement under this ORDER until payment is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A court order can require a payment only to a spouse, former  spouse, child or dependent of a participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following retirement benefits court orders are not  qualifying and thus are not enforceable against the TSP:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An order relating to a TSP account that has been closed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An order relating to a TSP account that contains only nonvested  money, unless the money will become vested within 30 days of the date  the TSP receives the order if the participant were to remain in  Government service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An order requiring the return to the TSP of money that was  properly paid pursuant to an earlier court order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An order requiring the TSP to make a payment in the future,  unless the present value of the payee's entitlement can be calculated,  in which case the TSP will make the payment currently; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An order that does not specify the account to which the order  applies, if the participant has both a civilian TSP account and a  uniformed services TSP account; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An order that requires the TSP to calculate the payee's  entitlement or earnings in a manner that is inconsistent with  Sec. 1653.4 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An order that designates the TSP Fund, source of contributions,  or balance (e.g., traditional, Roth, or tax-exempt) from which the  payment or portions of the payment shall be made.
