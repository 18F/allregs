                            <p class="depth0">Management and operating contracts shall contain an organizational  conflict of interest clause substantially similar to the clause at  952.209-72, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, and which is  appropriate to the statement of work of the individual contract. In  addition, the contracting officer shall assure that the clause contains  appropriate restraints on intra-corporate relations between the  contractor's organization and personnel operating the Department's  facility and its parent corporate body and affiliates. Such restraints  shall include personnel access to the facility, technical transfer of  information from the facility, and the availability from the facility of  other advantages flowing from performance of the contract. The  contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that M&O; contractors  adopt policies and procedures in the award of subcontracts that will  meet the Department's need to safeguard against a biased work product  and an unfair competitive advantage. To this end, the organizational  conflicts of interest clause in management and operating contracts shall  include Alternate I.  [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36371, July 22, 2009]</p>
