                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise provided in an agreement, benefits  will be computed in accordance with this section. Benefits payable under  an agreement are based on a pro rata primary insurance amount (PIA),  which we determine as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We establish a theoretical earnings record for a worker which  attributes to all computation base years (see Secs. 404.211(b) and  404.241(c)) the same relative earnings position (REP) as he or she has  in the years of his or her actual U.S. covered work. As explained in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the REP is derived by determining the  ratio of the worker's actual U.S. covered earnings in each year to the  average of the total U.S. covered wages of all workers for that year,  and then averaging the ratios for all such years. This average is the  REP and is expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> We compute a theoretical PIA as prescribed in Sec. 404.1918(c)  based on the theoretical earnings record and the provisions of subpart C  of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We multiply the theoretical PIA by a fraction equal to the  number of quarters of coverage (QC's) which the worker completed under  the U.S. Social Security system over the number of calendar quarters in  the worker's coverage lifetime (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).  See Sec. 404.140 for the definition of QC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the pro rata PIA is higher than the PIA which would be  computed if   the worker were insured under the U.S. system without totalization, the  pro rata PIA will be reduced to the later PIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Establishing a theoretical earnings record. (1) To establish a  worker's theoretical earnings record, we divide his or her U.S. earnings  in each year credited with at least one U.S. QC by the average of the  total wages of all workers for that year and express the quotient as a  percentage. For the years 1937 through 1950, the average of the total  wages is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Average of</p><p class="depth0">the total</p><p class="depth0">Year                               wages of</p><p class="depth0">all workers ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1937.......................................................    $1,137.96 1938.......................................................     1,053.24 1939.......................................................     1,142.36 1940.......................................................     1,195.00 1941.......................................................     1,276.04 1942.......................................................     1,454.28 1943.......................................................     1,713.52 1944.......................................................     1,936.32 1945.......................................................     2,021.40 1946.......................................................     1,891.76 1947.......................................................     2,175.32 1948.......................................................     2,361.64 1949.......................................................     2,483.20 1950.......................................................     2,543.96 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For years after 1950, the average of the total wages is as  prescribed in Sec. 404.211(c). If a worker has earnings in the year  preceding the year of eligibility or death, or in a later year, we may  not have been able to establish the average of the total wages of all  workers for that year. Therefore, we will divide a worker's actual  earnings in these years by the average of the total wages for the latest  year for which that information is available. Average wage information  is considered available on January 1 of the year following the year in  which it is published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The percentages for all years of actual covered earnings are  then averaged to give the worker's REP for the entire period of work in  the U.S. In determining the percentages for all years of covered  earnings and the REP, we make adjustments as necessary to take account  of the fact that the covered earnings for some years may have involved  less than four U.S. QC's. The actual earnings that are taken into  account in determining the percentage for any year with 1, 2, or 3 QC's  cannot exceed \1/4\, \1/2\, or \3/4\, respectively, of the maximum  creditable earnings for that year. When we determine the REP from the  percentages for all years, we add the percentages for all years, divide  this sum by the total number of QC's credited to the worker, and  multiply this quotient by 4 (see Example 1 of paragraph (d) of this  section). This has the effect of calculating the REP on a quarterly  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each of the worker's computation base years (see  Secs. 404.211(b), 404.221(b) and 404.241(c)), we multiply the average of  the total wages of all workers for that year by the worker's REP. The  product is the amount of earnings attributed to the worker for that  year, subject to the annual wage limitation (see Sec. 404.1047). The  worker's theoretical earnings record consists of his or her attributed  earnings based on his or her REP for all computation base years.  However, we do not attribute earnings to computation base years before  the year of attainment of age 22 or to computation base years beginning  with the year of attainment of retirement age (or the year in which a  period of disability begins), unless the worker is actually credited  with U.S. earnings in those years. In death cases, earnings for the year  of death will be attributed only through the quarter of death, on a  proportional basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determining the theoretical PIA. We determine the worker's  theoretical PIA based on his or her theoretical earnings record by  applying the same computation method that would have applied under  subpart C if the worker had these theoretical earnings and had qualified  for benefits without application of an agreement. However, when the  criteria in Sec. 404.210(a) for the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings  (AIME) computation method are met, only that method is used. If these  criteria are not met but the criteria in Sec. 404.220(a) for the Average  Monthly Wage method are met, then only that method is used. If neither  of these criteria are met, then the old-start method described in  Sec. 404.241 is used. If a theoretical PIA is to be determined based on  a worker's AIME, theoretical earnings amounts for each year, determined  under paragraph (b) of this section, are   indexed in determining the AIME under Sec. 404.211.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determining the pro rata PIA. We then determine a pro rata PIA  from the theoretical PIA. The pro rata PIA is the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The theoretical PIA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ratio of the worker's actual number of U.S. QC's to the  number of calendar quarters in the worker's coverage lifetime. A  coverage lifetime means the worker's benefit computation years as  determined under Sec. 404.211(e), Sec. 404.221(c), or Sec. 404.241(d).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: C attains age 62 in 1982 and needs 31 QC's to be insured.  C worked under the U.S. system from July 1, 1974 to December 31, 1980  and therefore has only 6\1/2\ years during which he worked under the  U.S. system (26 QC's). C, however, has worked under the Social Security  system of a foreign country that is party to a totalization agreement,  and his total U.S. and foreign work, combined as described in  Sec. 404.1908, equals more than 31 QC's. Thus, the combined coverage  gives C insured status. The benefit is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1: Establish C's theoretical earnings record:</p><p class="depth0">The following table shows: (1) C's actual U.S. covered earnings for  each year, (2) the average of the total wages of all workers for that  year and (3) the ratio of (1) to (2):  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">C's actual</p><p class="depth0">U.S.      National   Percentage</p><p class="depth0">Year                                   QC's     covered     average    ratio of</p><p class="depth0">earnings      wage     (1) to (2) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>         (2)         (3) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1974...............................................................        2   $2,045.08   $8,030.76    25.46558 1975...............................................................        4    7,542.00    8,630.92    87.38350 1976...............................................................        4    9,016.00    9,226.48    97.71874 1977...............................................................        4    9,952.00    9,779.44   101.76452 1978...............................................................        4   10,924.00   10,556.03   103.48587 1979...............................................................        4   12,851.00   11,479.46   111.94777 1980...............................................................        4   11,924.00   12,513.46    95.28939 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">C's REP is the average of the ratios in column 3, adjusted to take  account of the fact that C had only 2 QC's in 1974. Thus, the REP equals  the sum of the figures in column 3 (623.05537), divided by the total  number of C's QC's (26) and multiplied by 4, or 95.85467 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Since C attained age 62 in 1982, his computation base years are 1951  through 1981. To establish his theoretical earnings record we use  95.85467 percent of the national average wage for each of the years 1951  through 1981. Since national average wage data is not available for  1981, for that year we attribute 95.85467 percent of the national  average wage for 1980 or $11,994.74. His theoretical earnings record  would look like this:  1951.......................................................    $2,683.13 1952.......................................................     2,850.07 1953.......................................................     3,009.30 1954.......................................................     3,024.83 1955.......................................................     3,164.58 1956.......................................................     3,385.93 1957.......................................................     3,490.76 1958.......................................................     3,521.51 1959.......................................................     3,695.96 1960.......................................................     3,841.01 1961.......................................................     3,917.35 1962.......................................................     4,113.51 1963.......................................................     4,214.38 1964.......................................................     4,386.62 1965.......................................................     4,465.60 1966.......................................................     4,733.65 1967.......................................................     4,997.33 1968.......................................................     5,340.79 1969.......................................................     5,649.44 1970.......................................................     5,929.80 1971.......................................................     6,227.75 1972.......................................................     6,838.08 1973.......................................................     7,265.94 1974.......................................................     7,697.86 1975.......................................................     8,273.14 1976.......................................................     8,844.01 1977.......................................................     9,374.05 1978.......................................................    10,118.45 1979.......................................................    11,003.60 1980.......................................................    11,994.74 1981.......................................................    11,994.74</p><p class="depth0">Step 2: Compute the theoretical PIA: Since C attains age 62 in 1982,  we determine his theoretical PIA using an AIME computation. In applying  the AIME computation, we index each year's earnings on the theoretical  earnings record in accordance with Sec. 404.211(d). In this example, the  theoretical PIA is $453.</p><p class="depth0">Step 3: Compute the pro rata PIA:</p><p class="depth0">Theoretical PIA</p><p class="depth0">- Actual U.S. QC's</p><p class="depth0">----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">calendar quarters in</p><p class="depth0">benefit computation years</p><p class="depth0">$453 - 26 QC's (6\1/2\ years)</p><p class="depth0">----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">104 quarters (26 years)</p><p class="depth0">= $113.20 pro rata PIA</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: M needs 27 QC's to be insured, but she has only 3 years  of work (12 QC's) under the U.S. system. M has enough foreign work,  however, to be insured. She attained age 62 in 1978, and her U.S.  covered earnings were in 1947, 1948 and 1949. Based on M's date of  birth, her theoretical PIA can be computed, in accordance with  Sec. 404.220, under a new start method. If M's earnings in 1947, 1948,  and 1949 were 50 percent, 60 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of  the average wage for each year, her REP would be 60 percent. For each  year in the computation period, 60 percent of the average wage for that  year will be attributed as M's assumed earnings. The theoretical PIA  will then be computed as described in Secs. 404.220 through 404.222.</p><p class="depth0">To determine M's pro rata PIA, the theoretical PIA will be  multiplied by the ratio of   the actual number of U.S. QC's to the number of calendar quarters in the  benefit computation years. There are 22 benefit computation years, or 88  quarters. The pro rata PIA would, therefore, be \12/88\ x theoretical  PIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rounding of benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the effective date of the pro rata  PIA is before June 1982, we will round to the next higher multiple of 10  cents if it is not already a multiple of 10 cents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the effective date of the pro rata PIA is June 1982 or later,  we will round to the next lower multiple of 10 cents if it is not  already a multiple of 10 cents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Auxiliary and survivors benefits; reductions; family maximum. We  will determine auxiliary and survivors benefit amounts (see subpart D)  on the basis of the pro rata PIA. We will apply the regular reductions  for age under section 202(q) of the Act to the benefits of the worker or  to any auxiliaries or survivors which are based on the pro rata PIA (see  Sec. 404.410). Benefits will be payable subject to the family maximum  (see Sec. 404.403) derived from the pro rata PIA. If the pro rata PIA is  less than the minimum PIA, the family maximum will be 1\1/2\ times the  pro rata PIA.  [49 FR 29775, July 24, 1984]</p>
