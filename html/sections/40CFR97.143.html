2007 or 2008 is less than 0.25 lb/mmBtu and, where such unit is included in a NOX averaging plan under Sec. 76.11 of this chapter under the Acid Rain Program for such year, the unit's NOX averaging plan has an actual weighted average NOX emission rate for such year equal to or less than the actual weighted average NOX emission rate for the year before such year and if the unit achieves NOX emission reductions in 2007 and 2008, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR NOX allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owners and operators of such CAIR NOX unit shall monitor and report the NOX emissions rate and the heat input of the unit in accordance with subpart HH of this part in each control period for which early reduction credit is requested.</p><p

allocation of an amount of CAIR NOX allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the sum of the unit's heat input for the control period in 2007 multiplied by the difference (if any greater than zero) between 0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's NOX emission rate for the control period in 2007 plus the unit's heat input for the control period in 2008 multiplied by the difference (if any

and rounded to the nearest whole number of tons as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For any CAIR NOX unit in a State whose compliance with the CAIR NOX emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NOX allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NOX unit shall submit to the Administrator by May 1, 2009 a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NOX allowances from the compliance supplement

paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NOX unit shall demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount of CAIR NOX allowances requested, the unit's compliance with the CAIR NOX emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain a sufficient amount of electricity from other electricity generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at the unit for compliance with the CAIR NOX emissions limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NOX allowances to prevent such undue risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator will review each request under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009 and will allocate CAIR NOX allowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR NOX units in a State and covered by such request as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon receipt of each such request, the Administrator will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of the CAIR NOX allowances requested meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has an amount of CAIR NOX allowances not less than the total amount of CAIR NOX allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOX unit covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NOX allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NOX allowances than the total amount of CAIR NOX allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the Administrator will allocate CAIR NOX allowances to each CAIR NOX unit covered by such requests according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate:
Unit's allocation = Unit's adjusted allocation x (State's compliance supplement pool / Total adjusted allocations for all units)

Objections shall be limited to addressing whether the determination is in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate. Based on any such objections, the Administrator will adjust each determination to the extent necessary to ensure that it is in accordance with such paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will record the allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
