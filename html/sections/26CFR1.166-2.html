                                Sec. 1.166-2  Evidence of worthlessness.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In determining whether a debt is worthless in  whole or in part the district director will consider all pertinent  evidence, including the value of the collateral, if any, securing the  debt and the financial condition of the debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Legal action not required. Where the surrounding circumstances  indicate that a debt is worthless and uncollectible and that legal  action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the  satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will  be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for purposes of  the deduction under section 166.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Bankruptcy--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Bankruptcy is generally an  indication of the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and  unpreferred debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Year of deduction. In bankruptcy cases a debt may become  worthless before settlement in some instances; and in others, only when  a settlement in bankruptcy has been reached. In either case, the mere  fact that bankruptcy proceedings instituted against the debtor are  terminated in a later year, thereby confirming the conclusion that the  debt is worthless, shall not authorize the shifting of the deduction  under section 166 to such later year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Banks and other regulated corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Worthlessness  presumed in year of charge-off. If a bank or other corporation which is  subject to supervision by Federal authorities, or by State authorities  maintaining substantially equivalent standards, charges off a debt in  whole or in part, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In obedience to the specific orders of such authorities, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with established policies of such authorities,  and, upon their first audit of the bank or other corporation subsequent  to the charge-off, such authorities confirm in writing that the charge- off would have been subject to such specific orders if the audit had  been made on the date of the charge-off,  then the debt shall, to the extent charged off during the taxable year,  be conclusively presumed to have become worthless, or worthless only in  part, as the case may be, during such taxable year. But no such debt  shall be so conclusively presumed to be worthless, or worthless only in  part, as the case may be, if the amount so charged off is not claimed as  a deduction by the taxpayer at the time of filing the return for the  taxable year in which the charge-off takes place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of worthlessness in later taxable year. If such a bank  or other corporation does not claim a deduction for such a totally or  partially worthless debt in its return for the taxable year in which the  charge-off takes place, but claims the deduction for a later taxable  year, then the charge-off in the prior taxable year shall be deemed to  have been involuntary and the deduction under section 166 shall be  allowed for the taxable year for which claimed, provided that the  taxpayer produces sufficient evidence to show that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debt became wholly worthless in the later taxable year, or  became recoverable only in part subsequent to the taxable year of the  involuntary charge-off, as the case may be; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that the deduction claimed in the later taxable  year for a debt partially worthless was not involuntarily charged off in  prior taxable years, it was charged off in the later taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conformity election--(i) Eligibility for election. In lieu of  applying paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, a bank (as defined  in paragraph (d)(4)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section) that is subject to supervision  by Federal authorities, or by state authorities maintaining  substantially equivalent standards, may elect under this paragraph  (d)(3) to use a method of accounting that establishes a conclusive  presumption of worthlessness for debts, provided that the bank meets the  express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this  section for the taxable year of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusive presumption--(A) In general. If a bank satisfies the  express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this  section and elects to use the method of accounting under this paragraph  (d)(3)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Debts charged off, in whole or in part, for regulatory purposes  during a taxable year are conclusively presumed to have become  worthless, or worthless only in part, as the case may be, during that  year, but only if the charge-off results from a specific order of the  bank's supervisory authority or corresponds to the bank's classification  of the debt, in whole or in part, as a loss asset, as described in  paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A bad debt deduction for a debt that is subject to regulatory  loss classification standards is allowed for a taxable year only to the  extent that the debt is conclusively presumed to have become worthless  under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A)(1) of this section during that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Charge-off should have been made in earlier year. The conclusive  presumption that a debt is worthless in the year that it is charged off  for regulatory purposes applies even if the bank's supervisory authority  determines in a subsequent year that the charge-off should have been  made in an earlier year. A pattern of charge-offs in the wrong year,  however, may result in revocation of the bank's election by the  Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Loss asset defined. A debt is classified as a loss asset by a  bank if the bank assigns the debt to a class that corresponds to a loss  asset classification under the standards set forth in the ``Uniform  Agreement on the Classification of Assets and Securities Held by Banks''  (See Attachment to Comptroller of the Currency Banking Circular No. 127,  Rev. 4-26-91, Comptroller of the Currency, Communications Department,  Washington, DC 20219) or similar guidance issued by the Office of   the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, or the Farm  Credit Administration; or for institutions under the supervision of the  Office of Thrift Supervision, 12 CFR 563.160(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An election under this paragraph  (d)(3) is to be made on bank-by-bank basis and constitutes either the  adoption of or a change in method of accounting, depending on the  particular bank's facts. A change in method of accounting that results  from the making of an election under this paragraph (d)(3) has the  effects described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of change in method of accounting. A change in method of  accounting resulting from an election under this paragraph (d)(3) does  not require or permit an adjustment under section 481(a). Under this  cut-off approach--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is no change in the Sec. 1.1011-1 adjusted basis of the  bank's existing debts (as determined under the bank's former method of  accounting for bad debts) as a result of the change in method of  accounting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to debts that are subject to regulatory loss  classification standards and are held by the bank at the beginning of  the year of change (to the extent that they have not been charged off  for regulatory purposes), and with respect to debts subject to  regulatory loss classification standards that are originated or acquired  subsequent to the beginning of the year of change, bad debt deductions  in the year of change and thereafter are determined under the method of  accounting for bad debts prescribed by this paragraph (d)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With respect to debts that are not subject to regulatory loss  classification standards or that have been totally charged off prior to  the year of change, bad debt deductions are determined under the general  rules of section 166; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If there was any partial charge-off of a debt in a prechange  year, any portion of which was not claimed as a deduction, the deduction  reflecting that partial charge-off must be taken in the first year in  which there is any further charge-off of the debt for regulatory  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(2)</em> or (3) of this  section. The statement or Form 3115 must include the name, address, and  taxpayer identification number of the electing bank and contain a  declaration that the express determination requirement of paragraph  (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the  election. When a Form 3115 is used, the declaration must be made in the  space provided on the form for ``Other changes in method of  accounting.'' The words ``ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.166-2(d)(3)'' must be  typed or legibly printed at the top of the statement or page 1 of the  Form 3115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> First election. The first time a bank makes this election, the  statement or Form 3115 must be attached to the bank's timely filed  return (taking into account extensions of time to file) for the first  taxable year covered by the election. The consent of the Commissioner to  make a change in method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(3) is  granted, pursuant to section 446(e), to any bank that makes the election  in accordance with this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C), provided the bank has  not made a prior election under this paragraph (d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)</em> of  this section. This consent must be requested under the procedures,  terms, and conditions   prescribed under the authority of section 446(e) and Sec. 1.446-1(e)  for requesting a change in method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>,  the supervisory authority of a bank is the appropriate Federal banking  agency for the bank, as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(q), or,  in the case of an institution in the Farm Credit System, the Farm Credit  Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Transition period election. For taxable years ending before  completion of the first examination of the bank by its supervisory  authority (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section) that  is after October 1, 1992, and that involves the bank's loan review  process, the statement or Form 3115 filed by the bank must include a  declaration that the bank maintains and applies loan loss classification  standards that are consistent with the regulatory standards of that  supervisory authority. A bank that makes this declaration is deemed to  satisfy the express determination requirement of paragraph  (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section for those years, even though an express  determination has not yet been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Revocation of Election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Revocation of an  election under this paragraph (d)(3) constitutes a change in method of  accounting that has the effects described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of  this section. If an election under this paragraph (d)(3) has been  revoked, a bank may make a subsequent election only under the provisions  of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of change in method of accounting. A change in method of  accounting resulting from revocation of an election under this paragraph  (d)(3) does not require or permit an adjustment under section 481(a).  Under this cut-off approach--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is no change in the Sec. 1.1011-1 adjusted basis of the  bank's existing debts (as determined under this paragraph (d)(3) method  or any other former method of accounting used by the bank with respect  to its bad debts) as a result of the change in method of accounting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bad debt deductions in the year of change and thereafter with  respect to all debts held by the bank, whether in existence at the  beginning of the year of change or subsequently originated or acquired,  are determined under the new method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Automatic revocation--(1) In general--A bank's election under  this paragraph (d)(3) is revoked automatically if, in connection with  any examination involving the bank's loan review process by the bank's  supervisory authority as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this  section, the bank does not obtain the express determination required by  that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Year of revocation. If a bank makes the conformity election  under the transition rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(E) of this section  and does not obtain the express determination in connection with the  first examination involving the bank's loan review process that is after  October 1, 1992, the election is revoked as of the beginning of the  taxable year of the election or, if later, the earliest taxable year for  which tax may be assessed. In other cases in which a bank does not  obtain an express determination in connection with an examination of its  loan review process, the election is revoked as of the beginning of the  taxable year that includes the date as of which the supervisory  authority conducts the examination even if the examination is completed  in the following taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)(C)(2)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirements. A bank changing its method of accounting under the  automatic revocation rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) must attach a  completed Form 3115 to its income tax return for the year of revocation  prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C)(2) of this section. The words  ``REVOCATION OF Sec. 1.166-2(d)(3) ELECTION'' must be typed or legibly  printed at the top of page 1 of the Form 3115. If the year of revocation  is a year for which the bank has already filed its income tax return,  the bank must file an amended return for that year reflecting its change  in method of accounting and must attach the completed Form 3115 to that  amended return. The bank also must file amended returns reflecting the  new method of accounting for all subsequent taxable years for which  returns have been filed and tax may be assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> be implemented  retroactively pursuant to the same amended return terms and conditions  as are prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (d)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bank. The term bank has the meaning assigned to it by section  581. The term bank also includes any corporation that would be a bank  within the meaning of section 581 except for the fact that it is a  foreign corporation, but this paragraph (d) applies only with respect to  loans the interest on which is effectively connected with the conduct of  a banking business within the United States. In addition, the term bank  includes a Farm Credit System institution that is subject to supervision  by the Farm Credit Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Charge-off. For banks regulated by the Office of Thrift  Supervision, the term charge-off includes the establishment of specific  allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100 percent of the portion  of the debt classified as loss.
