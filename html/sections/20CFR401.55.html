                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. You have a right to access your medical records,  including any psychological information that we maintain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical records procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification of or access to  medical records. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may request notification of or access to a  medical record pertaining to you. Unless you are a parent or guardian  requesting notification of or access to a minor's medical record, you  must make a request for a medical record in accordance with this section  and the procedures in Secs. 401.45 through 401.50 of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When you request medical information about yourself, you must  also name a representative in writing. The representative may be a  physician, other health professional, or other responsible individual  who will be willing to review the record and inform you of its contents.  Following the discussion, you are entitled to your records. The  representative does not have the discretion to withhold any part of your  record. If you do not designate a representative, we may decline to  release the requested information. In some cases, it may be possible to  release medical information directly to you rather than to your  representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Utilization of the designated representative. You will be  granted direct access to your medical record if we can determine that  direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on you. If we  believe that we are not qualified to determine, or if we do determine,  that direct access to you is likely to have an adverse effect, the  record will be sent to the designated representative. We will inform you  in writing that the record has been sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medical records of minors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request by the minor. You may  request access to your own medical records in accordance with paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests on a minor's behalf; notification of or access to  medical records to an individual on a minor's behalf. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To protect the  privacy of a minor, we will not give to a parent or guardian direct  notification of or access to a minor's record, even though the parent or  guardian who requests such notification or access is authorized to act  on a minor's behalf as provided in Sec. 401.75 of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A parent or guardian must make all requests for notification of  or access to a minor's medical record in accordance with this paragraph  and the procedures in Secs. 401.45 through 401.50 of this part. A parent  or guardian must at the time he or she makes a request designate a  family physician or other health professional (other than a family  member) to whom the record, if any, will be sent. If the parent or  guardian will not designate a representative, we will decline to release  the requested information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where a medical record on the minor exists, we will in all  cases send it to the physician or health professional designated by the  parent or guardian. The representative will review the record, discuss  its contents with the parent or legal guardian, then release the entire  record to the parent or legal guardian. The representative does not have  the discretion to withhold any part of the minor's record. We will  respond in the following similar manner to the parent or guardian making  the request: ``We have completed processing your request for  notification of or access to ----------'s (Name of minor) medical  records. Please be informed that if any medical record was found  pertaining to that individual, it has been sent to your designated  physician or health professional.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In each case where we send a minor's medical record to a  physician or health professional, we will make reasonable efforts to  inform the minor that we have given the record to the representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests on behalf of an incapacitated adult. If you are the  legal guardian of an adult who has been declared legally incompetent,  you may receive his or her records directly.
