                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of State's base allotment for Federal fiscal year  1993. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Federal fiscal year 1993, CMS will calculate for each  State a DSH allotment, using the State's ``base allotment.'' The State's  base allotment is the greater of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total amount of the State's projected DSH payments for  Federal fiscal year 1992 under the State plan applicable to Federal  fiscal year 1992, calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In calculating the State's DSH payments applicable to Federal  fiscal year 1992, CMS will derive amounts from payments applicable to  the period of October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1992, under State  plans or plan   amendments that meet the requirements specified in Sec.  447.296(b). The  calculation will not include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> DSH payment adjustments made by the State applicable to the  period October 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 under State plans or  plan amendments that do not meet the criteria described in Sec.   447.296; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Retroactive DSH payments made in 1992 that are not applicable  to Federal fiscal year 1992.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS will calculate a percentage for each State by dividing the  DSH base allotment by the total unadjusted medical assistance  expenditures, excluding administrative costs, made during Federal fiscal  year 1992. On the basis of this percentage, CMS will classify each State  as a ``high-DSH'' or ``low-DSH'' State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the State's base allotment exceeded 12 percent of its total  unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State plan in  Federal fiscal year 1992, CMS will classify the State as a ``high-DSH''  State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the State's base allotment was 12 percent or less of its  total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State  plan in Federal fiscal year 1992, CMS will classify the State as a  ``low-DSH'' State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State disproportionate share hospital allotments for Federal  fiscal year 1993. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Federal fiscal year 1993, CMS will calculate a  DSH allotment for each low-DSH State that equals the State's base  allotment described under paragraph (a) of this section, increased by  State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments in  Federal fiscal year 1993 may not exceed the dollar amount of DSH  payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State base  allotment).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State disproportionate share hospital allotment for Federal  fiscal years 1994 and after.

This payment limitation will apply until the Federal  fiscal year in which the State's DSH payments applicable to that Federal  fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of the State's total unadjusted  medical assistance expenditures in that Federal fiscal year, equal 12  percent or less. When a high-DSH State's percentage equals 12 percent or  less, the State will be reclassified as a low-DSH State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State growth. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State growth for a State in a Federal  fiscal year is equal to the product of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The growth factor that is CMS's projected percentage increase in  the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures (including  administrative costs) relative to the corresponding amount in the  previous year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State's prior year DSH allotment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the growth factor is zero or is negative, the State growth is  zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a low-DSH State experiences a level of negative growth to the  extent that its previous Federal fiscal year's DSH allotment would be  more than 12 percent of its current Federal fiscal year's total  unadjusted medical assistance expenditures (excluding administrative  costs), the low-DSH State's previous year's DSH allotment will be  reduced to the extent necessary to maintain the individual low-DSH  State's 12-percent limit and that amount will become the low-DSH State's  DSH allotment for the current Federal fiscal year. In no Federal fiscal  year will a low-DSH State's DSH allotment be allowed to exceed its  individual State 12-percent limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Supplemental amount available for low-DSH States. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  supplemental amount is the State's share of a pool of money (referred to  as a redistribution pool).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS will calculate the redistribution pool for the appropriate  Federal   fiscal year by subtracting from the projected national DSH expenditure  target the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total of the State DSH base allotments for all high-DSH  States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total of the previous year's State DSH allotments for all  low-DSH States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State growth amount for all low-DSH States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of additional DSH payment adjustments made in  order to meet the minimum payment adjustments required under section  1923(c)(l) of the Act, which are made in accordance with Sec.   447.296(b)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS will determine the percent of the redistribution pool for  each low-DSH State on the basis of each State's relative share of the  total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for the Federal fiscal  year compared to the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures  for the Federal fiscal year projected to be made by all low-DSH States.  The percent of the redistribution pool that each State will receive is  equal to the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures  divided by the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for all  low-DSH States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS will not provide any low-DSH State a supplemental amount  that would result in the State's total DSH allotment exceeding 12  percent of its projected total unadjusted medical assistance  expenditures. CMS will reallocate any supplemental amounts not allocated  to States because of this 12-percent limitation to other low-DSH States  in accordance with the percentage determined in paragraph (e)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> CMS will not reallocate to low-DSH States the difference between  any State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal fiscal year  and its State DSH allotment applicable to that Federal fiscal year.  Thus, any unspent DSH allotment may not be reallocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special provision. Any increases in a State's aggregate  disproportionate payments, that are made to meet the minimum payment  requirements specified in Sec.  447.296(b)(5), may exceed the State base  allotment to the extent such increases are made to satisfy the minimum  payment requirement. In such cases, CMS will adjust the State's base  allotment in the subsequent Federal fiscal year to include the increased  minimum payments.
