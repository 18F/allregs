                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. The U.S. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  Business Travel Card Program is a voluntary program designed to  facilitate travel for bona fide U.S. business persons engaged in  business in the APEC region and U.S. government officials actively  engaged in APEC business within the APEC region. Participants will  receive a U.S. APEC Business Travel Card that will enable them access to  fast-track immigration lanes at participating airports in foreign APEC  member economies. In order to obtain a U.S. APEC Business Travel Card,  an individual must meet the eligibility requirements specified in this  section, apply in advance, pay any requisite fee and be approved as a  card holder. The APEC member economies are identified at http:// www.apec.org.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program eligibility criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible individuals. An  individual is eligible for the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card if he or  she is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A U.S. citizen;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An existing member in good standing of a CBP trusted traveler  program or approved for membership in a CBP trusted traveler program  during the application process described in paragraph (c) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A bona fide U.S. business person engaged in business in the  APEC region or U.S. Government official actively engaged in APEC  business.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ``APEC business'' means U.S. government activities that support  the work of APEC.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A ``bona fide business person engaged in business in the APEC  region'' means a person engaged in the trade of goods, the provision of  services, or the conduct of investment activities in the APEC region.  Professional athletes, news correspondents, entertainers, musicians,  artists or persons engaged in similar occupations are not considered to  be bona fide business persons engaged in business in the APEC region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conditions regarding the use of the U.S. APEC Business Travel  Card. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card is not transferable and may  be used only by the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card   holder and not by anyone else including the card holder's spouse or  child.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card can be used only if the card  holder is traveling solely for business purposes to a foreign APEC  member economy and is not engaging in paid employment in the foreign  APEC member economy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application process. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each applicant must complete and submit  an application electronically through the Global Entry Enrollment System  (GOES) or other applicable process as determined by CBP. The application  and application instructions for the card are available as an add-on to  the CBP trusted traveler application at www.globalentry.gov.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each applicant must certify that he or she is an existing member  in good standing in a CBP trusted traveler program or that he or she has  submitted an application to a CBP trusted traveler program; that he or  she is a bona fide U.S. business person engaged in business in the APEC  region or U.S. Government official actively engaged in APEC business;  and, that he or she is not a professional athlete, news correspondent,  entertainer, musician, artist or person engaged in a similar occupation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each applicant must provide his or her signature so that the  signature will appear on the face of the card.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the applicant is not a member of a CBP trusted traveler  program, the applicant must concurrently apply for membership in a CBP  trusted traveler program and be approved for such membership. Applicants  for a CBP trusted traveler program must have an in-person interview,  undergo a vetting process and pay the relevant CBP trusted traveler fee.  Active membership in a CBP trusted traveler program is necessary for the  entire duration of the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card. If membership in  the CBP trusted traveler program is set to lapse before the U.S. APEC  Business Travel Card expires, the individual must renew his or her CBP  trusted traveler membership prior to its expiration date in order to  retain membership in the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each applicant must pay a non-refundable fee in the amount set  forth at 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1)(ii)(N) for ``U.S. Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) Business Travel Card'' at the time of application.  The fee is to be paid to CBP at the time of application through the  Federal Government's on-line payment system, Pay.gov or other CBP- approved process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card is valid for a period of 3  years or until the expiration date of the card holder's passport if that  is earlier, provided that membership is not suspended or terminated by  CBP prior to the end of this period. CBP can terminate use of the U.S.  APEC Business Travel Card if the card holder is no longer a member of a  CBP trusted traveler program or if the individual is not compliant with  the program requirements. Each applicant may apply to renew the card  prior to its expiration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited entry privileges. The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card  will enable card holders access to a dedicated fast-track lane for  expedited immigration processing at participating airports in foreign  APEC member economies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Entry requirements. U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holders must  present any travel or identity documentation, such as a passport and  visa, required by the foreign APEC member economies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Denial, removal and suspension. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an applicant is denied a  U.S. APEC Business Travel Card, CBP will notify the applicant of the  denial, and the reasons for the denial. CBP will also provide  instructions regarding how to proceed if the applicant wishes to seek  additional information as to the reason for the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder may be suspended or  removed from the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card Program if CBP  determines at its sole discretion that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder provided false  information in the application and/or during the application process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder failed to follow the  terms, conditions and requirements of the program (including continued  active membership in a CBP trusted traveler program);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder has been arrested or  convicted of a crime or otherwise no longer meets the program  eligibility criteria; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Such action is otherwise necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CBP will notify the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder of his  or her suspension or removal in writing. Such suspension or removal is  effective immediately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A U.S. APEC Business Travel Card applicant or a U.S. APEC  Business Travel Card holder who is denied, suspended, or removed will  not receive a refund, in whole or in part, of the application fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Redress. An individual whose application is denied or whose  participation is suspended or terminated has two possible methods of  redress. These processes do not create or confer any legal right,  privilege, or benefit on the applicant or participant, and are wholly  discretionary on the part of CBP. The methods of redress are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enrollment center. If the applicant or participant applied  concurrently for the U.S. APEC Business Travel Card and a CBP trusted  traveler program, the applicant or participant may contest his or her  denial, suspension or removal by writing to the enrollment center where  that individual's CBP trusted traveler program interview was conducted.  If the applicant or participant was already a member of a CBP trusted  traveler program, the applicant or participant may contest his or her  denial, suspension or removal by writing to the enrollment center where  that individual's signature was collected for the U.S. APEC Business  Travel Card. The enrollment center addresses are available at  www.globalentry.gov, http://www.globalentry.gov/nexus.html and http:// www.globalentry.gov/sentri.html. The letter must be received by CBP  within 30 calendar days of the date provided as the date of suspension  or removal. The individual should write on the envelope ``Redress  Request RE: U.S. APEC Business Travel Card.'' The letter should address  any facts or conduct listed in the notification from CBP as contributing  to the denial, suspension or removal and why the applicant or  participant believes the reason for the action is invalid. If the  applicant or participant believes that the denial, suspension or removal  was based upon inaccurate information, the individual should also  include any reasonably available supporting documentation with the  letter. After review, CBP will inform the individual of its redress  decision. If the individual's request for redress is successful, the  individual's eligibility to be a U.S. APEC Business Travel Card holder  will continue immediately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ombudsman. Applicants and participants may contest a denial,  suspension or removal by writing to the CBP Trusted Traveler Ombudsman  at the address listed on the Web site www.globalentry.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duration of U.S. APEC Business Travel Card Program. DHS will  issue U.S. APEC Business Travel Cards through September 30, 2018. Unless  suspended or revoked, U.S. APEC Business Travel Cards issued on or  before September 30, 2018 are valid until their expiration date, even if  the expiration date is after September 30, 2018.
