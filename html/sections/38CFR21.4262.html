                                Sec. 21.4262  Other training on-the-job courses.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An ``other training on-the-job'' course is any training on the job which does not qualify as an apprentice course, as defined in Sec. 21.4261, but which otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. Any training establishment desiring to furnish a course of other training on-the-job will submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application setting forth the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title and description of the specific job objective for which the veteran or eligible person is to be trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The length of the training period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A schedule listing various operations for major kinds of work or tasks to be learned and showing for each job operations or work, tasks to be performed, and the approximate length of time to be spent on each operation or task;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The number of hours of supplemental related instruction required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The entrance wage or salary paid by the training establishment to employees already trained in the kind of work for which the veteran or eligible person is to be trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A certification that the wages to be paid the veteran or eligible person upon entrance into training are not less than wages paid nonveterans in the same training position and are at least 50 percent of the wages paid for the job for which he or she is to be trained, and will be increased in regular periodic increments until, not later than the last full month of the scheduled training period they will be at least 85 percent of the wages paid for the job for which the veteran or eligible person is being trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A certification that there is reasonable certainty that the job for which the veteran or eligible person is to be trained will be available to him or her at the end of the training period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any additional information required by the State approving agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval criteria. The appropriate State approving agency may approve the application submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, when the training establishment and its courses are found upon investigation to have met the criteria outlined in this paragraph. Approval will not be granted for training in occupations which require a relatively short period of experience for a trainee to obtain and hold employment at the market wage in the occupation. This includes occupations such as automobile service station attendant or manager, soda fountain attendant, food service worker, salesman, window washer, building custodian or other unskilled or common labor positions as well as clerical positions for which on-the-job training is not the normal method of procuring qualified personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The job which is the objective of the training is one in which progression and appointment to the next higher classification are based upon skills

learned through organized and supervised training on-the-job and not on such factors as length of service and normal turnover;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The training content of the course is adequate to qualify the veteran or eligible person for appointment to the job for which he or she is to be trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The job customarily requires a period of training of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years of full-time training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The length of the training period is not longer than that customarily required by the training establishments in the community to provide the veteran or eligible person with the required skills, arrange for the acquiring of job knowledge, technical information, and other facts which the veteran or eligible person will need to learn in order to become competent on the job for which he or she is being trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provision is made for related instruction for the individual veteran or eligible person who may need it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There is in the training establishment adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide satisfactory training on-the-job;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Adequate records are kept to show the progress made by each veteran or eligible person toward his or her job objective;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The veteran or eligible person is not already qualified by training and experience for the job;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section are met;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A signed copy of the training agreement for each veteran or eligible person, including the training program and wage schedule as approved by the State approving agency, is provided to the veteran or eligible person and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State approving agency by the employer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The course meets such other reasonable criteria as may be established by the State approving agency.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3677)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Promotion. As funding permits, Department of Veterans Affairs employees will promote the development of on-the-job training courses. They will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visit employers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordinate their efforts with activities of any State approving agencies that may choose to promote the development of on-the-job training courses, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Avoid duplicating the efforts of others by coordinating their promotional efforts with similar activities of the Department of Labor and State employment security agencies as provided by written agreements covering these activities, including utilization of disabled veterans' outreach program specialists.
