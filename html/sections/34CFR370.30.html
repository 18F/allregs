                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary allocates the funds available under this part for any fiscal year to the States on the basis of the relative population of each State. The Secretary allocates at least $50,000 to each State, unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act (which provides for increasing the minimum allotment if the appropriation for the CAP exceeds $7,500,000 or the appropriation is increased by a certain percentage described in section 112(e)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act) are applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary allocates $30,000 each, unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act are applicable, to American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau, except that the Secretary allocates to the Republic of Palau only 75 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1996, only 50 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1997, only 25 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1998, and none of this allotment in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless prohibited or otherwise provided by State law, regulation, or policy, the Secretary pays to the designated agency, from the State allotment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the amount specified in the State's approved request. Because the designated agency is the eventual, if not the direct, recipient of the CAP funds, 34 CFR part 81 applies to the designated agency, whether or not the designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant. However, because it is the State that submits an application for and receives the CAP grant, the State remains the grantee for purposes of 34 CFR parts 76 and 77 and the recipient under 2 CFR 200.86. In addition, both the State and the designated agency are considered recipients for purposes of 34 CFR part 81.
