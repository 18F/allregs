                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Each owner or operator of any affected source (existing or new) shall comply with the general wastewater requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section and the maintenance wastewater provisions in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. An owner or operator may transfer wastewater to a treatment operation not owned by the owner or operator in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify wastewater that requires control. For each POD, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to determine whether a wastewater stream is an affected wastewater stream that requires control for soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds or to designate the wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, respectively. The owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section for different affected wastewater generated at the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine characteristics of a wastewater stream. At new and existing sources, a wastewater stream is an affected wastewater stream if the annual average concentration and annual load exceed any of the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. At new sources, a wastewater stream is subject to additional control requirements if the annual average concentration and annual load exceed the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

For existing sources, the owner or operator may elect to designate wastewater streams as meeting the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A),(B), or (C) of this section. For new sources, the owner or operator may elect to designate wastewater streams meeting the criterion in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) or for wastewater known to contain no soluble HAP, as meeting the criterion in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For designated wastewater the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section shall be followed, except as specified in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (g)(9)(i), and (g)(10) of this section. The owner or operator is not required to determine the annual average concentration or load for each designated wastewater stream for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> From the POD for the wastewater stream that is designated as an affected wastewater stream to the location where the owner or operator elects to designate such wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, the owner or operator shall comply with all applicable emission suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From the location where the owner or operator designates a wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, such wastewater stream shall be managed in accordance with all applicable emission suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and with the treatment requirements in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Scrubber effluent.
