                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator may, upon notice and opportunity for a public  hearing, exempt the owner or operator of a source if he finds with  respect to a particular instance of noncompliance, that such  noncompliance was de minimis in nature and duration, and was caused  solely by a sudden and unavoidable breakdown of process or pollution  control equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A petition for an exemption on the ground that the violation was  de minimis and was caused by a sudden and unavoidable breakdown of  process or pollution control equipment may only raise issues related to  entitlement to an exemption and shall contain or be accompanied by  supporting documentation. Issues relating to entitlement to an exemption  that are not raised in the petition shall be deemed waived. In making  such finding the Administrator shall consider whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The violation was de minimis in nature and duration within the  meaning of Sec. 66.32;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or  processes, including appropriate back-up systems, were designed, and  have been maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good  practice for minimizing emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Repair of the malfunctioning equipment was undertaken and  carried out in an expeditious fashion as soon as the owner or operator  knew or should have known that the malfunction existed or that  applicable emission limitations were being violated or were likely to be  violated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All practicable steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  excess emissions (including any bypass) on ambient air quality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The excess emissions were not part of a pattern indicative of  inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Off-shift and overtime labor were utilized where necessary to  ensure that repairs were made as expeditiously as   possible or that emissions were minimized to the maximum extent  possible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The level of economic savings, if any, accruing to the source  owner or operator was de minimis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any activity that could have been foreseen, avoided or planned  for, or any breakdown that could have been avoided by the exercise of  reasonable diligence shall not constitute grounds for an exemption under  this section. Such activities include, but are not limited to, sudden  breakdowns avoidable by better maintenance procedures, phasing in and  out of process equipment and routine maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A hearing on any petition for an exemption based upon the  unavoidable breakdown of pollution control equipment shall be informal.  The hearing shall be scheduled upon notice to the public. Reasonable  opportunity to testify and for submission of questions by the public to  the petitioner shall be afforded. The decision of the hearing officer  will be made in writing within a reasonable period of time after the  close of the hearing.</p>
