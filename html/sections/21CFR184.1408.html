Licorice extract is that portion of the licorice root that is, after  maceration, extracted by boiling water. The extract can be further  purified by filtration and by treatment with acids and ethyl alcohol.  Licorice extract is sold as a liquid, paste (``block''), or spray-dried  powder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ammoniated glycyrrhizin is prepared from the water extract of  licorice root by acid precipitation followed by neutralization with  dilute ammonia. Monoammonium glycyrrhizinate  (C42H61O16NH45H2O,</p><p class="depth3">CAS Reg. No. 1407-03-0) is prepared from ammoniated glycyrrhizin by  solvent extraction and separation techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredients shall meet the following specifications when  analyzed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assay. The glycyrrhizin content of each flavoring ingredient  shall be determined by the method in the Official Methods of Analysis of  the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 13th Ed., Secs. 19.136- 19.140, which is incorporated by reference, or by methods 19.CO1 through  19.CO4 in the Journal of the Association of Official Analytical  Chemists, 65:471-472 (1982), which are also incorporated by reference.  Copies of all of these methods are available from the AOAC  INTERNATIONAL, 481   North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or available  for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA).
