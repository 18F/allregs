                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ACCELERATED procedure makes available a procedure where the appeal is resolved, whenever possible, within 180 days from the date such procedure is elected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Promptly upon receipt of appellant's election of the ACCELERATED procedure, the assigned Administrative Judge shall take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a telephone conference with both parties:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify and simplify the issues in dispute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the particular appeal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine whether a hearing is desired and, if so, fix a time and place for a hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Establish a schedule for the accelerated resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The subpoena power set forth in Rule 24 is available for use under the ACCELERATED procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The filing of pleadings, motions, discovery proceedings or prehearing procedures will be permitted only to the extent consistent with the requirement of conducting the hearing at the scheduled time and place or, if no hearing is scheduled, the closing of the record at an early time so as to permit decision of the appeal with the 180-day

limit. The Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods for any actions required or permitted under these rules, necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 180-day limit, allowing whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of briefs, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Decisions in appeals considered under the ACCELERATED procedure are rendered by a single Administrative Judge, subject to the concurrence of the Vice-Chair or another assigned Administrative Judge. In the event of an even division on an appeal, the Chair participates in the decision of the appeal. Written decisions of appeals considered under this procedure are short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. In cases where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or less and there has been a hearing under the ACCELERATED procedure the presiding Administrative Judge may, in his or her discretion, hear closing oral arguments of the parties and then render an oral decision on the appeal. Such decision will include summary findings of fact and conclusions. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered the Board subsequently furnishes the parties with a written transcript of the oral decision for record and payment purposes and to commence the time period for the filing of a motion for reconsideration under Rule 33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Decisions of the Board under the ACCELERATED procedure are published and have precedential value. Such decisions may be appealed by either party.</p>
