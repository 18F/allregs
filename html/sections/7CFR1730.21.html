                                Sec. 1730.21  Inspections and tests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each borrower shall conduct all necessary inspections and tests  of the component parts of its electric system, annually exercise its  ERP, and maintain records of such inspections and tests. For the purpose  of this part, ``Exercise'' means a borrower's Tabletop execution of, or  actual implementation of, the ERP to verify the operability of the ERP.  Such Exercise may be performed singly by an individual borrower, or as  an active participant in a multi-party (to include utilities, government  agencies and other participants or combination thereof) Tabletop  execution or actual full implementation of the ERP. For the purpose of  this part, ``Tabletop'' means a hypothetical emergency response scenario  in which participants will identify the policy, communication,  resources, data, coordination, and organizational elements associated  with an emergency response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The frequency of inspection and testing will be determined by  the borrower in conformance with applicable laws, regulations, national  standards, and Prudent Utility Practice. The frequency of inspection and  testing will be determined giving due consideration to the type of  facilities or equipment, manufacturer's recommendations, age, operating  environment and hazards to which the facilities are exposed,  consequences of failure, and results of previous inspections and tests.  The records of such inspections and tests will be retained in accordance  with applicable regulatory requirements and Prudent Utility Practice.  The retention period should be of a sufficient time period to identify  long-term trends. Records must be retained at least until the applicable  inspections or tests are repeated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inspections of facilities must include a determination of  whether the facility complies with the National Electrical Safety Code,  National Electrical Code (as applicable), and applicable State or local  regulations and whether additional security measures are considered  necessary to reduce the vulnerability of those facilities which, if  damaged or destroyed, would severely impact the reliability and security  of the electric power grid, cause significant risk to the safety and  health of the public and/or impact the ability to provide service to  consumers over an extended period of time. The electric power grid, also  known as the transmission grid, consists of a network of electrical  lines and related facilities, including certain substations, used to  connect distribution facilities to generation facilities, and includes  bulk transmission and subtransmission facilities as defined in  Sec. 1710.2 of this title. Any serious or life-threatening deficiencies  shall be promptly repaired, disconnected, or isolated in accordance with  applicable codes or regulations. Any other deficiencies found as a  result of such inspections and tests are to be recorded and those  records are to be maintained until such deficiencies are corrected or  for the retention period required by paragraph (b) of this section,  whichever is longer.  [63 FR 3450, Jan. 23, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 60540, Oct. 12, 2004]</p>
