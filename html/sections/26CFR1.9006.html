                            <p class="depth0">Section 946 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 729) provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest on underpayment. Notwithstanding section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in the case of any taxable year ending before the date of the enactment of this Act, no interest on any underpayment of tax, to the extent such underpayment is attributable to the amendments made by this Act, shall be assessed or collected for any period before the 90th day after such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Declarations of estimated tax. In the case of a taxable year beginning before the date of the enactment of this Act, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by this Act, such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with the first installment date on or after the 30th day after such date of enactment. With respect to any declaration or payment of estimated tax before such first installment date, sections 6015, 6154, 6654, and 6655 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be applied without regard to the amendments made by this Act. For purposes of this subsection, the term ``installment date'' means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of such Code (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is required to be made by the taxpayer.
[T.D. 7088, 36 FR 3052, Feb. 17, 1971]


Sec. 1.9006-1  Interest and penalties in case of certain taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interest on underpayment. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was amended in many important respects by the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Certain of these amendments affect taxable years ending prior to December 30, 1969 (the date of enactment of the Act) and thereby may cause underpayments of tax by a number of taxpayers for those years. Under section 6601(a) of the Code, interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum is imposed upon the amount of any such underpayment. The effect of section 946(a) of the Act is to prevent the assessment or collection of interest on an underpayment of tax for any taxable year ending before December 30, 1969, if such underpayment is attributable to any amendment made by such Act, for the period from the due date for payment until March 30, 1970. Thus, the taxpayer is afforded an interest-free period of 90 days from the date of enactment of such Act within which to account for the changes in the law affecting him and to remit the amount of such underpayment. If, on or after March 30, 1970, the amount of any underpayment (or portion thereof) attributable to an amendment made by the Act remains unpaid, then, as of such date, such underpayment (or portion thereof) shall be subject to interest as provided by section 6601 of the Code, to be computed from such date. However, if a corporation or farmers' cooperative elects to pay its final tax in two installments under section 6152 of the Code and if the second installment is

due after March 30, 1970, then, in order to escape the imposition of interest under section 6601, such corporation or cooperative need pay only one-half of the additional tax arising from an amendment made by the Act before March 30, 1970, with the remaining one-half payable as part of the second installment on the regular due date for that installment. In the case of an underpayment of tax which is only partly attributable to an amendment made by the Act, section 946(a) of such Act shall apply only to the extent that such underpayment is so attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Declarations and payments of estimated tax. (1) In the case of a taxable year beginning before December 30, 1969, section 946(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 provides transitional rules with respect to the payment of estimated tax and, in the case of an individual, the filing of a declaration of estimated tax. Under such section 946(b) in the case of such a year, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by the Act, such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with the first installment date on or after February 15, 1970. For purposes of section 946(b) of such Act and this section, the term ``installment date'' means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of the Code (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is required to be made by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a taxable year beginning before December 30, 1969, section 946(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 provides transitional rules with respect to the payment of estimated tax and, in the case of an individual, the filing of a declaration of estimated tax. Under such section 946(b) in the case of such a year, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by the Act, such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with the first installment date on or after February 15, 1970. For purposes of section 946(b) of such Act and this section, the term ``installment date'' means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of the Code (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is required to be made by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to any declaration or payment of estimated tax before February 15, 1970, sections 6015, 6153, 6154, 6654, and 6655 of the Code shall be applied without regard to the amendments made by such Act. Therefore, any underpayment which occurs solely by reason of the amendments made by such Act shall not be treated as an underpayment in the case of installment dates before February 15, 1970. Similarly, in the case of a taxpayer all of whose installment dates occur prior to February 15, 1970, no payment of estimated tax need be made to reflect the amendments made by such Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following example illustrates the application of the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year from July 1, 1969, through June 30, 1970, had, without regard to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, a total tax liability, which would have been shown on his return, of $500. A is not a farmer or fisherman described in section 6037(b). A's tax liability is increased by $20 to $520, attributable to an amendment made by such Act. A makes an installment payment of estimated tax of $90 on each of the following four installment dates: October 15, 1969; December 15, 1969; March 15, 1970; and July 15, 1970. Assume that A is unaffected by the exceptions provided in section 6654(d). Therefore, A is underpaid by $10 on both October 15 and December 15, and by $18 on both March 15 and July 15. Such underpayments are computed as follows:

Sec. 1.9200-1  Deduction for motor carrier operating authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 266 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-34, 95 Stat. 265) provides that, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, an ordinary deduction shall be allowed in computing the taxable income of all taxpayers

who either held one or more motor carrier operating authorities on July 1, 1980, or later acquired a motor carrier operating authority pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980. The deduction for each motor carrier operating authority is to be allowed ratably over a 60-month period and is equal to the adjusted basis of the motor carrier operating authority on July 1, 1980. Except as provided in this section, no deduction is allowable for any diminution in value of any motor carrier operating authority caused by administrative or legislative actions to decrease restrictions on entry into the interstate motor carrier business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Person entitled to claim deduction. In general, the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority may be claimed only by the taxpayer which held the authority on July 1, 1980. However, if another person acquired the motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980, pursuant to a binding contract in effect on that date, the deduction for such authority may be claimed only by the acquirer and may not be claimed by the taxpayer which held the authority on July 1, 1980. A taxpayer, otherwise entitled to claim a deduction under this section, who sells a motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980 may not claim an amortization deduction for such authority for any month which begins after the date of such sale. In addition, acquisition of a motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980, if not pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980, will not entitle the acquirer to a deduction under this section, unless the operating authority is acquired pursuant to a transaction to which section 381 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allowance of deduction--(1) Determination of period for deduction--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the 60-month period for taking the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority begins with the month of July 1980, or, if later, the month in which the motor carrier operating authority was acquired pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of period for deduction--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the 60-month period for taking the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority begins with the month of July 1980, or, if later, the month in which the motor carrier operating authority was acquired pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the 60-month period for taking the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority begins with the month of July 1980, or, if later, the month in which the motor carrier operating authority was acquired pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election. In lieu of beginning the 60-month period as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may elect to begin the 60-month period with the first month of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980. This election, if made, shall apply to the deduction for all motor carrier operating authorities either held by the taxpayer on July 1, 1980, or later acquired by the taxpayer by the end of the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980, pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980. Any such election will not apply to the determination of the period for amortizing the bases of authorities acquired by the taxpayer after the end of the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of monthly deduction. In the case of each motor carrier operating authority for which the taxpayer is entitled (under paragraph (b) of this section) to claim a deduction, the deduction for each month during the 60-month period relating to the motor carrier operating authority is equal to the adjusted basis (determined under paragraph (e) of this section) of the motor carrier operating authority divided by 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definition of motor carrier-operating authority. For purposes of Sec. 1.9200-2 and this section, the term ``motor carrier operating authority'' means a certificate or permit held by a motor common carrier or motor contract carrier of property and issued pursuant to the Revised Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 10921-10933 (Supp. III 1979). The terms ``motor common carrier'' and ``motor contract carrier'' shall be defined as in 49 U.S.C. 10102 (Supp. III 1979) and do not include persons meeting the definition of freight forwarder contained in 49 U.S.C. 10102 (Supp. III 1979).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Adjusted basis of motor carrier operating authority--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the adjusted basis of a motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction is allowed under this section is the adjusted basis of the motor carrier operating authority as determined under sections 1012 and 1016 in the hands of the taxpayer who is entitled

to claim the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the adjusted basis of a motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction is allowed under this section is the adjusted basis of the motor carrier operating authority as determined under sections 1012 and 1016 in the hands of the taxpayer who is entitled

to claim the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule in case of certain stock acquisitions--(i) Election by holder. A corporation entitled to claim a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section for a motor carrier operating authority may elect to allocate a portion of the cost basis of a qualified acquiring party in the stock of an acquired corporation, to the basis of the authority. A qualified acquiring party is a corporation (or a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) that after June 21, 1952, and on or before July 1, 1980 (or after July 1, 1980 under a binding contract in effect on such date) acquired by purchase, within the meaning of section 334(b)(3) and during a period of not more than 12 months, 80 percent or more of the stock (as described in section 334(b)(2)(B)) of a corporation (the acquired corporation) which held the authority directly or indirectly on the date which is the end of the period of 12 months or less within which such 80 percent of the acquired corporation's stock was purchased. The election to allocate basis in an acquired corporation's stock to the basis in an authority may be made only if 80 percent of all classes of the acquired corporation's stock (other than nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends) was acquired by purchase (within the meaning of section 334(b)(3)) during a period of not more than 12 months, as described in section 334(b)(2)(B). If the qualified acquiring party is a corporation, the taxpayer holding the authority on July 1, 1980, may elect the basis allocation of this paragraph only if it is a member of the affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) of which the qualified acquiring party is a member. If there is more than one acquisition of stock that might permit an election to allocate basis under this paragraph (e)(2)(i), the taxpayer may elect to allocate to the authority only the basis in the acquired corporation's stock held by the qualified acquiring party which became a qualified acquiring party as a result of the last of such acquisitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Election by holder. A corporation entitled to claim a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section for a motor carrier operating authority may elect to allocate a portion of the cost basis of a qualified acquiring party in the stock of an acquired corporation, to the basis of the authority. A qualified acquiring party is a corporation (or a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) that after June 21, 1952, and on or before July 1, 1980 (or after July 1, 1980 under a binding contract in effect on such date) acquired by purchase, within the meaning of section 334(b)(3) and during a period of not more than 12 months, 80 percent or more of the stock (as described in section 334(b)(2)(B)) of a corporation (the acquired corporation) which held the authority directly or indirectly on the date which is the end of the period of 12 months or less within which such 80 percent of the acquired corporation's stock was purchased. The election to allocate basis in an acquired corporation's stock to the basis in an authority may be made only if 80 percent of all classes of the acquired corporation's stock (other than nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends) was acquired by purchase (within the meaning of section 334(b)(3)) during a period of not more than 12 months, as described in section 334(b)(2)(B). If the qualified acquiring party is a corporation, the taxpayer holding the authority on July 1, 1980, may elect the basis allocation of this paragraph only if it is a member of the affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) of which the qualified acquiring party is a member. If there is more than one acquisition of stock that might permit an election to allocate basis under this paragraph (e)(2)(i), the taxpayer may elect to allocate to the authority only the basis in the acquired corporation's stock held by the qualified acquiring party which became a qualified acquiring party as a result of the last of such acquisitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain noncorporate persons treated as qualified parties. For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section, the term ``qualified acquiring party'' shall include a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons which, after June 21, 1952 and on or before July 1, 1980, acquired in one purchase, stock in a corporation (the acquired corporation) which at the time of acquisition held, directly or indirectly, a motor carrier operating authority. In order to be treated as a qualified acquiring party under this paragraph, a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons must have held stock constituting control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) of the acquired corporation on July 1, 1980. A group of noncorporate persons consists of two or more noncorporate persons who, acting together on the same date, made the required purchase of stock in the acquired corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Portion of stock basis allocable to basis of authority when stock of direct holder of authority is acquired. If the qualified acquiring party acquired the stock of a corporation directly holding the authority, the portion of the stock basis allocable to the basis of the authority is the amount that would have been properly allocable under section 334(b)(2) if the qualified acquiring party were a corporation that had received the authority in a distribution of all the acquired corporation's assets in a complete liquidation of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition of the acquired corporation's stock. If the acquired corporation's stock was acquired on more than one date, the date on which the liquidation is deemed to have occurred shall be the date which is the date of the last acquisition by purchase of stock of the acquired corporation within the 12-month period described in section 334(b)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Portion of stock basis allocable to basis of authority when stock of indirect holder of authority is acquired. If the qualified acquiring party acquired the stock of a corporation indirectly holding the authority (such as by owning all of the stock of a subsidiary that directly holds the authority), a portion of the qualified acquiring party's cost basis in the stock of the acquired corporation may be allocated to the basis in the operating authority. The portion allocable is the amount that would

have been properly allocable under section 334(b)(2) if, immediately before the liquidation of the acquired corporation on the date of the last acquisition by purchase of stock of the acquired corporation within the 12-month period described in section 334(b)(2)(B), the authority had been transferred in such a way (such as by liquidating the subsidiary that directly holds the authority) that the qualified acquiring party would have received direct ownership of the authority upon the liquidation of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other assets to be accounted for. For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section, in determining the portion of stock basis properly allocable to the operating authority under section 334(b)(2), the portion of the qualified acquiring party's basis in the acquired corporation's stock that would have been allocable following the liquidation to other assets of the acquired corporation, including intangible assets such as goodwill and going concern value, must be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Adjustments to basis in acquired corporation's stock and other assets. If a taxpayer makes the election provided by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the qualified acquiring party's basis in the stock of the acquired corporation shall be decreased, effective as of July 1, 1980, by the amount determined by the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25SE06.013

In addition, if the aggregate basis of the assets of the acquired corporation other than the authority as of July 1, 1980 (reduced by the liabilities secured by such assets) exceeds the qualified acquiring party's basis in the stock of the acquired corporation remaining after application of the preceding sentence, then the bases of such assets shall be reduced proportionately so that their aggregate basis as of such date (minus secured liabilities) is equal to such remaining stock basis. If the acquired corporation held the authority indirectly, appropriate basis reductions shall be made to reflect the transfers deemed to have occurred under paragraph (e)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Pre-TEFRA law applies. References made in this section to section 334 of the Code relate to such section as it existed before amendment by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Adjustment to basis of motor carrier operating authority. A taxpayer's basis in a motor carrier operating authority must be reduced by the amount of any amortization deductions allowable to the taxpayer under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X acquired all the stock of corporation Y for $130,000 in 1970. Y's assets at the time of acquisition consisted of a motor carrier operating authority valued at $180,000 in which it has a basis of $60,000, trucks with a fair market value of $70,000 and an aggregate basis of $30,000, and goodwill valued at $30,000. Y has $50,000 of liabilities secured by the trucks and $100,000 of unsecured liabilities. Both X and Y use a June 30 fiscal year for tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Y is the only taxpayer eligible to claim a deduction under Sec. 1.9200-1(b). If X sold its Y stock to Z in October 1980 (other than pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980), Y would continue to be the only taxpayer eligible to claim the deduction. However, if Y sold the operating authority to W in February 1981, neither Y nor W would be eligible to claim the monthly deduction for the remainder of the 60-month period. Also, Y would realize gain or loss on the sale after reducing its basis in the authority by any amortization claimed for the period prior to the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Y must begin the 60-month period in July 1980 unless it elects under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to begin the 60-month period with the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980, which in Y's case would be July 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Y's allowable monthly deduction is equal to its adjusted basis in the operating authority of $60,000, divided by 60, or $1,000. However, Y may elect under Sec. 1.9200-1(e)(2) to allocate to its basis in the authority a portion of X's basis in Y stock, since X is a qualified acquiring party under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and Y is a member of an affiliated group of which X is a member. Assuming Y makes the election, Y may allocate to the basis of the authority the amount of X's basis in Y stock that would have been allocable under section 334(b)(2) if X had received the authority in a distribution of all of Y's assets in a complete liquidation of Y immediately after X acquired Y's stock.

Therefore, for purposes of the allocation, X's $130,000 cost basis in Y stock is deemed to be increased by Y's $100,000 of unsecured liabilities to $230,000. Of the $230,000 deemed basis, $180,000 is allocated to the authority, $30,000 to goodwill, and $20,000 to the trucks. Y's allowable monthly amortization deduction would be $180,000 divided by 60, or $3,000. X's $130,000 cost basis in its Y stock must be decreased to $62,174 as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section. Y's $30,000 aggregate basis in its trucks remains unchanged.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that Y's aggregate basis in the trucks is $120,000. If Y makes the election under Sec. 1.9200-1(e)(2), the same allocation as in Example (1) would occur. However, in addition to the decrease in X's basis in its Y stock to $62,174, the $120,000 aggregate basis in the trucks must be reduced to $112,174 (so that the $112,174 basis minus secured liabilities of $50,000 is equal to X's $62,174 remaining stock basis).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that X pays a negotiated purchase price of $120,000 for the Y stock, in order to take into account an anticipated tax liability of $10,000, relating to potential section 1245 recapture. If Y makes the election under Sec. 1.9200-1(e)(2), then for purposes of allocating X's basis in Y stock, X's cost basis is deemed to be increased by Y's $100,000 of unsecured liabilities as well as the $10,000 of potential tax liability resulting from section 1245 recapture, to $230,000. The $10,000 of potential recapture tax is treated as a general liability and the deemed basis is allocated among Y's assets as in Example (1). In order to take into account the potential recapture tax liability, such amount must be based on the same fair market values that are used to determine the amount of the stock basis allocable to the operating authority.

Sec. 1.9200-2  Manner of taking deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The deduction provided by Sec. 1.9200-1 shall be taken by multiplying the amount of the monthly deduction determined under Sec. 1.9200-1 (c)(2) for each motor carrier operating authority by the number of months in the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable, and entering the resulting amount at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's return for each year in which the deduction is properly claimed. Additionally, any taxpayer who has claimed the deduction provided by Sec. 1.9200-1 must (unless it has already filed a statement containing the required information) attach a statement to the next income tax return of the taxpayer which has a filing due date on or after June 4, 1984. The statement shall provide, in addition to the taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, the following information for each motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction was claimed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxable year of the taxpayer for which the deduction was first claimed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the taxpayer's deduction was determined using the adjusted basis of the authority under section 1012 or an allocated stock basis under Sec. 1.9200-1(e)(2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an allocation of stock basis has been made under Sec. 1.9200-1(e)(2), the calculations made in determining the amount of basis to be allocated to the authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing and amendment of returns. A taxpayer who has filed its return for the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, claiming the deduction allowed under Sec. 1.9200-1, may amend its return for such year in order to elect under Sec. 1.9200-1(c)(1)(ii) to begin the 60-month period in the subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer eligible to take the deduction under Sec. 1.9200-1 who has filed its

returns for both the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, and the following taxable year without claiming the deduction, may claim the deduction by filing amended returns or claims for refund for the taxable year in which the taxpayer elects to begin the 60-month period, and for subsequent taxable years. If a taxpayer first claims the deduction on an amended return under the preceding sentence, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be attached to such amended return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deduction taken for operating authority other than under Sec. 1.9200-1. If a deduction other than the deduction allowed under Sec. 1.9200-1 was taken in any taxable year for the reduction in value of a motor carrier operating authority caused by administrative or legislative actions to decrease restrictions on entry into the interstate motor carrier business, the taxpayer should file an amended return for such taxable year which computes taxable income without regard to such deduction.

For a taxable year beginning in the applicable taxable year (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), a taxpayer who is a natural person may reduce taxable income by $500 for each displaced individual (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) to whom the taxpayer provides housing free of charge in, or on the site of, the taxpayer's principal residence for a period of at least 60 consecutive days. A taxpayer may claim the reduction in taxable income for any applicable taxable year in which a consecutive 60-day period ends. A taxpayer may not claim the reduction in taxable income unless the taxpayer includes the taxpayer identification number of the displaced individual on the taxpayer's income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Provision of housing--(1) Principal residence.

No reduction in taxable income is allowed under this section to a taxpayer who receives rent or any reimbursement or compensation (whether in cash, services, or property) from any source for providing housing to the displaced individual. For this purpose, lodging, utilities, and other similar items are treated as housing, but telephone calls, food, clothing, transportation, and other similar items are not treated as housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitations--(1) Dollar limitation--(i) In general.

The limitations of this paragraph (c) apply separately to each disaster area. Thus, a taxpayer may reduce taxable income by $2,000 for providing housing to Midwestern disaster displaced individuals even though the taxpayer reduced taxable income for providing housing to one or more Hurricane Katrina displaced individuals.

H and W file their 2009 income tax returns as married filing separately. Because H and W reduced their 2008 taxable income for providing housing to O, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, neither H nor W may reduce taxable income on their 2009 income tax returns for providing housing to O. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(4) of this section, either H or W but not both, may reduce taxable income by $500 on his or her 2009 income tax return for providing housing to P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that in 2009 H and W provide housing to five Midwestern disaster displaced individuals in addition to O. H and W together may reduce taxable income on their 2009 income tax returns by a total of $2,000 for the Midwestern disaster displaced individuals (other than O). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, H and W may allocate the $2,000 in increments of $500 between their separate returns.
