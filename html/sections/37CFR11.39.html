                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appointment. A hearing officer, appointed by the USPTO Director  under 5 U.S.C. 3105 or 35 U.S.C. 32, shall conduct disciplinary  proceedings as provided by this Part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Independence of the Hearing Officer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A hearing officer  appointed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall not be  subject to first level or second level supervision by either the USPTO  Director or OED Director, or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A hearing officer appointed in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this section shall not be subject to supervision of the person(s)  investigating or prosecuting the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A hearing officer appointed in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this section shall be impartial, shall not be an individual who has  participated in any manner in the decision to initiate the proceedings,  and shall not have been employed under the immediate supervision of the  practitioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A hearing officer appointed in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this section shall be admitted to practice law and have suitable  experience and training conducting hearings, reaching a determination,  and rendering an initial decision in an equitable manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibilities. The hearing officer shall have authority,  consistent with specific provisions of these regulations, to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make rulings upon motions and other requests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rule upon offers of proof, receive relevant evidence, and  examine witnesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Authorize the taking of a deposition of a witness in lieu of  personal appearance of the witness before the hearing officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determine the time and place of any hearing and regulate its  course and conduct;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Hold or provide for the holding of conferences to settle or  simplify the issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Receive and consider oral or written arguments on facts or law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Adopt procedures and modify procedures for the orderly  disposition of proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Make initial decisions under Sec.

The USPTO Director will not  review an interlocutory order of a hearing officer except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the hearing officer shall be of the opinion:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the interlocutory order involves a controlling question of  procedure or law as to which there is a substantial ground for a  difference of opinion, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That an immediate decision by the USPTO Director may materially  advance the ultimate termination of the disciplinary proceeding, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In an extraordinary situation where the USPTO Director deems  that justice requires review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Stays pending review of interlocutory order. If the OED Director  or a respondent seeks review of an interlocutory order of a hearing  officer under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any time period set by  the hearing officer for taking action shall not be stayed unless ordered  by the USPTO Director or the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The hearing officer shall engage in no ex parte discussions with  any party on the merits of the complaint, beginning with appointment and  ending when the final agency decision is issued.</p>
