                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent  permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate  in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.  A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal  financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal  programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a  program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect. The Board shall  review the List of Debarred entities prior to making final loan  Guarantee decisions. Suspension or debarment may be a basis for denying  a loan Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section applies to all persons who have participated, are  currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in  transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of this  section such transactions will be referred to as ``covered  transactions''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covered transaction. For purposes of this section, a covered  transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered  transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the  transfer of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (b)(2)  of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement  transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type,  including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships,  contracts of assistance, loans, loan Guarantees, subsidies, insurance,  payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other  nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered  transaction is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a  procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a  primary covered transaction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any procurement contract for goods or services between a  participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or  exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10  U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $100,000) under a primary  covered transaction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any procurement contract for goods or services between a  participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of  amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or  substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons may  include loan officers or chief executive officers acting as principal  investigators and providers of federally-required audit services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier  awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including  deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct awards to foreign governments or public international  organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign  governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign  government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities  consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign  governmental entities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without  regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received  in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Federal employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized  emergencies or disasters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental  operations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Other transactions where the application of this section would  be prohibited by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Board covered transactions. This section applies to the Board's  loan Guarantees, subcontracts and transactions at any tier that are  charges as direct or indirect costs, regardless of type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by  law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from  primary covered transactions as either participants or principals  throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period  of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for  debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall  enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons  during such period, except as permitted pursuant to paragraph (l) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited  by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part  9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from  participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier  covered transactions (see paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) for the  period of their exclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's  eligibility for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier  awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including  deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct awards to foreign governments or public international  organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign  governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign  government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and  entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or  foreign governmental entities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without  regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received  in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Federal employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized  emergencies or disasters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental  operations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other transactions where the application of this section would  be prohibited by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Persons who are ineligible are excluded in accordance with the  applicable statutory, executive order, or regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Persons who accept voluntary exclusions are excluded in  accordance with the terms of their settlements. The Board shall, and  participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain the  extent of the exclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Board may grant an exception permitting a debarred,  suspended, or voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for  debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a  particular covered transaction upon a written determination by the  agency head or an authorized designee stating the reason(s) for  deviating from the Presidential policy established by Executive Order  12549. However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in  the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently.  Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with the Executive Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment  under   48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary  exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and participants may  continue covered transactions in existence at the time the person was  debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart  9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A decision as to the  type of termination action, if any, to be taken should be made only  after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered  transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is  debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart  9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in paragraph  (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Except as permitted paragraphs (h) or (i) of this section, a  participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction  with a person who is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Debarred or suspended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered  transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Violation of the restriction under paragraph (k) of this section  may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award,  issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other  remedies as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective  participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its  principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48  CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the  covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is  erroneous. An agency has the burden of proof that a participant did  knowingly do business with a person that filed an erroneous  certification.</p>
