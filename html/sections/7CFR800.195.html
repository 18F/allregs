Each applicant for authority to operate as a delegated State shall be reviewed to determine whether the applicant meets the eligibility conditions contained in paragraph (c) of this section and the criteria contained in section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act.

The State shall perform each official service according to the Act, regulations, and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Staffing, licensing, and training. Delegated States shall employ official personnel on the basis of job qualifications rather than political affiliations. The State shall employ sufficient personnel to provide the services normally requested in an accurate and timely manner. The State shall only use personnel licensed by the Service for the performance of official services and shall train and assist its personnel in acquiring and maintaining the necessary skills. The State shall keep the Service informed of the employment status of each of its licensees and any substantial change in a licensee's duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rotation of personnel.

The State and its officials shall be responsible for the actions of the official personnel employed by the State, for direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for the conduct of official services

and related activities in the State. The State shall supervise official activities according to the Act, regulations, and instructions and shall take action necessary to ensure that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and are not involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or instructions. Each State shall report to the Service information which shows or may show a violation of any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions and information on any instructions which have been issued to State personnel by Service personnel or by any other person which are contrary to or inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Conflict of interest. (i) General. The delegated State and any commissioner, director, employee, or other related person or entity shall not have a conflict of interest, as defined in section 11 of the Act and Sec.  800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be waived pursuant to Sec.  800.199(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unofficial activities.

Each delegated State shall maintain the records specified in Sec. Sec.  800.145 through 800.159.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Termination--(1) Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user fees prescribed by the Service for supervisory costs related to official inspection and weighing services within 30 days after due shall result in the automatic termination of the delegation. The delegation shall be reinstated if fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days after the termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary cancellation. A State may request that its delegation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revocation. (i) Without hearing. The Administrator may revoke the delegation of a State without first affording the State opportunity for a hearing. Unless otherwise provided, the revocation shall be effective when the State receives a notice from the Service regarding the revocation and the reason(s) therefor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Informal conference. At the discretion of the Administrator, before the delegation of a State is revoked under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, the Service may (A) notify the State of the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afford the State an opportunity to express its views in an informal conference before the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Provision of services following termination.
