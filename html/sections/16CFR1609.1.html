Such  guaranty shall be either (1) a separate guaranty specifically  designating the wearing apparel or fabric guaranteed, in which case it  may be on the invoice or other paper relating to such wearing apparel or  fabric; or (2) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission  applicable to any wearing apparel or fabric handled by a guarantor, in  such form as the Commission by rules or regulations may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It shall be unlawful for any person to furnish, with respect to  any wearing apparel or fabric, a false guaranty (except a person relying  upon a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by and  containing the name and address of the person by whom the wearing  apparel or fabric guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was  received) with reason to believe the wearing apparel or fabric falsely  guaranteed may be introduced, sold, or transported in commerce, and any  person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of an  unfair method of competition, and an unfair or deceptive act or  practice, in commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission  Act.</p><p class="depth2">Shipments From Foreign Countries</p><p class="depth2">Sec. 9.
