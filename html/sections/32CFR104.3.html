                            <p class="depth0">Critical mission. An operational mission that requires the skills or  resources available in a Reserve component or components.</p><p class="depth0">Critical requirement. A requirement in which the incumbent possesses  unique knowledge, extensive experience, and specialty skill training to  successfully fulfill the duties or responsibilities in support of the  mission, operation or exercise. Also, a requirement in which the  incumbent must gain the necessary experience to qualify for key senior  leadership positions within his or her Reserve component.</p><p class="depth0">Escalator position. This is established by the principle that the  returning Service member is entitled to the position of civilian  employment that he or she would have attained had he or she remained  continuously employed by that civilian employer. This may be a position  of greater or lesser responsibilities, to include a layoff status, when  compared to the employees of the same seniority and status employed by  the company.</p><p class="depth0">Impossible or unreasonable. For the purpose of determining when  providing advance notice of uniformed service to an employer is  impossible or unreasonable, the unavailability of an employer or  employer representative to whom notification can be given, an order by  competent military authority to report for uniformed service within  forty-eight hours of notification, or other circumstances that the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs may  determine are impossible or unreasonable are sufficient justification  for not providing advance notice of pending uniformed service to an  employer.</p><p class="depth0">Military necessity. For the purpose of determining when providing  advance notice of uniformed service is not required, a mission,  operation, exercise or requirement that is classified, or a pending or  ongoing mission, operation, exercise or requirement that may be  compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public knowledge is  sufficient justification for not providing advance notice to an  employer.</p><p class="depth0">Non-career service. The period of active uniformed service required  to complete the initial uniformed service obligation; a period of active  duty or full-time National Guard duty that is for a specified purpose  and duration with no expressed or implied commitment for continued  active duty; or participation in a Reserve component as a member of the  Ready Reserve performing annual training, active duty for training or  inactive duty training. Continuous or repeated active uniformed service  or full-time National Guard duty that results in eligibility for a  regular retirement from the Armed Forces is not considered non-career  service.</p><p class="depth0">Officer. For determining those Service officials authorized to  provide advance notice to a civilian employer of pending uniformed  service by a Service member or an individual who has applied for  uniformed service, an officer shall include all commissioned officers,  warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers authorized by the  Secretary concerned to act in this capacity.</p><p class="depth0">Uniformed service. Performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary  basis in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps or the  Coast Guard, including their Reserve components, when the Service member  is engaged in active duty, active duty for special work, active duty for  training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training,  annual training or full-time National Guard duty, and, for purposes of  this part, a period for which a person is absent from a position of  employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of  the person to perform such duty.</p>
