                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To assure that the Federal investment in public  telecommunications facilities funded under the Act will continue to be  used to provide public telecommunications services to the public during  the Federal interest period, the Agency may require a grantee to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Execute and record a document establishing that the Federal  government has a priority lien on any facilities purchased with funds  under the Act during the period of continuing Federal interest. The  document shall be recorded where liens are normally recorded in the  community where the facility is located and in the community where the  grantee's headquarters are located; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File a certified copy of the recorded lien with the  Administrator ninety (90) days after the grant award is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grantee shall maintain protection against common hazards  through adequate insurance coverage or other equivalent undertakings,  except that, to the extent the applicant follows a different policy of  protection with respect to its other property, the applicant may extend  such policy to apparatus acquired and installed under the project. The  grantee shall purchase flood insurance (in communities where such  insurance is available) if the facilities will be constructed in any  area that has been identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  as having special flood hazards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The grantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other  interests in the equipment acquired under this grant during the Federal  interest period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee shall demonstrate that the grantee has obtained  appropriate title or lease satisfactory to protect the Federal interest  to the site or sites on which apparatus proposed in the project will be  operated. The grantee must have the right to occupy, construct,  maintain, operate, inspect, and remove the project equipment without  impediment to assure the sufficient continuity of operation of the  facility; and nothing must prevent the Federal government from entering  the property and reclaiming or securing PTFP-funded property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Agency will allow the acquisition of facilities by lease;  however, the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lease must be of benefit to the Federal government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The actual amount of the lease must not be more than the  outright purchase price would be; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lease agreement must state that in the event of anticipated  or actual termination of the lease, the Federal government has the right  to transfer and assign the leasehold to a new grantee for the duration  of the lease contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfer of equipment. Where the grant equipment is no longer  needed for the original purposes of the project, the Department may  transfer the   equipment to the Federal government or an eligible third party, in  accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer of Federal interest to different equipment. The  Department may transfer the Federal interest in PTFP-funded equipment to  other eligible equipment presently owned or to be purchased by the  grantee with non-Federal monies, provided the following conditions are  met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Federal interest is to be transferred to other equipment  presently owned or to be purchased by a grantee, the Federal interest in  the new equipment must be at least equal to the Federal interest in the  original equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment previously funded by PTFP that is within the Federal  interest period may not be used in a transfer request as the designated  equipment to which the Federal interest is to be transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The same item can be used only once to substitute for the  Federal interest. However, the Federal interest in several items of  equipment from different grants may be transferred to a single item if  the request for all such transfers is submitted at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A lien on equipment transferred to the Federal interest may be  required by PTFP and must be recorded in accordance with Sec.  2301.23(b)(8). A copy of the lien document must be filed with the PTFP  within sixty (60) days of the date of approval of the transfer of  Federal interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Termination by buy-out. A grantee may terminate the Federal  revisionary interest in a PTFP grant by buying out the Federal interest  with non-Federal monies. Buy-outs may be requested at any time.</p>
