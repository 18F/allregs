                            <p class="depth0">In order to deal with unusual circumstances and to allow growth in the EIAP process, SAF/IEI may grant waivers to those procedures contained in this part not required by NEPA or the CEQ Regulations. Such waivers shall not be used to limit compliance with NEPA or the CEQ Regulations but only to substitute other, more suitable procedures relative to the context of the particular action. Such waivers may also be granted on occasion to allow experimentation in procedures in order to allow growth in the EIAP. This authority may not be delegated.
