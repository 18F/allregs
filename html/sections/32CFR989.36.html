Such  waivers shall not be used to limit compliance with NEPA or the CEQ  Regulations but only to substitute other, more suitable procedures  relative to the context of the particular action. Such waivers may also  be granted on occasion to allow experimentation in procedures in order  to allow growth in the EIAP. This authority may not be delegated.
