                                Sec. 424.11  Factors for listing, delisting, or reclassifying species.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any species or taxonomic group of species (e.g., genus,  subgenus) as defined in Sec. 424.02(k) is eligible for listing under  the Act. A taxon of higher rank than species may be listed only if all  included species are individually found to be endangered or threatened.  In determining whether a particular taxon or population is a species for  the purposes of the Act, the Secretary shall rely on standard taxonomic  distinctions and the biological expertise of the Department and the  scientific community concerning the relevant taxonomic group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary shall make any determination required by  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section solely on the basis of the best  available scientific and commercial information regarding a species'  status, without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A species shall be listed or reclassified if the Secretary  determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data  available after conducting a review of the species' status, that the  species is endangered or threatened because of any one or a combination  of the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or  curtailment of its habitat or range;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Over utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or  educational purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disease or predation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued  existence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The factors considered in delisting a species are those in  paragraph (c) of this section as they relate to the definitions of  endangered or threatened species. Such removal must be supported by the  best scientific and commercial data available to the Secretary after  conducting a review of the status of the species. A species may be  delisted only if such data substantiate that it is neither endangered  nor threatened for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extinction. Unless all individuals of the listed species had  been previously identified and located, and were later found to be  extirpated from their previous range, a sufficient period of time must  be allowed before delisting to indicate clearly that the species is  extinct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recovery. The principal goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service is to return listed  species to a point at which protection under the Act is no longer  required. A species may be   delisted on the basis of recovery only if the best scientific and  commercial data available indicate that it is no longer endangered or  threatened.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Original data for classification in error. Subsequent  investigations may show that the best scientific or commercial data  available when the species was listed, or the interpretation of such  data, were in error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The fact that a species of fish, wildlife, or plant is protected  by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild  Fauna and Flora (see part 23 of this title 50) or a similar  international agreement on such species, or has been identified as  requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation,  or to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the  foreseeable future by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign  nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish, wildlife, or  plants, may constitute evidence that the species is endangered or  threatened. The weight given such evidence will vary depending on the  international agreement in question, the criteria pursuant to which the  species is eligible for protection under such authorities, and the  degree of protection afforded the species. The Secretary shall give  consideration to any species protected under such an international  agreement, or by any State or foreign nation, to determine whether the  species is endangered or threatened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Secretary shall take into account, in making determinations  under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, those efforts, if any, being  made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a  State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator  control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation  practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.</p>
