Contracting responsibility is assigned through--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Coordinated Acquisition Program (commodity assignments are listed in PGI 208.7006); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Integrated Materiel Management Program (assignments are in DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items).

208.7001  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart--</p><p class="depth0">Acquiring department means the department, agency, or General Services Administration which has contracting responsibility under the Coordinated Acquisition Program.</p><p class="depth0">Integrated materiel management means assignment of acquisition management responsibility to one department, agency, or the General Services Administration for all of DoD's requirements for the assigned item. Acquisition management normally includes computing requirements, funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and contracting functions.</p><p class="depth0">Requiring department means the department or agency which has the requirement for an item.


208.7002  Assignment authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a single department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). Commodity assignments are made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To the departments and agencies, by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Outside the contiguous United States, by the Unified Commanders; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For acquisitions to be made in the contiguous United States for commodities not assigned under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, by agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 2311).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The submission of a military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) by a requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of another department, even though based on an oral communication, constitutes a one-time agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and distribute them to all activities concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments are made by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To the departments and agencies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To GSA, through agreement with GSA.
