When NRCS finds

that a participant is not operating and maintaining practices installed through the CSP in an appropriate manner, NRCS will initiate contract violation procedures as specified in Sec. 1469.25. If an existing practice is part of a system that meets the quality criteria, but does not technically meet NRCS minimum practice standards, the practice must be modified or updated to meet the standard according the FOTG as specified in Sec. 1469.25(a) of this part.</p>
