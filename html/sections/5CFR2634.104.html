                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Title I of the Act requires that high-level Federal officials disclose

publicly their personal financial interests, to ensure confidence in the integrity of the Federal Government by demonstrating that they are able to carry out their duties without compromising the public trust. Title I also authorizes the Office of Government Ethics to establish a confidential (nonpublic) financial disclosure system for less senior executive branch personnel in certain designated positions, to facilitate internal agency conflict-of-interest review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public and confidential financial disclosure serves to prevent conflicts of interest and to identify potential conflicts, by providing for a systematic review of the financial interests of both current and prospective officers and employees. These reports assist agencies in administering their ethics programs and providing counseling to employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial disclosure reports are not net worth statements. Financial disclosure systems seek only the information that the President, Congress, or OGE as the supervising ethics office for the executive branch has deemed relevant to the administration and application of the criminal conflict of interest laws, other statutes on ethical conduct or financial interests, and Executive orders or regulations on standards of ethical conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in the Act or this part requiring reporting of information or the filing of any report shall be deemed to authorize receipt of income, honoraria, gifts, or reimbursements; holding of assets, liabilities, or positions; or involvement in transactions that are prohibited by law, Executive order or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of title I of the Act and this part requiring the reporting of information shall supersede any general requirement under any other provision of law or regulation on the reporting of information required for purposes of preventing conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts of interest. However, the provisions of title I and this part shall not supersede the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7342 (the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This regulation is intended to be gender-neutral; therefore, use of the terms he, his, and him include she, hers, and her, and vice versa.</p>
