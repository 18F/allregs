If more than one tangible gift is presented at or marks an event, the value of all such gifts must not exceed ``minimal value.''

Tangible gifts are considered to have been accepted on behalf of the United States and become the property of the United States on acceptance. Accordingly, they must be deposited and documented in accordance with Sec.  264b.6(a) and can only be returned or otherwise processed by the Office of the Secretary under Sec.  264b.8.
