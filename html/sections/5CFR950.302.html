If the  Director requests information supporting a certification of eligibility,  that information shall be furnished promptly. Failure to furnish such  information within 10 business days of the receipt of the request  constitutes grounds for the denial of national eligibility of that  member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each federation, as fiscal agent for its member organizations,  must ensure that Federal employee designations are honored in that each  member organization receives its proportionate share of receipts based  on the results of each individual campaign. The proportionate share of  receipts is determined by donor designations to the individual member  organization as compared to total campaign designations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federations must disburse CFC funds to each member organization  without any further deductions. Membership dues, fees, or other charges  to member organizations must be assessed outside of the CFC disbursement  process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federations must disburse CFC funds to member organizations on a  quarterly basis, at a minimum. The disbursements must be made within the  months of June, September, December, and March.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disbursements to federation members that include funds from a  non- CFC campaign must include a report that clearly identifies the  amount of CFC funds.</p>
