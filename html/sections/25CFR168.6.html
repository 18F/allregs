                            <p class="depth0">Grazing use on range units is authorized only by permits granted  under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grazing permits to Hopi tribal members on their partitioned  lands. The Area Director shall assign grazing privileges to the Hopi  Tribe for lands within Hopi Partitioned Lands. The tribal government  will then allocate use to their tribal members for permit periods not to  exceed five years. Grazing use by Hopi tribal enterprises may be  authorized. The Area Director will issue permits based on the  determination of the Hopi tribal government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interim Grazing Permit for persons awaiting relocation. Navajo  Tribal members who have maintained both a permanent residence on Hopi  Partitioned lands; a livestock inventory since enumeration; and meet all  the criteria listed in Sec. 168.1(o), shall be eligible for an interim  grazing allocation on Hopi Partitioned Lands under the following terms  and conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Area Director shall first verify that an applicant meets the  criteria of the definition in Sec. 168.1(o) and will issue all permits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The permitted number shall not exceed either (i) 10 SUYL (See  Sec. 168.1(1)) for each eligible family member, or (ii) the grazing  applicant's livestock inventory reduced by voluntary sales as adjusted  by reproduction, in accordance with procedures developed by the Project  Officer based upon the study by Stubblefield and Camfield, 1975 page 5.  The determination of the person to whom permits will be issued and the  number of livestock to be permitted will be based on information  provided by the permit applicant and an assessment of the number of  dependents residing in the immediate household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The permit shall authorize grazing for a specific number and  kind of animal(s) in a specified range unit. Interim grazing permits  will not be issued in excess of one-half the authorized carrying  capacity of the Hopi Partition area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subject to the provisions of Sec. 168.9(b), permits shall  expire when the person awaiting relocation is relocated pursuant to the  Settlement Act. No interim permit will be issued for a term greater than  one year. Permits may be reissued upon application and redetermination  of eligibility. All interim permits will expire at the end of the period  provided for completion of relocation, Pub. L. 99-190. When a Navajo  permit holder discontinues grazing livestock or reduces the number being  grazed whether by reason of his relocating or for any other reason, his  grazing permit will be cancelled or reduced and no permit will be issued  in lieu thereof. The total number of authorized animal units grazed by  the Navajo permit holders awaiting relocation will reduced by the number  of animal units authorized under the cancelled or reduced permit.
