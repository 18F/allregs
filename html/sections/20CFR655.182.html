                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debarment of an employer. The OFLC Administrator may debar an employer or any successor in interest to that employer from receiving future labor certifications under this subpart, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, if the OFLC Administrator finds that the employer substantially violated a material term or condition of its temporary labor certification, with respect to H-2A workers, workers in corresponding employment, or U.S. workers improperly rejected for employment, or improperly laid off or displaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debarment of an agent or attorney. The OFLC Administrator may debar an agent or attorney from participating in any action under 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or 29 CFR part 501, if the OFLC Administrator finds that the agent or attorney participated in an employer's substantial violation. The OFLC Administrator may not issue future labor certifications under this subpart to any employer represented by a debarred agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statute of limitations and period of debarment. (1) The OFLC Administrator must issue any Notice of Debarment no later than 2 years after the occurrence of the violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OFLC Administrator must issue any Notice of Debarment no later than 2 years after the occurrence of the violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No employer, attorney, or agent may be debarred under this subpart for more than 3 years from the date of the final agency decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition of violation. For the purposes of this section, a violation includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One or more acts of commission or omission on the part of the employer or the employer's agent which involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits or working conditions to the employer's H-2A workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the WHD Administrator for violation(s) of contractual or other H-2A obligations, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Impeding an investigation of an employer under 8 U.S.C. 1188 or 29 CFR part 501, or an audit under Sec. 655.180 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Employing an H-2A worker outside the area of intended employment, in an activity/activities not listed in the job order or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A violation of the requirements of Sec. 655.135(j) or (k);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A violation of any of the provisions listed in 29 CFR 501.4(a); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A single heinous act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program requirements cannot reasonably be expected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer's failure to pay a necessary certification fee in a timely manner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fraud involving the Application for Temporary Employment Certification; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A material misrepresentation of fact during the application process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determining whether a violation is substantial. In determining whether a violation is so substantial so as to merit debarment, the factors the OFLC Administrator may consider include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous history of violation(s) of 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, or this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of H-2A workers, workers in corresponding employment, or U.S. workers who were and/or are affected by the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gravity of the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Efforts made in good faith to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1188, 29 CFR part 501, and this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Explanation from the person charged with the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Commitment to future compliance, taking into account the public health, interest, or safety, and whether the person has previously violated 8 U.S.C. 1188;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation(s), or the potential financial loss or potential injury to the worker(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Debarment procedure--(1) Notice of Debarment. If the OFLC Administrator makes a determination to debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the OFLC Administrator will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The Notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment, and it will inform the party subject to the Notice of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or to request a debarment hearing. If the party does not file rebuttal evidence or request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the Notice will be the final agency action and the debarment will take effect at the end of the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of Debarment. If the OFLC Administrator makes a determination to debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the OFLC Administrator will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The Notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment, and it will inform the party subject to the Notice of its right to submit rebuttal evidence or to request a debarment hearing. If the party does not file rebuttal evidence or request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the Notice will be the final agency action and the debarment will take effect at the end of the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttal. The party who received the Notice of Debarment may choose to submit evidence to rebut the grounds stated in the Notice within 30 calendar days of the date the Notice is issued. If rebuttal evidence is timely filed, the OFLC Administrator will issue a final determination on the debarment within 30 days of receiving the rebuttal evidence. If the OFLC Administrator determines that the party should be debarred, the OFLC Administrator will inform the party of its right to request a debarment hearing according to the procedures of Sec. 655.182(f)(3). The party must request a hearing within 30 calendar days after the date of the OFLC Administrator's final determination, or the OFLC Administrator's determination will be the final agency order and the debarment will take effect at the end of the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hearing. The recipient of a Notice of Debarment may request a debarment hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of a Notice of Debarment or the date of a final determination of the OFLC Administrator after review of rebuttal evidence submitted pursuant to Sec. 655.182(f)(2). To obtain a debarment hearing, the debarred party must, within 30 days of the date of the Notice or the final determination, file a written request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street, NW., Suite 400-N, Washington, DC 20001-8002, and simultaneously serve a copy to the OFLC Administrator. The debarment will take effect 30 days from the date the Notice of Debarment or final determination is issued, unless a request for review is properly filed within 30 days from the issuance of the Notice of Debarment or final determination. The timely filing of a request for a hearing stays the debarment pending the outcome of the hearing. Within 10 days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the OFLC Administrator will send a certified copy of the ETA case file to the Chief ALJ by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The Chief ALJ will immediately assign an ALJ to conduct the hearing. The procedures in 29 CFR part 18 apply to such hearings, except that the request for a hearing will not be considered to be a complaint to which an answer is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Decision. After the hearing, the ALJ must affirm, reverse, or modify the OFLC Administrator's determination. The ALJ will prepare the decision

within 60 days after completion of the hearing and closing of the record. The ALJ's decision will be provided immediately to the parties to the debarment hearing by means normally assuring next-day delivery. The ALJ's decision is the final agency action, unless either party, within 30 calendar days of the ALJ's decision, seeks review of the decision with the Administrative Review Board (ARB).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Review by the ARB. (i) Any party wishing review of the decision of an ALJ must, within 30 days of the decision of the ALJ, petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition must be served on all parties and on the ALJ. The ARB will decide whether to accept the petition within 30 days of receipt. If the ARB declines to accept the petition, or if the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition within 30 days after the receipt of a timely filing of the petition, the decision of the ALJ will be deemed the final agency action. If a petition for review is accepted, the decision of the ALJ will be stayed unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the decision. The ARB must serve notice of its decision to accept or not to accept the petition upon the ALJ and upon all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any party wishing review of the decision of an ALJ must, within 30 days of the decision of the ALJ, petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition must be served on all parties and on the ALJ. The ARB will decide whether to accept the petition within 30 days of receipt. If the ARB declines to accept the petition, or if the ARB does not issue a notice accepting a petition within 30 days after the receipt of a timely filing of the petition, the decision of the ALJ will be deemed the final agency action. If a petition for review is accepted, the decision of the ALJ will be stayed unless and until the ARB issues an order affirming the decision. The ARB must serve notice of its decision to accept or not to accept the petition upon the ALJ and upon all parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon receipt of the ARB's notice to accept the petition, the Office of Administrative Law Judges will promptly forward a copy of the complete hearing record to the ARB.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where the ARB has determined to review such decision and order, the ARB will notify each party of the issue(s) raised, the form in which submissions must be made (e.g., briefs or oral argument), and the time within which such presentation must be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ARB decision. The ARB's final decision must be issued within 90 days from the notice granting the petition and served upon all parties and the ALJ. If the ARB fails to provide a decision within 90 days from the notice granting the petition, the ALJ's decision will be the final agency decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Concurrent debarment jurisdiction. OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction to impose a debarment remedy under this section or under 29 CFR 501.20. When considering debarment, OFLC and the WHD may inform one another and may coordinate their activities. A specific violation for which debarment is imposed will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Debarment involving members of associations. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an individual employer-member of a joint employer association has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to that member unless the OFLC Administrator determines that the association or another association member participated in the violation, in which case the debarment will be invoked against the association or other complicit association member(s) as well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Debarment involving associations acting as joint employers. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an association acting as a joint employer with its members has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the association, and will not be applied to any individual employer-member of the association. However, if the OFLC Administrator determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the violation, the debarment may be invoked against the complicit association member as well. An association debarred from the H-2A temporary labor certification program will not be permitted to continue to file as a joint employer with its members during the period of the debarment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Debarment involving associations acting as sole employers. If the OFLC Administrator determines that an association acting as a sole employer has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the association and any successor in interest to the debarred association.</p>
