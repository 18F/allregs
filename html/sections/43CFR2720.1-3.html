                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 90 days of receipt of an application to purchase  federally-owned mineral interests, the authorized officer shall, if the  application meets the requirements for further processing, determine the  amount of deposit required and so inform the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No application filed under this subpart shall be processed until  the applicant has either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deposited with the authorized officer an amount of money that  the authorized officer estimates is needed to cover administrative costs  of processing, including, but not limited to, costs of conducting an  exploratory program, if one is required, to determine the character of  the mineral deposits in the land, evaluating the existing data [or the  data obtained under an approved exploratory program] to aid in  determining the fair market value of the mineral interests to be  conveyed, and preparing and issuing the documents of conveyance, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has obtained the consent of the authorized officer to conduct an  exploratory program, such program to be conducted only under a plan of  operations approved by the authorized officer and deposited with the  authorized officer an amount of money the authorized officer estimates  is needed to cover administrative costs of processing, including, but  not limited to, costs of evaluating existing data and data submitted  from an approved exploratory program to determine the fair market value  of the mineral interests to be conveyed and preparing and issuing the  documents of conveyance.</p><p class="depth3">The authorized officer, in reaching a determination as to whether  there are any known mineral values in the land and, if so, the estimated  costs of an exploratory program, if one is needed, will rely upon  reports on minerals prepared by or reviewed and approved by the Bureau  of Land Management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The authorized officer shall inform the applicant of his  determination as to the need for an exploratory program, and where  appropriate, the estimated cost of such a program. The applicant may  request that the exploratory program be arranged by the authorized  officer or request the consent of the authorized officer to accomplish  any required exploratory program by other means, at his own expense,  under a plan of operations approved by the authorized officer and to  provide the results to the authorized officer for his use and approval.  The applicant shall, within 60 days of receipt of such notice, or any  extension thereof, respond to the authorized officer's notice, stating  whether he wishes to have the authorized officer arrange to have  conducted the required exploratory program or requests the consent of  the authorized officer to accomplish any required exploratory program by  other means. Failure to respond to said notice shall void the  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the applicant requests that any required exploratory program  be arranged by the authorized officer, he shall submit the sum of money  required under paragraph (b) of this section and the authorized officer  shall   have the exploratory program accomplished so as to aid in determining  the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests covered by the  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the applicant requests the consent of the authorized officer  to accomplish any required exploratory program by other means, at his  own expense, he shall at the time of making his request for such  consent, file a plan of operations to carry out any required exploratory  program for approval by the authorized officer. Such plan of operations  shall be sufficient to provide the resource and economic data needed to  aid in determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral  interests to be conveyed. Said resource and economic data shall include,  where appropriate, but not be limited to, geologic maps, geologic cross- sections, tables and descriptive information encompassing lithologic,  geochemical, and geophysical data, assays of samples, drill logs and  outcrop sections, which aid in establishing the location, nature,  quantity, and grade, and which aid in determining the fair market value  of the Federal mineral interests in the land covered by the application.  The plan of operations shall conform to the laws, regulations and  ordinances of all governmental bodies having jurisdiction over the lands  covered by the application. The authorized officer shall decide within  90 days of receipt of said request whether he shall or shall not give  his consent. The authorized officer shall not give his consent if he  determines that the plan of operations is not adequate to supply the  resource and economic data needed to aid him in determining the fair  market value of the Federal mineral interests to be conveyed. If the  authorized officer, in his discretion, approves the applicant's plan of  operations, the applicant may proceed to execute the plan of operations,  subject to the supervision of the authorized officer. If the authorized  officer does not give his consent to the applicant's request, the  applicant may, within 60 days of such refusal, avail himself of the  provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. Failure to deposit the  required sum within the 60 day period shall void the application. All  resource and economic data obtained from the approved exploratory  program shall be supplied the authorized officer. The authorized officer  shall supply that data needed for determination of the economic value of  mineral resources to the Bureau of Land Management. The authorized  officer relying upon those determinations shall determine the fair  market value of the Federal mineral interests in the land covered by the  application. If the authorized officer determines that the resource and  economic data supplied from an approved exploratory program is not  adequate to aid in determining the fair market value of the Federal  mineral interests to be conveyed, he shall so notify the applicant and  state what additional data is needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of  this section, an application may be rejected without the applicant  meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the  authorized officer determines from an examination of the application or  of data readily available to him relating to the land concerned that the  application does not meet the requirements of the Act.
