                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Jackknives are not ordinarily subjected to regularly  scheduled factory inspections, but the Commander of the Coast Guard  District in which they are manufactured may detail an inspector at any  time to places where jackknives are manufactured to check materials and  construction methods, and to conduct such tests as may be required to  satisfy himself that jackknives are being manufactured in compliance  with the requirements of this specification and the manufacturer's plans  and specifications as approved by the Commandant. The manufacturer shall  admit the inspector to his plant and shall provide a suitable place and  the necessary apparatus for use of the inspector in conducting tests at  the place of manufacture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hardness test. Hardness of the blade, can opener, and spring  metal shall be determined in accordance with the Rockwell method as  described in Federal Specification QQ-M-151. Hardness impressions shall  be made at locations representing the cutting edges and surfaces subject  to wear, and they shall fall within the ranges set forth in Sec.  160.043-3(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bending and drop tests. With all of the blade of the knife  except the tang clamped in vertical jaws so that the handle is in a  horizontal position, a downward load of 15 pounds shall be suspended  from the lanyard and allowed to hang for a period of 5 minutes. The  knife shall then be turned over, and the test repeated with the can  opener in the jaws. The knife shall then be dropped on its side from a  height of 8 feet onto a concrete floor. Both the blade and the can  opener shall open and close properly, and the knife shall show no other  evidence of failure at the conclusion of these tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cutting test. The knife shall be used to cut various nonmetallic  objects, including at least 10 shavings from a strip of oak or other  hardwood, and to open various rectangular and circular cans, and shall  show no noticeable loss in cutting ability.</p>
