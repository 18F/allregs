                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review. When funds are made available for assistance, HUD will  publish a notice of funding availability (NOFA) in the Federal Register  in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 4. HUD will review  and screen   applications in accordance with the guidelines, rating criteria, and  procedures published in the NOFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ACC Execution. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before execution of the annual contributions  contract (ACC), the HA must submit to the appropriate HUD field office  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Estimates of Required Annual Contributions, Forms HUD-52672 and  HUD-52673;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Administrative Plan, which should include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Procedures for tenant outreach;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A policy governing temporary relocation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A mechanism to monitor the provision of supportive services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proposed Schedule of Allowances for Tenant-Furnished Utilities  and Other Services, Form HUD-52667, with a justification of the amounts  proposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If applicable, proposed variations to the acceptability  criteria of the Housing Quality Standards (see Sec. 882.803(b)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The fire and building code applicable to each structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After HUD has approved the HA's application, the review and  comment requirements of 24 CFR part 791 have been complied with, and the  HA has submitted (and HUD has approved) the items required by paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, HUD and the HA must execute the ACC in the form  prescribed by HUD. The initial term of the ACC must be 11 years. This  term allows one year to rehabilitate the units and place them under a  10-year HAP contract. The ACC must give HUD the option to renew the ACC  for an additional 10 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 882.403(a) (Maximum Total ACC Commitments) applies to  this program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 882.403(b) (Project account) applies to this program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an owner is proposing to accomplish at least $3000 per  unit of rehabilitation by including work to make the unit(s) accessible  to a person with disabilities occupying the unit(s) or expected to  occupy the unit(s), the PHA may approve such units not to exceed 5  percent of the units under its Program, provided that accessible units  are necessary to meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 8, which  implements section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The  rehabilitation must make the unit(s), and access and egress to the  unit(s), barrier-free with respect to the disability of the individual  in residence or expected to be in residence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PHA must take the applications and determine the eligibility  of all tenants residing in the approved units who wish to apply for the  Program. After eligibility of all the tenants has been determined, the  Owner must be informed of any adjustment in the number of units to be  assisted. In order to make the most efficient use of housing assistance  funds, an Agreement may not be entered into covering any unit occupied  by a family which is not eligible to receive housing assistance  payments. Therefore, the number of units approved by the PHA for a  particular proposal must be adjusted to exclude any unit(s) determined  by the PHA to be occupied by a family not eligible to receive housing  assistance payments. Eligible Families must also be briefed at this  stage as to their rights and responsibilities under the Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Should the Owner agree with the assessment of the PHA as to the  work that must be accomplished, the preliminary feasibility of the  proposal, and the number of units to be assisted, the Owner, with the  assistance of the PHA where necessary, must prepare detailed work write- ups including specifications and plans (where necessary) so that a cost  estimate may be prepared. The work write-up will describe how the  deficiencies eligible for amortization through the Contract Rents are to  be corrected including minimum acceptable levels of workmanship and  materials. From this work write-up, the Owner, with the assistance of  the PHA, must prepare a cost estimate for the accomplishment of all  specified items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner is responsible for selecting a competent contractor to  undertake the rehabilitation. The PHA must propose opportunities for  minority contractors to participate in the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The PHA must discuss with the Owner the various financing  options available. The terms of the financing   must be approved by the PHA in accordance with standards prescribed by  HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Before execution of the Agreement, the HA must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Inspect the structure to determine the specific work items  that need to be accomplished to bring the units to be assisted up to the  Housing Quality Standards (see Sec. 882.803(b)) or other standards  approved by HUD;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Conduct a feasibility analysis, and determine whether cost- effective energy conserving improvements can be added;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Ensure that the owner prepares the work write-ups and cost  estimates required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Determine initial base rents and contract rents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assure that the owner has selected a contractor in accordance  with paragraph (c)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After the financing and a contractor are obtained, determine  whether the costs can be covered by initial contract rents, computed in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and, if a structure  contains more than 50 units to be assisted, submit the base rent and  contract rent calculations to the appropriate HUD field office for  review and approval in sufficient time for execution of the Agreement in  a timely manner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Obtain firm commitments to provide necessary supportive  services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Obtain firm commitments for other resources to be provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Determine that the $3,000 minimum amount of work requirement  and other requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Determine eligibility of current tenants, and select the units  to be assisted, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Comply with the financing requirements in paragraph (c)(5) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Assure compliance with all other applicable requirements of  this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> If the HA determines that any structure proposed in its  application is infeasible, or the HA proposes to select a different  structure for any other reason, the HA must submit information for the  proposed alternative structure to HUD for review and approval. HUD will  rate the proposed structure in accordance with procedures in the  applicable notice of funding availability. The HA may not proceed with  processing for the proposed structure or execute an Agreement until HUD  notifies the HA that HUD has approved the proposed alternative structure  and that all requirements have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Initial contract rents. Section 882.408 (Initial contract  rents), including the establishment of fair market rents for SRO units  at 75 percent of the O-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent,  applies to this program, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In determining the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan, in  accordance with Sec. 882.408(c)(2), a loan term of a least 10 years  (instead of 15 years) may be used. The exception in Sec.  882.408(c)(2)(iii) for using the actual loan term if the total amount of  the rehabilitation is less than $15,000 continues to apply. In addition,  the cost of the rehabilitation that may be included for the purpose of  calculating the amount of the initial contract rent for any unit must  not exceed the lower of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The projected cost of rehabilitation; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> of this section by an amount HUD  determines is reasonable and necessary to accommodate special local  conditions, including high construction costs or stringent fire or  building codes. HUD will publish future cost limitation changes in the  Federal Register in the Notice of Funding Availability issued each year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) believes that high  construction costs warrant an increase in the per unit cost limitation  in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the HA must demonstrate to  HUD's satisfaction that a higher average per unit amount is necessary to  conduct this program, and that every appropriate step has been taken to  contain the   amount of the rehabilitation within the published per unit cost  limitation established at that time, plus the cost of the required fire  and safety improvements. These higher amounts will be determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> HUD may approve a higher per unit amount up to, but not to  exceed, an amount computed by multiplying the HUD-approved High Cost  Percentage for Base Cities (used for computing FHA high cost area  adjustments) for the area, by the current published cost limitation plus  the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> HUD may, on a structure-by-structure basis, increase the level  approved in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to up to an amount  computed by multiplying 2.4 by the current published cost limitation  plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In approving changes to initial contract rents during  rehabilitation in accordance with Sec. 882.408(d), the revised initial  contract rents may not reflect an average per unit rehabilitation cost  that exceeds the limitation specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the structure contains four or fewer SRO units, the Fair  Market Rent for that size structure (the Fair Market Rent for a 1-, 2-,  3-, or 4-bedroom unit, as applicable) must be used to determine the Fair  Market Rent limitation instead of using the separate Fair Market Rent  for each SRO unit. To determine the Fair Market Rent limitation for each  SRO unit, the Fair Market Rent for the structure must be apportioned  equally to each SRO unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contract rents must not include the costs of providing  supportive services, transportation, furniture, or other nonhousing  costs, as determined by HUD. SRO program assistance may be used for  efficiency units selected for rehabilitation under this program, but the  gross rent (contract rent plus any Utility Allowance) for these units  will be no higher than for SRO units (i.e., 75 percent of the 0-bedroom  Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent).
