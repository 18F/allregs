Such a request shall set forth in  detail the matter alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification.  Denial of a request by the Center or other appointing authority shall be  substantiated in writing and transmitted to the requesting party, and  shall be submitted to the panel together with the complete report of the  investigator required in Sec. 269b.240(b).</p>
