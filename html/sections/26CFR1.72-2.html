                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contracts. (1) The contracts under which amounts paid will be  subject to the provisions of section 72 include contracts which are  considered to be life insurance, endowment, and annuity contracts in  accordance with the customary practice of life insurance companies. For  the purposes of section 72, however, it is immaterial whether such  contracts are entered into with an insurance company. The term  ``endowment contract'' also includes the ``face-amount certificates''  described in section 72</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If two or more annuity obligations or elements to which section  72 applies are acquired for a single consideration, such as an  obligation to pay an annuity to A for his life accompanied by an  obligation to pay an annuity to B for his life, there being a single  consideration paid for both obligations (whether paid by one or more  persons in equal or different amounts, and whether paid in a single sum  or otherwise), such annuity elements shall be considered to comprise a  single contract for the purpose of the application of section 72 and the  regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the allocation of  investment in the contract in the case of annuity elements payable to  two or more persons, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sections 402 and 403 provide that certain distributions by  employees' trusts and certain payments under employee plans are taxable  under section 72. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964,  section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, does not apply to such  distributions or payments. For purposes of applying section 72 to such  distributions and payments (other than those described in subdivision  (iii) of this subparagraph), each separate program of the employer  consisting of interrelated contributions and benefits shall be  considered a single contract. Therefore, all distributions or payments  (other than those described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph)  which are attributable to a separate program of interrelated  contributions and benefits are considered as received under a single  contract. A separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits  may be financed by the purchase from an insurance company of one or more  group contracts or one or more individual contracts, or may be financed  partly by the purchase of contracts from an insurance company and partly  through an investment fund, or may be financed completely through an  investment fund. A program may be considered   separate for purposes of section 72 although it is only a part of a plan  which qualifies under section 401. There may be several trusts under one  separate program, or several separate programs may make use of a single  trust. See, however, subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for rules  relating to what constitutes a ``contract'' for purposes of applying  section 72 to distributions commencing before October 20, 1960.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following types of benefits, and the contributions used to  provide them, are examples of separate programs of interrelated  contributions and benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitely determinable retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitely determinable benefits payable prior to retirement in  case of disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Life insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Accident and health insurance.  However, retirement benefits and life insurance will be considered part  of a single separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits  to the extent they are provided under retirement income, endowment, or  other contracts providing life insurance protection. See examples (6),  (7), and (8) contained in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph for  illustrations of the principles of this subdivision. See, also, Sec.  1.72-15 for rules relating to the taxation of amounts received under an  employee plan which provides both retirement benefits and accident and  health benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If any amount which is taxable under section 72 by reason of  section 402 or 403 is actually distributed or made available to any  person under an employees' trust or plan (other than the Civil Service  Retirement Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 14) before October 20, 1960, section 72  shall, notwithstanding any other provisions in this subparagraph, be  applied to all the distributions with respect to such person (or his  beneficiaries) under such trust or plan (whether received before or  after October 20, 1960) as though such distributions were provided under  a single contract. For purposes of applying section 72 to distributions  to which this subdivision applies, therefore, the term ``contract''  shall be considered to include the entire interest of an employee in  each trust or plan described in sections 402 and 403 to the extent that  distributions thereunder are subject to the provisions of section 72.  Section 72 shall be applied to distributions received under the Civil  Service Retirement Act in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph (see example (4) in subdivision (iv) of this  subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 1961, X Corporation established a  noncontributory profit-sharing plan for its employees providing that the  amount standing to the account of each participant will be paid to him  at the time of his retirement and also established a contributory  pension plan for its employees providing for the payment to each  participant of a lifetime pension after retirement. The profit-sharing  plan is designed to enable the employees to participate in the profits  of X Corporation; the amount of the contributions to it are determined  by reference to the profits of X Corporation; and the amount of any  distribution is determined by reference to the amount of contributions  made on behalf of any participant and the earnings thereon. On the other  hand, the pension plan is designed to provide a lifetime pension for a  retired employee; the amount of the pension is to be determined by a  formula set forth in the plan; and the amount of contributions to the  plan is the amount necessary to provide such pensions. In view of the  fact that each of these plans constitutes a separate program of  interrelated contributions and benefits, the distributions from each  shall be treated as received under a separate contract. If these plans  had been established before October 20, 1960, then, in the case of an  employee who receives a distribution under the plans before October 20,  1960, the determination as to whether that distribution and all  subsequent distributions to such employee are received under a single  contract or under more than one contract shall be made by applying the  rules in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. On the other hand, in  the case of an employee who does not receive any distribution under  these plans before October 20, 1960, the determination as to whether  distributions to him are received under a single contract or under more  than one contract shall be made in accordance with the rules illustrated  by this example.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1961, Z Corporation established a profit- sharing plan for its employees providing that any employee may make  contributions, not in excess of 6 percent of his compensation, to a  trust and that   the employer would make matching contributions out of profits. Under the  plan, a participant may receive a periodic distribution of the amount  standing in his account during any period that he is absent from work  due to a personal injury or sickness. On separation from service, the  participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the balance  standing in his account in accordance with one of several options. One  option provides for the immediate distribution of one-half of the  account and for the periodic distribution of the remaining one-half of  the account. In addition, any participant may, after the completion of  five years of participation, withdraw any part of his account, but in  the case of such a withdrawal, the participant forfeits his rights to  participate in the plan for a period of two years. Thus, a participant  may receive distributions before separation from service; he may receive  a distribution of a lump sum upon separation from service; he may also  receive periodic distributions upon separation from service. However,  since it is the total amount received under all the options that is  interrelated with the contributions to the plan and not the amount  received under any one option, this profit-sharing plan consists of only  one separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and all  distributions under the plan (regardless of the option under which  received) are treated as received under one contract. However, if,  instead of providing that the amount standing in an employee's account  would be paid to him during any period that he is absent from work due  to a personal injury or sickness, the plan provided that a portion of  the amount in the employee's account would be used to purchase  incidental accident and health insurance, this plan would consist of two  separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits. The  accident and health insurance, and the contributions used to purchase  it, would be considered as one separate program of interrelated  contributions and benefits and, therefore, a separate contract; whereas,  the remaining contributions and benefits would be considered another  separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and,  consequently, another separate contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On January 1, 1961, N Corporation established a profit- sharing plan for its employees providing that the employees may make  contributions, not in excess of 6 percent of their compensation, to a  trust and that N Corporation would make matching contributions out of  its profits. Under the plan, the employee may elect each year to have  his and the employer's contributions for such year placed in either a  savings arrangement or a retirement arrangement. Such an election is  irrevocable. Under the savings arrangement, contributions to such  arrangement for any one year and the earnings thereon will be  distributed five years later. The retirement arrangement provides that  all contributions thereto and the earnings thereon will be distributed  when the employee is separated from the service of N Corporation. Since  the distributions under the retirement arrangement are attributable  solely to the contributions made to such arrangement and are not  affected in any manner by contributions or distributions under the  savings arrangement or any other plan, such distributions are treated as  received under a separate program of interrelated contributions and  benefits. Similarly, since distributions during any year under the  savings arrangement are attributable only to contributions to such  arrangement made during the fifth preceding year and are not affected in  any manner by any other contributions to or distributions from such  arrangement or any other plan, the savings arrangement constitutes a  series of separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits.  The contributions to the savings arrangement for any year and the  distribution in a subsequent year based thereon constitute a separate  contract for purposes of section 72.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The Civil Service Retirement Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 14) which  provides retirement benefits for participating employees, consists of a  compulsory program and a voluntary program. Under the compulsory  program, all participating employees are required to make certain  contributions and, upon retirement, are provided retirement benefits  computed on the basis of compensation and length of service. Under the  voluntary program, such participating employees are permitted to make  contributions in addition to those required under the compulsory program  and, upon retirement, are provided additional retirement benefits  computed on the basis of their voluntary contributions. Distributions  received under the Act constitute distributions from two separate  contracts for purposes of section 72. Distributions received under the  compulsory program are considered as received under a separate program  of interrelated contributions and benefits since they are computed  solely under the compulsory program and are not affected by any  contributions or distributions under the voluntary program or under any  other plan. For similar reasons, distributions which are attributable to  the voluntary contributions are considered as received under a separate  program of interrelated contributions and benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On January 1, 1961, M Corporation established a  contributory pension plan for its employees and created a trust to which  it makes contributions to fund such plan. The plan provides that each  participant will receive after age 65 a pension of 1\1/2\ percent of his  compensation for each year of   service performed subsequent to the establishment of such plan. In order  to fund part of the benefits under the plan, the trustee purchased a  group annuity contract. The remaining part of the benefits are to be  paid out of a separate investment fund. This pension plan constitutes a  single program of interrelated contributions and benefits and,  therefore, all distributions received by an employee under the plan are  considered as received under a single contract for purposes of section  72.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On January 1, 1961, Y Corporation established a  noncontributory pension plan (including incidental death benefits) for  its employees and created a trust to which it makes contributions to  fund such plan. The plan provides that each participant will receive  after age 65 a pension of 1\1/2\ percent of his compensation for each  year of service performed subsequent to the establishment of such plan.  In addition, such plan provides for the payment of a death benefit if  the employee dies before age 65. The trustee funded the death benefits  through the purchase of a group term insurance policy and funded the  retirement benefits through the purchase of a group annuity contract.  Because of a subsequent change in funding from the deferred annuity  method to the deposit administration method, the trustee purchased a  second group annuity contract to provide the retirement benefits under  the plan accruing after the effective date of the change in method of  funding. Thus, retirement benefits distributed to an employee whose  service with Y Corporation commenced before the effective date of the  change in method of funding will be attributable to both group annuity  contracts. This pension plan includes two separate programs of  interrelated contributions and benefits. The death benefits, and the  contributions required to provide them, are considered as one separate  program of interrelated contributions and benefits; whereas, the  retirement benefits, and the contributions required to provide them, are  considered as another separate program of interrelated contributions and  benefits. Therefore, any retirement benefits received by an employee,  whether attributable to one or both of the group annuity contracts,  shall be considered as received under a single contract for purposes of  section 72. In determining the tax treatment of any such retirement  benefits under section 72, no amount of the premiums used to purchase  the group term insurance policy shall be taken into account, since such  premiums, and the death benefits which they purchased, constitute a  separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in example (6) except that, in  lieu of funding the benefits in the manner described in that example,  the trustee purchased individual retirement income contracts from an  insurance company. Additional individual retirement income contracts are  purchased in order to fund any increase in benefits resulting from  increases in salary. Therefore, distributions to a particular employee  may be attributable to a single retirement income contract or to more  than one such contract. All distributions received by an employee under  the pension plan, whether attributable to one or more retirement income  contracts and whether made directly from the insurance company to the  employee or made through the trustee, are considered as received under a  single contract for purposes of section 72. For rules relating to the  tax treatment of contributions and distributions under retirement  income, endowment, or other life insurance contracts purchased by a  trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a), see  paragraph (a) (2), (3), and (4) of Sec. 1.402(a)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in example (6) except that, in  lieu of funding the benefits in the manner described in that example,  the trustee funded the death benefits and part of the retirement  benefits by purchasing individual retirement income contracts from an  insurance company. The remaining part of the retirement benefits (such  as any increase in benefits resulting from increases in salary) are to  be paid out of a separate investment fund. This pension plan includes,  with respect to each participant, two separate contracts for purposes of  section 72. The retirement income contract purchased by the trust for  each participant is a separate program of interrelated contributions and  benefits and all distributions attributable to such contract (whether  made directly from the insurance company to the employee or made through  the trustee) are considered as received under a single contract. For  rules relating to the tax treatment of contributions and distributions  under retirement income, endowment, or other life insurance contracts  purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under  section 501(a), see paragraph (a) (2), (3), and (4) of Sec. 1.402(a)-1.  The remaining distributions under the plan are considered as received  under another separate program of interrelated contributions and  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general, the amounts to which section 72  applies are any amounts received under the contracts described in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, if such amounts are  specifically excluded from gross income under other provisions of  Chapter 1 of the Code, section 72 shall not apply for the purpose of  including such amounts in gross income. For example, section 72 does not  apply to amounts   received under a life insurance contract if such amounts are paid by  reason of the death of the insured and are excludable from gross income  under section 101(a). See also sections 101(d), relating to proceeds of  life insurance paid at a date later than death, and 104(a)(4), relating  to compensation for injuries or sickness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 72 does not exclude from gross income any amounts  received under an agreement to hold an amount and pay interest thereon.  See paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.72-14. However, section 72 does apply to  amounts received by a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor  annuity contract since such amounts are not considered to be paid by  reason of the death of an insured. For a special deduction for the  estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the interest of  a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract in the  estate of the deceased primary annuitant, see section 691(d) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts subject to section 72 in accordance with subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph are considered ``amounts received as an annuity''  only in the event that all of the following tests are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> They must be received on or after the ``annuity starting date''  as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-4;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> They must be payable in periodic installments at regular  intervals (whether annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, weekly,  or otherwise) over a period of more than one full year from the annuity  starting date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this subparagraph are met with respect to the payments  determinable at the outset by means of computations involving the fixed  interest rate, but any payments received after the expiration of the  period determinable by such computations shall be taxable as dividends  received after the annuity starting date in accordance with paragraph  (b)(2) of Sec. 1.72-11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding the requirement of subparagraph (2)(iii) of  this paragraph, if amounts are to be received for a definite or  determinable time (whether for a period certain or for a life or lives)  under a contract which provides:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> That the amount of the periodic payments may vary in accordance  with investment experience (as in certain profit-sharing plans), cost of  living indices, or similar fluctuating criteria, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> of Sec. 1.72-11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the  number of periodic payments anticipated during the time payments are to  be made shall be determined by multiplying the number of payments to be  made each year (a) by the number of years payments are to be made, or  (b) if payments are to be made for a life or lives, by the multiple  found by the use of the appropriate tables contained in Sec. 1.72-9, as  adjusted in accordance with the table in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.72- 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For an example of the computation to be made in accordance  with this subparagraph and a special election which may be made in a  taxable year subsequent to a taxable year in which the total payments  received under a contract described in this subparagraph are less than  the total of the amounts excludable from gross income in such year under  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, see paragraph (d)(3) of Sec.  1.72-4.
