                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant

with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four identified elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under Sec. 89.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An estimate of the program's duration, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The technical nature of the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The site of the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time or mileage duration of the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The intended final disposition of the engines;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the record-keeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.
