                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Background. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A variety of plant and animal species of the  United States are so reduced in numbers that they are threatened with  extinction. The disappearance of any of these would be a biological,  cultural, and in some instances an economic loss. Their existence  contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding, and their  presence adds interest and variety to life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The principal hazard to threatened and endangered species is the  destruction or deterioration of their habitats by human activities such  as industrialization, urbanization, agriculture, lumbering, recreation,  and transportation. These activities of man will continue but the  necessity of recognizing their adverse impacts and selecting  alternatives that minimize or eliminate such impacts on threatened and  endangered species is imperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884  (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)) provides a means whereby the ecosystems upon  which endangered and threatened species depend may be maintained and a  program for the conservation of such species. The Act also provides  that, in addition to the Department of the Interior, ``All other federal  departments and agencies shall, in consultation with and with the  assistance of the Secretary (of Interior), utilize their authorities for  the conservation of endangered species and threatened species listed  pursuant to section 4 of this Act and by taking such action necessary to  insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not  jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species and  threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of  habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after  consultation as appropriate with the affected states, to be critical.''  The Act also:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Defines endangered species as any species in danger of  extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and  threatened species as any species likely to become an endangered species  within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of  its range. The Act uses the category ``threatened.'' The term ``rare''  is not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Further defines species as including any subspecies of fish or  wildlife or plants and any other group of fish and   wildlife of the same species or smaller taxa in common spatial  arrangements that interbreed when mature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provides for the Secretary of the Interior to enter into  cooperative agreements with states for the purpose of implementing state  programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened fish and  wildlife. This assistance may include financial grants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provides national lists of endangered and threatened animal and  plant species to be maintained by the Secretary of the Interior and  published in the Federal Register. When resident fish and wildlife are  added to the list, the affected states are to be consulted by the  Secretary. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is preparing a  list of endangered or threatened plant species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Policy. The Act gives NRCS additional direction for  participation in the conservation and protection of endangered and  threatened species. As the principal federal agency concerned with land  use planning of privately owned rural land and with professional  conservation employees headquartered in almost every county, NRCS is  uniquely capable of playing a vital role. Additional training will be  provided as needed to meet NRCS responsibilities. NRCS will assist in  the conservation of threatened and endangered species and consistent  with legal requirements avoid or prevent activities detrimental to such  species. NRCS concern for these species will not be limited to those  listed by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the Federal  Register, but will include species designated by state agencies as rare,  threatened, endangered, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NRCS national office. The Administrator will  arrange for consultation and coordination of NRCS national office  activities with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal  agencies, and national organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Technical service center. The TSC director will, within the  group of states served by the TSC arrange for consultation and  coordination with regional representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, other Federal agencies, and national and regional  organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NRCS state office. The state conservationist will arrange for  consultation and coordination with the state fish and game or  conservation agency, other state agencies, state organizations and  foundations, conservation districts, and state representatives of  federal agencies and national organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Coordination and implementation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The NRCS national office  will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within the framework of national legislation, USDA agreements,  and NRCS objectives, develop NRCS policies and directives for guiding  agency efforts that will protect threatened and endangered species and  for avoiding actions that jeopardize the continued existence of such  species and their critical habitats.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maintain needed liaison and develop mutual understanding with  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other concerned federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Establish procedures for periodic review of NRCS participation  in the national effort to conserve these species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The TSC director will: (i) Within the framework of NRCS policies  and guidelines, arrange for needed liaison and understanding with  regional counterparts of other federal agencies within the group of  states served by the TSC and keep state conservationists informed of  developments within such states.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide guidance and assistance to state conservationists in  carrying out NRCS policies and guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The state conservationist will develop procedures to establish  working relationships with other concerned federal agencies, state fish  and wildlife or conservation agencies, conservation districts, concerned  scientists in state university systems and natural history museums, and  other informed persons and organizations to offer assistance in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preparing or maintaining lists of the state's threatened and  endangered species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining the geographic occurrence of endangered and  threatened species, the nature of their habitat, and that portion of the  habitat that is critical to the survival, maintenance, or increase of  these species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Discussing the kinds of measures important to preserve their  habitat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A monitoring program that would obtain advanced warning of  actions or conditions that could further endanger these species, thereby  enabling NRCS and others to take appropriate protective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assisting recovery teams, as appropriate, in preparing species  recovery plans of those endangered and threatened species included in  Federal lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The state conservationist will also:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Keep NRCS area and field offices informed of species listed as  being threatened or endangered, geographic area in which they are found,  and information such as their numbers, preferred habitat, and critical  factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review the status of threatened and endangered species each  December and send a report of the review to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> NRCS district conservationists within the geographic range of  threatened and endangered species will examine conservation district  programs and NRCS operations to evaluate their effects on these species,  and recommend to district officials and the state conservationist any  action needed for their protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> NRCS field employees within the geographic range of threatened  and endangered species will be continually alert to conditions, actions,  or trends that may adversely affect the welfare of these species and  report adverse situations to the state conservationist.</p>
