The reviewer must be a qualified engineer not involved in the original design of the dam or a Federal or State agency responsible for dam safety. The reviewer must be approved by RUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The independent review of design must include, but not necessarily be limited to, plans, specifications, design calculations, subsurface investigation reports, hydrology reports, and redesigns which result from encountering unanticipated or unusual conditions during construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The independent review of construction shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foundation preparation and treatment. When the foundation has been excavated and exposed, and before critical structures such as earth embankments or concrete structures are placed thereon, the borrower shall require the reviewer to conduct an independent examination of the foundation to ensure that suitable foundation material has been reached and that the measures proposed for treatment of the foundation are adequate. This examination must extend to the preparation and treatment of the foundation for the abutments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fill placement. During initial placement of compacted fill materials, the borrower shall require the reviewer to conduct an independent examination to ensure that the materials being used in the various zones are suitable and that the placement and compaction procedures being used by the contractor will result in a properly constructed embankment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the reviewer disagrees with any aspect of the design or construction which could affect the safety of the dam, then the borrower must meet with the design engineer and the reviewer to resolve the disagreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Emergency action plan. For high hazard potential dams, the borrower must develop an emergency action plan incorporating preplanned emergency measures to be taken prior to and following a potential dam failure. The plan should be coordinated with local government and other authorities involved with the public safety and be approved by the borrower's board of directors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> For more information and guidance, the following publications regarding dam safety are available from FEMA:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For more information and guidance, the following publications regarding dam safety are available from FEMA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>``Emergency Action Planning Guidelines for Dams,''FEMA 64.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>``Federal Guidelines for Earthquake Analysis and Design of Dams,''FEMA 65.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>``Federal Guidelines for Selecting and Accommodating Inflow Design Floods for Dams,''FEMA 94.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>``Dam Safety: An Owner's Guidance Manual,''FEMA 145, August, 1987.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These publications may be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mitigation Directorate, PO Box 2012, Jessup, MD 20794.
