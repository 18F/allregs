                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 1507.3(b)(2), in conjunction with Sec. 1508.4, requires agencies to identify typical classes of action that warrant similar treatment under NEPA with respect to the preparation of EIS's or environmental assessments. As a general matter, the Commission's activities do not include actions for which EIS's or environmental assessments are required. Its activities involve:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consultation with and recommendations to other Federal agencies for actions relating to marine mammal protection and conservation for which an EIS or environmental assessment is either not required by the NEPA regulations or for which an EIS or environmental assessment is prepared by another Federal agency; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Research contracts relating to policy issues, biological-ecological data needed to make sound management decisions, and better methods for collecting and analyzing data. These activities are not, by themselves, major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and the Commission's activities are therefore categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or environmental assessment except for proposals for legislation which are initiated by the Commission, for which the Commission shall develop environmental assessments or EIS's, as appropriate, in accordance with the NEPA regulations. The Commission shall independently determine whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action above; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.</p>
