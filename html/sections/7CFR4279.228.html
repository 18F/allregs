                            <p class="depth0">In lieu of the requirements specified in Sec. 4279.113, to be  eligible for a guaranteed loan under this subpart, at a minimum, a  borrower and project, as applicable, must meet each of the requirements  specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The project must be located in a State, as defined in Sec.  4279.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The project must be for either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The development and construction of commercial-scale  biorefineries using eligible technology or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The retrofitting of existing facilities, including, but not  limited to, wood products facilities and sugar mills, with eligible  technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The project must use an eligible feedstock for the production of  advanced biofuels and biobased products. Eligible feedstocks include,  but are not limited to, renewable biomass, including municipal solid  waste consisting of renewable biomass, biosolids, treated sewage sludge,  and byproducts of the pulp and paper industry. For the purposes of this  subpart, recycled paper is not an eligible feedstock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The majority of the biorefinery production must be an advanced  biofuel. Unless otherwise approved by the Agency, and determined to be  in the best financial interest of the government, the advanced biofuel  must be sold as a biofuel. The following will be considered in  determining what constitutes the majority of production:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the biorefinery produces a biobased product and, if  applicable, byproduct that has an established BTU content from a  recognized Federal source, majority biofuel production   will be based on BTU content of the advanced biofuel, the biobased  product, and, if applicable, the byproduct, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the biorefinery produces a biobased product or, if  applicable, byproduct that does not have an established BTU content,  then majority biofuel production will be based on output volume, using  parameters announced by the Agency in periodic Notices in the Federal  Register, of the advanced biofuel, the biobased product, and, if  applicable, the byproduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An advanced biofuel that is converted to another form of energy  for sale will still be considered an advanced biofuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The project must provide funds (e.g., cash, subordinate  financing, non-federal grant) of not less than 20 percent of eligible  project costs. All projects must meet the equity requirements specified  in Sec. 4279.234(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permanent financing used to refinance interim construction  financing of the proposed project only if the application for the  guaranteed loan under this subpart was approved prior to closing the  interim loan for the construction of the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refinancing that is no more than 20 percent of the loan for  which the Agency is guaranteeing and the purpose of the refinance is to  enable the Agency to establish a first lien position with respect to  pre-existing collateral subject to a pre-existing lien and the  refinancing would be in the best financial interests of the Federal  Government.</p>
