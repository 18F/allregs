                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. (1) The color additive FD&C; Yellow No. 6 is principally the disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (CAS Reg. No. 2783-94-0). The trisodium salt of 3-hydroxy-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid (CAS Reg. No. 50880-65-4) may be added in small amounts. The color additive is manufactured by diazotizing 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid using hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite or sulfuric acid and sodium nitrite. The diazo compound is coupled with 6-hydroxy-2-naphthalene-sulfonic acid. The dye is isolated as the sodium salt and dried. The trisodium salt of 3-hydroxy-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid which may be blended with the principal color is prepared in the same manner except the diazo benzenesulfonic acid is coupled with 3-hydroxy-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive FD&C; Yellow No. 6 is principally the disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (CAS Reg.

The color additive FD&C; Yellow No. 6 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by current good manufacturing practice:

The color additive FD&C; Yellow No. 6 may be safely used for coloring foods (including dietary supplements) generally in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice, except that it may not be used to color foods for which standards of identity have been promulgated under section 401 of the act unless added color is authorized by such standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling requirements. (1) The label of the color additive and any mixtures intended solely or in part for coloring purposes prepared therefrom shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label of the color additive and any mixtures intended solely or in part for coloring purposes prepared therefrom shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification. All batches of FD&C; Yellow No. 6 shall be certified in accordance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
