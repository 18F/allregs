                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to  comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a  Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award,  the contracting officer may, in addition to imposing any of the special  conditions outlined in Sec. 600.304, take one or more of the following  actions, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the  deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the  contracting officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disallow (that is, deny both the use of funds and any applicable  matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action  not in compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withhold further awards for the project or program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Apply other remedies that may be legally available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, DOE must  provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other  administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any  statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of suspension and termination. Costs resulting from  obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after  termination of an award are not allowable, unless the contracting  officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or  termination or subsequently authorizes such costs. Other recipient costs  during suspension or after termination, which are necessary and not  reasonably avoidable, are allowable if the costs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the  recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are  not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are  noncancellable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would be allowable if the award expired normally at the end of  the funding period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement  remedies identified in this section, including suspension and  termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment  and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.</p>
