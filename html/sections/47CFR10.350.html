                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies the testing that will be required, no later  than the date of deployment of the WEA, of WEA components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required monthly tests. Testing of the WEA from the Federal  Alert Gateway to each Participating CMS Provider's infrastructure shall  be conducted monthly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Participating CMS Provider's Gateway shall support the ability  to receive a required monthly test (RMT) message initiated by the  Federal Alert Gateway Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participating CMS Providers shall schedule the distribution of  the RMT to their WEA coverage area over a 24 hour period commencing upon  receipt of the RMT at the CMS Provider Gateway. Participating CMS  Providers shall determine the method to distribute the RMTs, and may  schedule over the 24 hour period the delivery of RMTs over geographic  subsets of their coverage area to manage traffic loads and to  accommodate maintenance windows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Participating CMS Provider may forego an RMT if the RMT is  pre-empted by actual alert traffic or if an unforeseen condition in the  CMS Provider infrastructure precludes distribution of the RMT. A  Participating CMS Provider Gateway shall indicate such an unforeseen  condition by a response code to the Federal Alert Gateway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The RMT shall be initiated only by the Federal Alert Gateway  Administrator using a defined test message. Real event codes or alert  messages shall not be used for the WEA RMT message.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A Participating CMS Provider shall distribute an RMT within its   WEA coverage area within 24 hours of receipt by the CMS Provider Gateway  unless pre-empted by actual alert traffic or unable due to an unforeseen  condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A Participating CMS Provider may provide mobile devices with the  capability of receiving RMT messages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A Participating CMS Provider must retain an automated log of RMT  messages received by the CMS Provider Gateway from the Federal Alert  Gateway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periodic C interface testing. In addition to the required  monthly tests, a Participating CMS Provider must participate in periodic  testing of the interface between the Federal Alert Gateway and its CMS  Provider Gateway. This periodic interface testing is not intended to  test the CMS Provider's infrastructure nor the mobile devices but rather  is required to ensure the availability/viability of both gateway  functions. Each CMS Provider Gateway shall send an acknowledgement to  the Federal Alert Gateway upon receipt of such an interface test  message. Real event codes or alert messages shall not be used for this  periodic interface testing.  [73 FR 47558, Aug. 14, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16808, Mar. 19, 2013]</p>
