Prior to its initial use and monthly thereafter, or within one month prior to the certification test, calibrate the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either purified synthetic air or zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each used operating range with carbon monoxide-in-N2 calibration gases having nominal concentrations between 10 and 90 percent of that range. A minimum of six evenly spaced points covering at least 80 percent of the 10 to 90 range (64 percent) is required (see following table).

Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, calculate concentration values by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, use the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent of each test point to determine concentration.</p>
