You can do that yourself or through a testing lab.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To determine the automotive fuel rating of gasoline, add the  research octane number and the motor octane number and divide by two, as  explained by ASTM D4814-10b, ``Standard Specifications for Automotive  Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel,'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  306.0(b)(2)). To determine the research octane and motor octane numbers  you may either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use ASTM standard test method ASTM D2699-09, ``Standard Test  Method for Research Octane Number of Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel''  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 306.0(b)(2)), to determine the  research octane number, and ASTM standard test method ASTM D2700-09,  ``Standard Test Method for Motor Octane Number of Spark-Ignition Engine  Fuel'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 306.0(b)(2)), to determine  the motor octane number; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine automotive fuel ratings for alternative liquid  automotive fuels other than biodiesel blends and biomass-based diesel  blends, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and  reliable evidence, for the percentage by volume of the principal  component of the alternative liquid automotive fuel that you must  disclose. In the case of biodiesel blends, you must possess a reasonable  basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage  of biodiesel contained in the fuel, and in the case of biomass-based  diesel blends, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of  competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage of biomass-based  diesel contained in the fuel. You also must have a reasonable basis,  consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the minimum  percentages by volume of other components that you choose to disclose.
