                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No State savings association may, without application to and approval by the FDIC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Combine with any insured depository institution, if the acquiring or resulting institution is to be a State savings association; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assume liability to pay any deposit made in, any insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> No State savings association may, without notifying the FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No State savings association may, without notifying the FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combine with another insured depository institution where a State savings association is not the resulting institution; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a State savings association that meets the conditions for expedited treatment under Sec. 390.101, convert, directly or indirectly, to a national or state bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State savings association that does not meet the conditions for expedited treatment under Sec. 390.101 may not, directly or indirectly, convert to a national or state bank without prior application to and approval of FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No State savings association may make any transfer (excluding transfers subject to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section) without notice or application to the FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``transfer'' means purchases or sales of assets or liabilities in bulk not made in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, transfers of assets or savings account liabilities, purchases of assets, and assumptions of deposit accounts or other liabilities, and combinations with a depository institution other than an insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section, the FDIC shall take into account the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section, the FDIC shall take into account the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The capital level of any resulting State savings association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The financial and managerial resources of the constituent institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The future prospects of the constituent institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The convenience and needs of the communities to be served;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Factors relating to the fairness of and disclosure concerning the transaction, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Equitable treatment. The transaction should be equitable to all concerned--savings account holders, borrowers, creditors and stockholders (if any) of each State savings association--giving proper recognition of and protection to their respective legal rights and interests. The transaction will be closely reviewed for fairness where the transaction does not appear to be the result of arms' length bargaining or, in the case of a stock State savings association, where controlling stockholders are receiving different consideration from other stockholders. No finder's or similar fee should be

paid to any officer, director, or controlling person of a State savings association which is a party to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Full disclosure. The filing should make full disclosure of all written or oral agreements or understandings by which any person or company will receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property, service, release of pledges made, or other thing of value, whether tangible or intangible, in connection with the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Compensation to officers. Compensation, including deferred compensation, to officers, directors and controlling persons of the disappearing State savings association by the resulting institution or an affiliate thereof should not be in excess of a reasonable amount, and should be commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The filing should fully justify the compensation to be paid to such persons. The transaction will be particularly scrutinized where any of such persons is to receive a material increase in compensation above that paid by the disappearing State savings association prior to the commencement of negotiations regarding the proposed transaction. An increase in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or $10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control. In the case of such an increase, evidence sufficient to rebut such presumptions should be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Advisory boards. Advisory board members should be elected for a term not exceeding one year. No advisory board fees should be paid to salaried officers or employees of the resulting State savings association. The filing should describe and justify the duties and responsibilities and any compensation paid to any advisory board of the resulting State savings association that consists of officers, directors or controlling persons of the disappearing institution, particularly if the disappearing institution experienced significant supervisory problems prior to the transaction. No advisory board fees should exceed the director fees paid by the resulting State savings association. Advisory board fees that are in excess of 115 percent of the director fees paid by the disappearing State savings association prior to commencement of negotiations regarding the transaction give rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control unless sufficient evidence to rebut such presumptions is submitted. Rebuttal evidence is not required if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The advisory board fees do not exceed the fee that advisory board members of the resulting institution receive for each monthly meeting attended or $150, whichever is greater; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The advisory board fees do not exceed $100 per meeting attended for disappearing State savings associations with assets greater than $10,000,000 or $50 per meeting attended for disappearing State savings associations with assets of $10,000,000 or less, based on a schedule of 12 meetings per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The accounting and tax treatment of the transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Fees paid and professional services rendered in connection with the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In conferring approval of a transaction under paragraph (a) of this section, the FDIC also will consider the competitive impact of the transaction, including whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transaction would result in a monopoly, or would be in furtherance of any monopoly or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the State savings association business in any part of the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of the transaction on any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the FDIC finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applications and notices filed under this section shall be upon forms prescribed by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applications filed under paragraph (a) of this section must be processed in accordance with the time frames set forth in Sec. Sec. 390.127 through 390.135, provided that the period for review may be extended only if the FDIC determines that the applicant has

failed to furnish all requested information or that the information submitted is substantially inaccurate, in which case the review period may be extended for up to 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> The following procedures apply to applications described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the FDIC finds that it must act immediately to prevent the probable default of one of the depository institutions involved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following procedures apply to applications described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the FDIC finds that it must act immediately to prevent the probable default of one of the depository institutions involved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant must publish a public notice of the application in accordance with the procedures in Sec.

Sec. 390.116 through 390.120. The public comment period is 30 calendar days after the date of publication of the initial public notice. However, if the FDIC has advised the Attorney General that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action, the public comment period is 10 calendar days after the date of publication of the initial public notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The FDIC may arrange a meeting in accordance with the procedures in Sec. Sec. 390.121 through 390.125.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The FDIC will request the Attorney General, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to provide reports on the competitive impacts involved in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The FDIC will immediately notify the Attorney General of the approval of the transaction. The applicant may not consummate the transaction before the date established under 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For applications described in Sec. 390.332, certain State savings associations described below must provide affected accountholders with a notice of a proposed account transfer and an option of retaining the account in the transferring State savings association. The notice must allow affected accountholders at least 30 days to consider whether to retain their accounts in the transferring State savings association. The following State savings associations must provide the notices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A State savings association transferring account liabilities to an institution the accounts of which are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any mutual State savings association transferring account liabilities to a stock form depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Automatic approvals by the FDIC.
