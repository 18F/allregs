                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before engaging in outside employment with or without  compensation, an employee of the Office of Management and Budget, other  than a special Government employee, must obtain the written approval of  his or her division or office head, the General Counsel, and the  Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO). Requests for approval shall be  forwarded through normal supervisory channels to the division or office  head, who shall forward the request to the General Counsel, to be  forwarded with their successive approvals to the DAEO. The request for  approval shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the name of the person, group, or other  organization for whom the work is to be performed; the type of work to  be performed; and the proposed hours of work and approximate dates of  employment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the outside employment will not depend on  information obtained as a result of the employee's official Government  position and that no official duty time or Government property,  resources, or facilities not available to the general public will be  used in connection with the outside employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the  outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by  statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, ``employment'' means any form of  non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision  of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited  to, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent,  attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher or  speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another  person for production or publication of the written product. It does  not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit  charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational,  recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such  activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or  are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.
