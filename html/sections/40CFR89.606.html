                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether an ICI's production nonroad engines comply with applicable emission requirements or requirements of this subpart, an EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative is authorized to conduct inspections and/or tests of nonroad engines imported by the ICI. The ICI must admit an EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative during operating hours to any of the following places upon demand and upon presentation of credentials:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any facility where any nonroad engine imported by the ICI under this subpart was or is being modified, tested, or stored and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any facility where any record or other document relating to modification, testing, or storage of the nonroad engine, or required to be kept by Sec. 89.607, is located. EPA may require inspection or testing of nonroad engines at the test facility used by the ICI or at an EPA-designated testing facility, with transportation and/or testing costs to be borne by the ICI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, an EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative is allowed during operating hours:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of activities relating to the ICI's modification, testing, and/or storage of nonroad engines imported under this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To inspect and make copies of record(s) or document(s) related to modification, testing, and storage of a nonroad engine, or required by Sec. 89.607; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of the nonroad engine and any component used in the assembly thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative is to be furnished, by those in charge of a facility being inspected, with such reasonable assistance as the officer or representative may request to help discharge any function listed in this subpart. An ICI must make arrangements with those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA. Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, and the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer any questions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply whether or not the ICI owns or controls the facility in question. It is the ICI's responsibility to make such arrangements as may be necessary to assure compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Failure to do so, or other failure to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c), may result in sanctions as provided for in the Act or Sec. 89.612(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duly designated enforcement officers are authorized to proceed ex parte to seek warrants authorizing the inspection or testing of the nonroad engines described in paragraph (a) of this section whether or not the enforcement officers first attempted to seek permission from the ICI or facility owner to inspect such nonroad engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The results of the Administrator's test under this section comprise the official test data for the nonroad engine for purposes of determining whether the nonroad engine should be permitted final entry under Sec. 89.605 or Sec. 89.609.
