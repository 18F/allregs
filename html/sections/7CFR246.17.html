                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. State agencies shall submit preliminary and final  closeout reports for each fiscal year. All obligations shall be  liquidated before closure of a fiscal year grant. Obligations shall be  reported for the fiscal year in which they occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fiscal year closeout reports. State agencies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall submit to FNS, within 30 days after the end of the fiscal  year, preliminary financial reports which show cumulative actual  expenditures and obligations for the fiscal year, or part thereof, for  which Program funds were made available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall submit to FNS, within 120 days after the end of the fiscal  year, final fiscal year closeout reports;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May submit revised closeout reports. FNS will reimburse State  agencies for additional costs claimed in a revised closeout report up to  the State's original grant level, if costs are properly justified and if  funds are available for the fiscal year pertaining to the request. FNS  will not be responsible for reimbursing State agencies for unreported  expenditures later than one year after the end of the fiscal year in  which they were incurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grant closeout procedures. When grants to State agencies are  terminated, the following procedures shall be performed in accordance  with 7 CFR part 3016.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may disqualify a State agency's participation under the  Program, in whole or in part, or take such remedies as may be legal and  appropriate, whenever FNS determines that the State agency failed to  comply with the conditions prescribed in this part, in its Federal-State  Agreement, or in FNS guidelines and instructions. FNS will promptly  notify the State agency in writing of the disqualification together with  the effective date. A State agency shall disqualify a local agency by  written notice whenever it is determined by FNS or the State agency that  the local agency has failed to comply with the requirements of the  Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FNS or the State agency may disqualify the State agency or  restrict its participation in the Program when both parties agree that  continuation under the Program would not produce beneficial results  commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. The State agency or  the local agency may disqualify the local agency or restrict its  participation in the Program under the same conditions. The two parties  shall agree upon the conditions of disqualification, including the  effective date thereof, and, in the case of partial disqualification,  the portion to be disqualified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon termination of a grant, the affected agency shall not incur  new obligations for the disqualified portion after the effective date,  and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. FNS will  allow full credit to the State agency for the Federal share of the  noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the State agency prior  to disqualification, and the State agency shall do the same for the  local agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A grant closeout shall not affect the retention period for, or  Federal rights of access to, grant records as specified in Sec. 246.25.  The closeout of a grant does not affect the State or local agency's  responsibilities regarding property or with respect to any Program  income for which the State or local agency is still accountable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A final audit is not a required part of the grant closeout and  should not be needed unless there are problems with   the grant that require attention. If FNS considers a final audit to be  necessary, it shall so inform OIG. OIG will be resonsible for ensuring  that necessary final audits are performed and for any necessary  coordination with other Federal cognizant audit agencies or the State or  local auditors. Audits performed in accordance with Sec. 246.20 may  serve as final audits providing such audits meet the needs of requesting  agencies. If the grant is closed out without the audit, FNS reserves the  right to disallow and recover an appropriate amount after fully  considering any recommended disallowances resulting from an audit which  may be conducted later.
