                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When. Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent shall  file an answer as designated in the notice. In a civil money penalty  proceeding, respondent shall also file a request for a hearing within 20  days of service of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of answer. An answer must specifically respond to each  paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the   notice and must admit, deny, or state that the party lacks sufficient  information to admit or deny each allegation of fact. A statement of  lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet  the substance of each allegation of fact denied; general denials are not  permitted. When a respondent denies part of an allegation, that part  must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation  of fact in the notice which is not denied in the answer must be deemed  admitted for purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to  respond to the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for  relief or proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative  defenses, if any, asserted by the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Default--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effect of failure to answer. Failure of a  respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time  provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest  the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, Enforcement  Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a  finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a  timely answer, the administrative law judge shall file with the Board of  Directors a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief  sought in the notice. Any final order issued by the Board of Directors  based upon a respondent's failure to answer is deemed to be an order  issued upon consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of failure to request a hearing in civil money penalty  proceedings. If respondent fails to request a hearing as required by law  within the time provided, the notice of assessment constitutes a final  and unappealable order.</p>
