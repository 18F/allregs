                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substances subject to these regulations. Only chemical  substances which are manufactured, imported, or processed ``for a  commercial purpose,'' as defined in Sec. 710.3(d), are subject to these  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Naturally occurring chemical substances automatically included.  Any chemical substance which is naturally occurring and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Which is (i) unprocessed or (ii) processed only by manual,  mechanical, or gravitational means; by dissolution in water; by  flotation; or by heating solely to remove water; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Which is extracted from air by any means, will automatically be  included in the inventory under the category ``Naturally Occurring  Chemical Substances.'' Examples of such substances are: raw agricultural  commodities; water, air, natural gas, and crude oil; and rocks, ores,  and minerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Substances excluded by definition or section 8(b) of TSCA. The  following substances are excluded from the inventory:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any substance which is not considered a ``chemical substance''  as provided in subsection 3(2)(B) of the Act and in the definition of  ``chemical substance'' in Sec. 710.3(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any mixture as defined in Sec. 710.3(d);</p><p class="depth0">Note: A chemical substance that is manufactured as part of a mixture  is subject to these reporting regulations. This exclusion applies only  to the mixture and not to the chemical substances of which the mixture  is comprised. The term ``mixture'' includes alloys, inorganic glasses,  ceramics, frits, and cements, including Portland cement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any chemical substance which is manufactured, imported, or  processed solely in small quantities for research and development, as  defined in Sec. 710.3(d); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any chemical substance not manufactured, processed or imported  for a commercial purpose since January 1, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Chemical substances excluded from the inventory. The following  chemical substances are excluded from the inventory. Although they are  considered to be manufactured or processed for a commercial purpose for  the purpose of section 8 of the Act, they are not manufactured or  processed for distribution in commerce as chemical substances per se and  have no commercial purpose separate from the substance, mixture, or  article of which they may be a part.</p><p class="depth0">Note: In addition, chemical substances excluded here will not be  subject to premanufacture notification under section 5 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any impurity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any byproduct which has no commercial purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A byproduct which has commercial value only to municipal or  private organizations who (i) burn it as a fuel, (ii) dispose of it as a  waste, including in a landfill or for enriching soil, or (iii) extract  component chemical substances which have commercial value, may be  reported for the inventory, but will not be subject to premanufacture  notification under section 5 of the Act if not included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction  that occurs incidental to exposure of another chemical substance,  mixture, or article to environmental factors such as air, moisture,  microbial organisms, or sunlight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction  that occurs incidental to storage of another chemical substance,  mixture, or article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction  that occurs upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or  articles such as adhesives, paints, miscellaneous cleansers or other  housekeeping products, fuels and fuel additives, water softening and  treatment agents, photographic films, batteries, matches, and safety  flares, and which is not itself manufactured for distribution in  commerce or for use as an intermediate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction  that occurs upon use of curable plastic or rubber molding compounds,  inks, drying oils, metal finishing compounds, adhesives, or paints; or  other chemical substances formed during manufacture of an article  destined for the marketplace without further chemical change of the  chemical substance except for those chemical changes that may occur as  described elsewhere in this Sec. 710.4(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction  that occurs when (i) a stabilizer, colorant, odorant, antioxidant,  filler, solvent, carrier, surfactant, plasticizer, corrosion inhibitor,  antifoamer or de-foamer, dispersant, precipitation inhibitor, binder,  emulsifier, de-emulsifier, dewatering agent, agglomerating agent,  adhesion promoter, flow modifier, pH neutralizer, sequesterant,  coagulant, flocculant, fire retardant, lubricant, chelating agent, or  quality control reagent functions as intended or (ii) a chemical  substance, solely intended to impart a specific physicochemical  characteristic, functions as intended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Chemical substances which are not intentionally removed from the   equipment in which they were manufactured.</p><p class="depth0">Note: See note to definition of ``intermediate'' at Sec. 710.3(d)  for explanation of ``equipment in which it was manufactured.''
