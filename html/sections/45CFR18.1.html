It represents the American People sheltered in the wing of the American Eagle, suggesting the Department's concern and responsibility for the welfare of the people. This Symbol is the visual link which connects the graphic communications of all components and programs of the Department. It is the major design component for the Department Identifiers -- the Department Logo, Seal, and Signatures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Symbol is described as follows: The outline of an American Eagle, facing left, with one of its wings stretched upward and the other wing pointed downward, is flanked on its right side by two outlines of the profile of a human head, both of which are located in between the eagle's wings. One of the profile outlines is smaller than

the other and is nestled in the larger outline.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MR15.002</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The HHS Departmental Logo (Logo) incorporates the Symbol and is described as follows: From the tip of the outstretched wing of the American Eagle in symbol to the tip of the other, downward-facing wing, the words, ``DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES  USA'' form a circular arc. The official colors of the Logo are either Black or Reflex Blue. Reflex Blue RGB Numbers: 0/0/153 (R0, G0, B153)[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MR15.003</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The HHS Departmental Seal (Seal) incorporates the Symbol and is described as follows: Starting from the tip of the downward-facing wing of the American Eagle in the HHS symbol and forming a complete circle clockwise around the HHS symbol, the words, ``DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES  USA '' are printed, surrounded by a border composed of a solid inner ring at the base of the text and a triangular, scalloped edge at the top of the text.
