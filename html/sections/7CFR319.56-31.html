                            <p class="depth0">Peppers (fruit) (Capsicum spp.) may be imported into the United States from Spain only under permit, and only in accordance with this section and all other applicable requirements of this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The peppers must be grown in the Alicante or Almeria Province of Spain in pest-proof greenhouses registered with, and inspected by, the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The peppers may be shipped only from December 1 through April 30, inclusive;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Beginning October 1, and continuing through April 30, MAFF must set and maintain Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) (Medfly) traps baited with trimedlure inside the greenhouses at a rate of four traps per hectare. In all outside areas, including urban and residential areas, within 8 kilometers of the greenhouses, MAFF must set and maintain Medfly traps baited with trimedlure at a rate of four traps per square kilometer. All traps must be checked every 7 days;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Capture of a single Medfly in a registered greenhouse will immediately halt exports from that greenhouse until the Administrator determines that the source of infestation has been identified, that all Medflies have been eradicated, and that measures have been taken to preclude any future infestation. Capture of a single Medfly within 2 kilometers of a registered greenhouse will necessitate increased trap density in order to determine whether there is a reproducing population in the area. Capture of two Medflies within 2 kilometers of a registered greenhouse during a 1-month period will halt exports from all registered greenhouses within 2 kilometers of the capture, until the source of infestation is determined and all Medflies are eradicated;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The peppers must be safeguarded from harvest to export by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. They must be packed in insect-proof cartons or covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin for transit to the airport and subsequent export to the United

States. These safeguards must be intact upon arrival in the United States;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The peppers must be packed for shipment within 24 hours of harvest;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> During shipment, the peppers may not transit other fruit fly-supporting areas unless shipping containers are sealed by MAFF with an official seal whose number is noted on the phytosanitary certificate; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A phytosanitary certificate issued by MAFF and bearing the declaration, ``These peppers were grown in registered greenhouses in Alicante or Almeria Province in Spain,'' must accompany the consignment.
