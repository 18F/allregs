                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Computation by the HMO or CMP. As indicated in Sec. 417.584(b), before an HMO's or CMP's contract period begins, CMS determines a per capita rate of payment for each class of the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees. In order to determine the additional benefits required under Sec. 417.592, weighted averages of those per capita rates must be computed separately for enrollees entitled to Part A and Part B, and for enrollees entitled only to Part B. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the HMO or CMP must make the computations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation by CMS. If the HMO or CMP claims to have insufficient enrollment experience to make the computations required by paragraph (a) of this section, and CMS agrees with the claim, CMS makes the computations, using the best available information, which may include the enrollment experience of other risk HMOs and CMPs.
