                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Examination. Before making a payment of a security, a paying  agent shall examine the security to determine that it is eligible for  redemption and is one the agent is authorized to pay under the  provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification and evidence of entitlement. The agent shall  determine that   the presenter of the security is entitled to request payment, as  provided in Sec. 321.7 of this part. Unless the presenter is a person  whose identity is well-known to the agent or is an established customer,  he or she should be asked to furnish satisfactory identification in  accordance with the Treasury instructions and guidelines. At the time of  payment, the agent should make a notation on the back of the security,  or in its own records, specifying precisely what was relied on to  establish the presenter's identity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence--Payment to a beneficiary. The agent shall determine  that the presenter of the security as beneficiary is entitled to request  payment, as provided in Sec. 321.7(d). In addition to establishing the  presenter's identification, as required by paragraph (b) of this  section, the agent shall require presentation of the owner's death  certificate in accordance with this part and the appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence--Payment to a legal representative of the last deceased  registrant's estate. The agent shall determine whether the legal  representative is entitled to request payment, as provided in Sec.  321.7(f). In addition to establishing the presenter's identification, as  required by paragraph (b) of this section, the agent shall require  evidence of appointment as well as evidence of the dates of death of all  persons named in the registrations of the securities presented. Evidence  of the representative's appointment must be either a court certificate  or a copy of the letters of appointment, certified to be true and  correct under seal of the court or clerk of court. If the original  appointment was made more than one year prior to the presentation of the  securities it must also bear the court clerk's statement that the  appointment is in full force and effect. This statement must be under  seal of the court or clerk of court and dated within six months of the  presentation. Such evidence of appointment must pertain to the estate of  the last deceased registrant designated on the securities. A copy of a  death certificate, certified under seal of the State or local registrar,  is the only acceptable evidence of the date of death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Execution of request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agent shall require:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the request for payment on the back of each security be  signed by the presenter in the presence of one of its officers or  authorized employees; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the presenter's address be furnished. Fiduciaries must  sign as provided in Sec. 321.7 (e) and (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agent is qualified under 31 CFR part 330 (Circular No.  888, current revision) and elects to use the special endorsement  procedure, the request for payment need not be signed. If the request  has already been signed when the security is presented, it should be  signed again.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification of request. An agent is not required to complete  the certification to the requests for payment on securities it redeems.  When an agent transmits redeemed securities for settlement, as indicated  in Sec. 321.14 of this part, such agent shall be understood by such  submission to have represented and certified that the identity of the  presenter, and his or her entitlement to request payment, have been  established in accordance with this part and the appendix hereto.
