                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring for leaks. The owner or operator of a regulated source subject

to this subpart shall monitor all regulated equipment as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for instrument monitoring and paragraph (a)(2) of this section for sensory monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instrument monitoring for leaks. (i) Valves in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1006(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Valves in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1006(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pumps in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1007(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Connectors in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1008(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Agitators in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1009(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1011(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Compressors designated to operate with an instrument reading less than 500 parts per million as described in Sec.  63.1003(e), shall be monitored pursuant to Sec.  63.1012(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sensory monitoring for leaks. (i) Pumps in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to Sec.  63.1007(b)(3) and (e)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pumps in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to Sec.  63.1007(b)(3) and (e)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Agitators in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to Sec.  63.1009(b)(3) or (e)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Instrument monitoring methods. Instrument monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring method. Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detection instrument performance criteria. (i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid, and not for each individual HAP, VOC or other regulated material individual chemical compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not regulated materials, the representative stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid, and not for each individual HAP, VOC or other regulated material individual chemical compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not regulated materials, the representative stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Detection instrument calibration procedure. The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Detection instrument calibration gas. Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and a mixture of methane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million; or a mixture of n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air or n-hexane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or n-hexane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more compounds to be measured in air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring performance. Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service or is in use with any other detectable material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Monitoring data. Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to initially qualify for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in Sec.  63.1006(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves provided the departures from the criteria specified or from the specified monitoring frequency of Sec.  63.1006(b)(3)

are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every six weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring at a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in the referencing subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Instrument monitoring using background adjustments. The owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. In such case, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with Sec.  63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or Sec.  63.1012(f) (compressors). If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The background level shall be determined, using the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible (as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared to the applicable leak definitions for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with Sec.  63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or Sec.  63.1012(f) (compressors).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sensory monitoring methods. Sensory monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall consist of detection of a potential leak to the atmosphere by visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Leaking equipment identification and records. (1) When each leak is detected pursuant to the monitoring specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with the equipment identification, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When each leak is detected pursuant to the monitoring specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with the equipment identification, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When each leak is detected, the information specified in Sec.  63.1005(e) shall be recorded and kept pursuant to the referencing subpart.
