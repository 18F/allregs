If you elect to file your complaint with the recipient, you must wait  until the recipient issues a decision or until 60 days have passed,  whichever is sooner, before filing with DCR (see address above). If the  recipient has not provided you with a written decision within 60 days of  the filing of the complaint, you need not wait for a decision to be  issued, but may file a complaint with DCR within 30 days of the  expiration of the 60-day period. If you are dissatisfied with the  recipient's resolution of your complaint, you may file a complaint with  DCR. Such complaint must be filed within 30 days of the date you  received notice of the recipient's proposed resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Governor, the SDA grant recipient or the Substate grantee,  as determined by the Governor in that State's Methods of Administration,  shall be responsible for meeting the notice requirement of paragraph (a)  of this section with respect to its service providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Recipient's responsibility to provide notice.

Where such materials indicate that the recipient  may be reached by telephone, the materials shall state the telephone  number of the TDD or relay service used by the recipient, as required by  Sec. 34.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recipients required by law or regulation to publish or broadcast  program information in the news media shall ensure that such  publications and broadcasts state that the JTPA-funded program or  activity in question is an equal opportunity employer/program (or  otherwise indicate that discrimination in the JTPA-funded program or  activity is prohibited by Federal law), and indicate that auxiliary aids  and services are available upon request to individuals with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the  type described in paragraph (b) of this section which suggests, by text  or illustration, that such recipient treats beneficiaries, applicants,  participants, employees or applicants for employment differently on any  prohibited ground specified in Sec. 34.1(a), except as such treatment  is otherwise permitted under Federal law or this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Services or information in a language other than English. A  significant number or proportion of the population eligible to be served  or likely to be directly affected by a JTPA-funded program or activity  may need service or information in a language other than English in  order that they be effectively informed of or able to participate in the  JTPA-funded program or activity.
