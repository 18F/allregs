                            <p class="depth0">Section 104 authorizes and directs the development of guidelines  which include criteria for determining whether work carried out by local  interests is compatible with a project for flood control. Compatible  work which was carried out prior to project authorization, before 17  November 1986 but after 17 November 1981, may be considered part of the  project and credited against the non-Federal share of the cost of  project, if the local sponsor applied for consideration of such work not  later than 31 March 1987. Local work to be carried out after 17 November  1986 must receive Army approval prior to construction to be eligible for  credit, taking into account the economic and environmental feasibility  of the project. (Such approval can only be given on the basis of the  guidelines required to be issued pursuant to section 104(a); hence, the  law is silent with respect to work performed between 17 November 1986  and the effective date of the guidelines.) The credit will not relieve  the non-Federal sponsor of the requirement to pay 5 percent of the  project costs in cash during construction of the remainder of the  project. This legislative authority also provides that benefits and  costs of compatible work will be considered in the economic evaluation  of the Federal project. This includes the costs and benefits of  compatible local work which was carried out after 17 November 1981 or  within the 5 years prior to the initial obligation of reconnaissance  study funds if that should establish a later date.</p>
