The justification and documentation materials submitted as part of the borrower's application for an insured loan also serve as the justification and documentation of the request for a lien accommodation for the required supplemental loan. Unless early approval under Sec. 1717.901 is requested by a borrower, these applications will be processed during the same time as RUS's review of the borrower's application for the concurrent insured loan.</p>
