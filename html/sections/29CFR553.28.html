                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compensatory time which is earned and accrued by an employee for  employment in excess of a nonstatutory (that is, non-FLSA) requirement  is considered ``other'' compensatory time. The term ``other''  compensatory time off means hours during which an employee is not  working and which are not counted as hours worked during the period when  used. For example, a collective bargaining agreement may provide that  compensatory time be granted to employees for hours worked in excess of  8 in a day, or for working on a scheduled day off in a nonovertime  workweek. The FLSA does not require compensatory time to be granted in  such situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compensatory time which is earned and accrued by an employee  working hours which are ``overtime'' hours under State or local law,  ordinance, or other provisions, but which are not overtime hours under  section 7 of the FLSA is also considered ``other'' compensatory time.  For example, a local law or ordinance may provide that compensatory time  be granted to employees for hours worked in excess of 35 in a workweek.  Under section 7(a) of the FLSA, only hours worked in excess of 40 in a  workweek are overtime hours which must be compensated at one and one- half times the regular rate of pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Similarly, compensatory time earned or accrued by an employee  for employment in excess of a standard established by the personnel  policy or practice of an employer, or by custom, which does not result  from the FLSA provision, is another example of ``other'' compensatory  time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The FLSA does not require that the rate at which ``other''  compensatory time is earned has to be at a rate of one and one-half  hours for each hour of employment. The rate at which ``other''  compensatory time is earned may be some lesser or greater multiple of  the rate or the straight-time rate itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements of section 7(o) of the FLSA, including the  limitations on accrued compensatory time, do not apply to ``other''  compensatory time as described above.</p><p class="depth2">Other Exemptions</p>
