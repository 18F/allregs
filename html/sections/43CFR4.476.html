                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The appellant, the State Director or his representative, and  recognized intervenors will stipulate so far as possible all material  facts and the issue or issues involved. The administrative law   judge will state any other issues on which he may wish to have evidence  presented. Issues which appear to the administrative law judge to be  unnecessary to a proper disposition of the case will be excluded; but  the party asserting such issue may state briefly for the record the  substance of the proof which otherwise would have been offered in  support of the issue. Issues not covered by the appellant's  specifications of error may not be admitted except with the consent of  the State Director or his representative, unless the administrative law  judge rules that such issue is essential to the controversy and should  be admitted. The parties will then be given an opportunity to submit  offers of settlement and proposals of adjustment for the consideration  of the administrative law judge and of the other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the administrative law judge orders otherwise, the State  Director or his representative will then make the opening statement,  setting forth the facts leading to the appeal. Upon the conclusion of  the opening statement, the appellant shall present his case, consistent  with his specifications of error. (In the case of a show cause, the  State Director shall set forth the facts leading to the issuance of the  show cause notice and shall present his case following the opening  statement.) Following the appellant's presentation, or upon his failure  to make such presentation, the administrative law judge, upon his own  motion or upon motion of any of the parties, may order summary dismissal  of the appeal with prejudice because of the inadequacy or insufficiency  of the appellant's case, to be followed by a written order setting forth  the reasons for the dismissal and taking such other action under this  subpart as may be proper and warranted. An appeal may be had from such  order as well as from any other final determination made by the  administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the absence or upon denial of such motion the State Director  or his representative and recognized intervenors may present evidence if  such a presentation appears to the administrative law judge to be  necessary for a proper disposition of the matters in controversy,  adhering as closely as possible to the issues raised by the appellant.  All oral testimony shall be under oath or affirmation, and witnesses  shall be subject to cross-examination by any party to the proceeding.  The administrative law judge may question any witness whenever it  appears necessary. Documentary evidence will be received by the  administrative law judge and made a part of the record, if pertinent to  any issue, or may be entered by stipulation. No exception need be stated  or noted and every ruling of the administrative law judge will be  subject to review on appeal. The party affected by an adverse ruling  sustaining an objection to the admission of evidence, may insert in the  record, as a tender of proof, a brief written statement of the substance  of the excluded evidence; and the opposing party may then make an offer  of proof in rebuttal. The administrative law judge shall summarily stop  examination and exclude testimony on any issue which he determines has  been adjudicated previously in an appeal involving the same preference  and the same parties or their predecessors in interest, or which is  obviously irrelevant and immaterial to the issues in the case. At the  conclusion of the testimony the parties at the hearing shall be given a  reasonable opportunity, considering the number and complexity of the  issues and the amount of testimony, to submit to the administrative law  judge proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and reasons in  support thereof, or to stipulate to a waiver of such findings and  conclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The reporter's fees will be borne by the Government. Each party  must pay for any copies of the transcript that the party requests. The  Government will file the original transcript with the case record.  [44 FR 41790, July 18, 1979. Redesignated at 68 FR 68770, Dec. 10, 2003,  as amended at 75 FR 64669, Oct. 20, 2010]</p>
