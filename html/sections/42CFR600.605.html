                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General calculation. The Federal payment for an eligible individual in a given Federal fiscal year is the sum of the premium tax credit component, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the cost-sharing reduction component, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Premium tax credit component. The premium tax credit component equals 95 percent of the premium tax credit for which the eligible individual would have qualified had he or she been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange in a given calendar year, adjusted by the relevant factors described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost-sharing reduction component. The cost-sharing reduction component equals 95 percent of the cost of the cost-sharing reductions for which the eligible individual would have qualified had he or she been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange in a given calendar year adjusted by the relevant factors described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Relevant factors in the payment methodology. In determining the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction components described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will consider the following factors to determine applicable adjustments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Age of the enrollee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income of the enrollee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Self-only or family coverage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Geographic differences in average spending for health care across rating areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Health status of the enrollee for purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance payments had the enrollee been enrolled in

a qualified health plan through an Exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reconciliation of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions had such reconciliation occurred if an enrollee had been enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Marketplace experience in other states with respect to Exchange participation and the effect of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions provided to residents, particularly those residents with income below 200 percent of the FPL; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Other factors affecting the development of the methodology as determined by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual adjustments to payment methodology. The Secretary will adjust the payment methodology on a prospective basis to adjust for any changes in the calculation of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction components to the extent that necessary data is available for the Secretary to prospectively determine all relevant factors, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
