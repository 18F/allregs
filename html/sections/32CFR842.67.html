                            <p class="depth0">This paragraph provides the procedures used to reconsider a final denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An FCC may reopen, reverse, or reconsider, in whole or in part, any claim it previously decided if the request for reconsideration is received in a reasonable time. Sixty days is considered a reasonable time, but the FCC may waive the time limit for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An FCC reconsiders the final action on a claim when there is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New and material evidence concerning the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obvious error in facts or calculation of the original settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fraud or collusion in the original submission of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FCC must state the reason for reconsideration in its opinion. A court decision is not in itself sufficient basis for reconsidering a claim, but the facts that resulted in the judgment may warrant reconsideration. The amount of a court judgment is not binding on a FCC's determination of damage, but the commission may consider the judgment as evidence of the local law on the subject.</p>
