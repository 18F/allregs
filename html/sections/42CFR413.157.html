                                Sec. 413.157  Return on equity capital of proprietary providers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2">Proprietary provider means a provider that is organized and operated with the expectation of earning a profit for its owners (as distinguished from a provider that is organized and operated on a nonprofit basis). Proprietary providers may be sole proprietorships, partnerships, or corporations. Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 6, 1987, the term applies only to proprietary hospitals and SNFs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. A reasonable return on equity capital invested and used in

the provision of patient care is paid as an allowance in addition to the reasonable cost of covered services furnished to beneficiaries by proprietary providers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rate of return applicable to proprietary providers for cost reporting periods beginning before July 6, 1987. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, the amount allowable on an annual basis, for cost reporting periods beginning before July 6, 1987, is determined by multiplying the provider's equity capital by a percentage equal to one and one-half times the average of the rates of interest on special issues of public debt obligations issued for purchase by the Medicare Part A Trust Fund for each of the months during the provider's reporting period or portion thereof covered under the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rate of return for inpatient hospital services furnished by proprietary hospitals. The rate used in determining the return for inpatient hospital services is a percentage of the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The percentages applicable to inpatient hospital services are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 150 percent for cost reporting periods beginning before April 20, 1983.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 100 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 20, 1983 and before October 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 75 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 50 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 and before October 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> 25 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1988 and before October 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Zero percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rate of return related to proprietary SNFs. (i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate used in determining the return for SNF services furnished before October 1, 1993, is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate used in determining the return for SNF services furnished before October 1, 1993, is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is no allowance for return for SNF services furnished on or after October 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rate of return related to outpatient hospital services. (i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate used in determining the return for outpatient hospital services furnished before January 1, 1988 is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate used in determining the return for outpatient hospital services furnished before January 1, 1988 is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is no allowance for return for outpatient hospital services furnished on or after January 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Rate of return for proprietary services of all nonhospital and non-SNF providers. (i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, but before July 6, 1987, the rate used in determining the return for services of all nonhospital and non-SNF providers is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, but before July 6, 1987, the rate used in determining the return for services of all nonhospital and non-SNF providers is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 6, 1987, there is no allowance for return on equity capital for nonhospital and non-SNF providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application--(1) Computation of equity capital. For purposes of computing the allowable return, the provider's equity capital means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Computation of equity capital. For purposes of computing the allowable return, the provider's equity capital means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provider's investment in plant, property, and equipment related to patient care (net of depreciation) and funds deposited by a provider who leases plant, property, or equipment related to patient care and is required by the terms of the lease to deposit such funds (net of noncurrent debt related to such investment or deposited funds); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Net working capital maintained for necessary and proper operation of patient care activities. However, debt representing loans from partners, stockholders, or related organizations on which interest payments would be allowable as costs but for the provisions of Sec. 413.153(b)(3)(ii), is not subtracted in computing the amount of equity capital in order that the proceeds from such loans be treated as part of the provider's equity capital. In computing the amount of equity capital upon which a return is allowable, investment in facilities is recognized on the basis of the historical cost, or other basis, used for depreciation and other purposes under Part A of Medicare.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions after July 1970. With respect to a facility or any tangible assets of a facility acquired on or after August 1, 1970, the excess of the price paid for such facility or such tangible assets over the historical cost, as defined in Sec. 413.134(b), or the cost basis, as determined under Sec. 413.134(g) (whichever is appropriate), is not includable in equity capital, and loans made to finance such excess portion of the cost of such acquisitions (see Sec. 413.153(d)) are excluded in computing equity capital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acquisitions prior to August 1970. With respect to a facility or any tangible assets of a facility acquired before August 1970, the excess of the price paid for such facility or assets over the fair market value of tangible assets at the time of purchase is includable in equity capital to the extent that it is reasonable except that the cumulative allowable return for such excess may not exceed 100 percent of such excess. For purposes of this section, the cumulative allowable return means the sum of the allowable rate of return on equity capital for all months starting from August 1, 1970. For example, if the allowable rates of return on equity capital for a provider are 9 percent for the first year (and such year started August 1, 1970), 8.5 percent for the second year, and 10.5 percent for the third year, the cumulative allowable return at the end of the third year would be 28 percent. After the cumulative allowable return equals 100 percent, the inclusion in equity capital of the excess is no longer allowable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Computation of return on equity capital. For purposes of computing the allowable return, the amount of equity capital is the average investment during the reporting period. The rate of return allowed, as derived from time to time based upon interest rates in accordance with this principle, is determined by CMS and communicated through contractors. Return on investment as an element of allowable costs is subject to apportionment in the same manner as other elements of allowable costs.</p><p class="depth3">Example of calculation of cumulative allowable return. X purchased a provider on July 1, 1969, paying $100,000 in excess f the fair market value of the assets acquired. Provider X files its cost report on a calendar-year basis. The allowable rate of return on equity capital for August 1, 1970-December 31, 1970 (4.538 percent), is obtained by multiplying the allowable rate of return for the period ending December 31, 1970 (10.891) by \5/12\ (a fraction of which the numerator is the number of months from August 1, 1970, to the end of the cost-reporting period and the denominator is the number of months in the cost-reporting period). The cumulative allowable return for Provider X for the period August 1, 1970-December 31, 1973, (32.367 percent) is computed as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Rate of</p><p class="depth3">return on</p><p class="depth3">Cost reporting year ending                     equity</p><p class="depth3">capital</p><p class="depth3"><em>(percent)</em>------------------------------------------------------------------------Dec. 31, 1970................................................      4.538Dec. 31, 1971................................................      8.969Dec. 31, 1972................................................      8.891Dec. 31, 1973................................................      9.969</p><p class="depth3">----------</p><p class="depth3">Total..................................................     32.367------------------------------------------------------------------------

(The $100,000 paid in excess of the fair market value of the assets acquired is included in equity capital until the sum of the allowable rate of return on equity capital equals 100 percent. Of course, no portion of the $100,000 may be amortized as an allowable cost or is otherwise allowable for any program reimbursement purposes other than for determining the provider's equity capital.
