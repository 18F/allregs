                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The maximum rate of Federal participation for FHWA planning and research funds shall be as prescribed in title 23, U.S.C., for the specific class of funds used (i.e., SPR, PL, NHS, STP, or MG) except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The provisions of 49 CFR 18.24 or 49 CFR 19.23 are applicable to any necessary matching of FHWA planning and research funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The value of third party in-kind contributions may be accepted as the match for FHWA planning and research funds, in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.24(a)(2) or 49 CFR 19.23(a) and may be on either a total planning work program basis or for specific line items or projects. The use of third party in-kind contributions must be identified in the original work program/scope of work and the grant/

subgrant agreement, or amendments thereto. The use of third-party in-kind contributions must be approved in advance by the FHWA Division Administrator and may not be made retroactive prior to approval of the work program/scope of work or an amendment thereto. The State DOT or subrecipient is responsible for ensuring that the following additional criteria are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The third party performing the work agrees to allow the value of the work to be used as the match;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of the third party work is not paid for by other Federal funds or used as a match for other federally funded grants/subgrants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The work performed by the third party is an eligible transportation planning or RD&T; related activity that benefits the federally funded work;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The third party costs (i.e., salaries, fringe benefits, etc.) are allowable under the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles (i.e., OMB Circular A-21, A-87, or A-122);\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ OMB Circulars are available on the Internet at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/index.html.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The third party work is performed during the period to which the matching requirement applies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The third party in-kind contributions are verifiable from the records of the State DOT or subrecipient and these records show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the total amount of third party expenditures at the end of the program period is not sufficient to match the total expenditure of Federal funds by the recipient/subrecipient, the recipient/subrecipient will need to make up any shortfall with its own funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120(j), toll revenues that are generated and used by public, quasi-public, and private agencies to build, improve, or maintain highways, bridges, or tunnels that serve the public purpose of interstate commerce may be used as a credit for the non-Federal share of an FHWA planning and research funded project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 505(c) or 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(3), the requirement for matching SPR or PL funds may be waived if the FHWA determines the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served. Waiver of the matching requirement is intended to encourage State DOTs and/or MPOs to pool SPR and/or PL funds to address national or regional high priority planning or RD&T; problems that would benefit multiple States and/or MPOs. Requests for waiver of matching requirements must be submitted to the FHWA headquarters office for approval by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Environment (for planning activities) or the Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology (for RD&T; activities). The matching requirement may not be waived for NHS, STP, or MG funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NHS, STP, or MG funds used for eligible planning and RD&T; purposes must be identified separately from SPR or PL funds in the work program(s) and must be administered and accounted for separately for fiscal purposes. In accordance with the statewide and metropolitan planning process requirements for fiscally constrained transportation improvement program (TIPs) planning or RD&T; activities funded with NHS, STP, or MG funds must be included in the Statewide and/or metropolitan TIP(s) unless the State DOT and MPO (for a metropolitan area) agree that they may be excluded from the TIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.21 or 49 CFR 19.22.</p>
