The following applies to the external visual inspection and testing of cargo tanks:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where insulation precludes a complete external visual inspection as required by paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(6) of this section, the cargo tank also must be given an internal visual inspection in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. If external visual inspection is precluded because any part of the cargo tank wall is externally lined, coated, or designed to prevent an external visual inspection, those areas of the cargo tank must be internally inspected. If internal visual inspection is precluded because the cargo tank is lined, coated, or designed

so as to prevent access for internal inspection, the tank must be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. Those items able to be externally inspected must be externally inspected and noted in the inspection report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The external visual inspection and testing must include as a minimum the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded or abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds and any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The piping, valves, and gaskets must be carefully inspected for corroded areas, defects in welds, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All devices for tightening manhole covers must be operative and there must be no evidence of leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All emergency devices and valves including self-closing stop valves, excess flow valves and remote closure devices must be free from corrosion, distortion, erosion and any external damage that will prevent safe operation.

At least four symmetrically distributed readings must be taken to establish an average thickness for the ring stiffener or appurtenance. If any thickness reading is less than the average thickness by more than 10%, thickness testing in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section must be conducted from the inside of the cargo tank on the area of the tank wall covered by the appurtenance or ring stiffener.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The gaskets on any full opening rear head must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Visually inspected for cracks or splits caused by weather or wear; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Replaced if cuts or cracks which are likely to cause leakage, or are of a depth one-half inch or more, are found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The inspector must record the results of the external visual examination as specified in Sec. 180.417(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Internal visual inspection. (1) When the cargo tank is not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, or the cargo tank design precludes an internal inspection, the tank shall be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with 180.407(c) and (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The internal visual inspection must include as a minimum the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tank liners must be inspected as specified in Sec. 180.407(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The inspector must record the results of the internal visual inspection as specified in Sec. 180.417(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Lining inspection. The integrity of the lining on all lined cargo tanks, when lining is required by this subchapter, must be verified at least once each year as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rubber (elastomeric) lining must be tested for holes as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equipment must consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A high frequency spark tester capable of producing sufficient voltage to ensure proper calibration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A probe with an ``L'' shaped 2.4 mm (0.09 inch) diameter wire with up to a 30.5 cm (12-inch) bottom leg (end bent to a 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) radius), or equally sensitive probe; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A steel calibration coupon 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm (12 inches x 12 inches) covered with the same material and thickness as that to be tested. The material on the coupon shall have a test hole to the metal substrate made by puncturing the material with a 22 gauge hypodermic needle or comparable piercing tool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The probe must be passed over the surface of the calibration coupon in a constant uninterrupted manner until the hole is found. The hole is detected by the white or light blue spark formed. (A sound lining causes a dark blue or purple spark.) The voltage must be adjusted to the lowest setting that will produce a minimum 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) spark measured from the top of the lining to the probe. To assure that the setting on the probe has not changed, the spark tester must be calibrated periodically using the test calibration coupon, and the same power source, probe, and cable length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After calibration, the probe must be passed over the lining in an uninterrupted stroke.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Holes that are found must be repaired using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Linings made of other than rubber (elastomeric material) must be tested using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Degraded or defective areas of the cargo tank liner must be removed and the cargo tank wall below the defect must be inspected. Corroded areas of the tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The inspector must record the results of the lining inspection as specified in Sec. 180.417(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Pressure test. All components of the cargo tank wall, as defined in Sec. 178.320(a) of this subchapter, must be pressure tested as prescribed by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Test Procedure--(i) As part of the pressure test, the inspector must perform an external and internal visual inspection, except that on an MC 338 cargo tank, or a cargo tank not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, an internal inspection is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All self-closing pressure relief valves, including emergency relief vents and normal vents, must be removed from the cargo tank for inspection and testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each self-closing pressure relief valve that is an emergency relief vent must open at no less than the required set pressure and no more than 110 percent of the required set pressure, and must reseat to a leak-tight condition at no less than 90 percent of the start-to-discharge pressure or the pressure

prescribed for the applicable cargo tank specification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Normal vents (1 psig vents) must be tested according to the testing criteria established by the valve manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Self-closing pressure relief devices not tested or failing the tests in this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) must be repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except for cargo tanks carrying lading corrosive to the tank, areas covered by the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service. The upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be removed from the cargo tank for this inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Each cargo tank must be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically to the internal pressure specified in the following table. At no time during the pressure test may a cargo tank be subject to pressures that exceed those identified in the following table:

All prescribed loading and unloading venting devices rated at less than test pressure may be removed during the test. If retained, the devices must be rendered inoperative by clamps, plugs, or other equally effective restraining devices. Restraining devices may not prevent detection of leaks or damage the venting devices and must be removed immediately after the test is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Hydrostatic test method. Each cargo tank, including its domes, must be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, at a temperature not exceeding 100 F. The cargo tank must then be pressurized to not less than the pressure specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. The cargo tank, including its closures, must hold the prescribed test pressure for at least 10 minutes during which time it shall be inspected for leakage, bulging or any other defect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Pneumatic test method. Pneumatic testing may involve higher risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas. The pneumatic test pressure in the cargo tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. The test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes. The pressure must then be reduced to the MAWP, which must be maintained during the time the entire cargo tank surface is inspected. During the inspection, a suitable method must be used for detecting the existence of leaks. This method must consist either of coating the entire surface of all joints under pressure with a solution of soap and water, or using other equally sensitive methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When testing an insulated cargo tank, the insulation and jacketing need not be removed unless it is otherwise impossible to reach test pressure and maintain a condition of pressure equilibrium after test pressure is reached, or the vacuum integrity cannot be maintained in the insulation space. If an MC 338 cargo tank used for the transportation of a flammable gas or oxygen, refrigerated liquid is opened for any reason, the cleanliness must be

verified prior to closure using the procedures contained in Sec. 178.338-15 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), or constructed of other than quenched and tempered steel but without postweld heat treatment, used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any other hazardous materials that may cause corrosion stress cracking, must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code and used for the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. The wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection must be in accordance with Section V of the ASME Code and CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). This paragraph does not apply to cargo tanks that do not have manholes. (See Sec. 180.417(c) for reporting requirements.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All pressure bearing portions of a cargo tank heating system employing a medium such as, but not limited to, steam or hot water for heating the lading must be hydrostatically pressure tested at least once every 5 years. The test pressure must be at least the maximum system design operating pressure and must be maintained for five minutes. A heating system employing flues for heating the lading must be tested to ensure against lading leakage into the flues or into the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions. (i) Pressure testing is not required for MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks in dedicated sodium metal service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pressure testing is not required for uninsulated lined cargo tanks, with a design pressure or MAWP of 15 psig or less, which receive an external visual inspection and a lining inspection at least once each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Acceptance criteria. A cargo tank that leaks, fails to retain test pressure or pneumatic inspection pressure, shows distortion, excessive permanent expansion, or other evidence of weakness that might render the cargo tank unsafe for transportation service, may not be returned to service, except as follows: A cargo tank with a heating system which does not hold pressure may remain in service as an unheated cargo tank if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The heating system remains in place and is structurally sound and no lading may leak into the heating system, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The specification plate heating system information is changed to indicate that the cargo tank has no working heating system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The inspector must record the results of the pressure test as specified in Sec. 180.417(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Leakage test. The following requirements apply to cargo tanks requiring a leakage test:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each cargo tank must be tested for leaks in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The leakage test must include testing product piping with all valves and accessories in place and operative, except that any venting devices set to discharge at less than the leakage test pressure must be removed or rendered inoperative during the test. All internal or external self-closing stop valves must be tested for leak tightness. Each cargo tank of a multi-cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure. Test pressure must be maintained for at least 5 minutes. Cargo tanks in liquefied compressed gas service must be externally inspected for leaks during the leakage test. Suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel should a failure occur. Cargo tanks may be leakage tested with hazardous materials contained in the cargo tank during the test. Leakage test pressure must be no less than 80% of MAWP marked on the specification plate except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A cargo tank with an MAWP of 690 kPa (100 psig) or more may be leakage

tested at its maximum normal operating pressure provided it is in dedicated service or services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in dedicated liquified petroleum gas service may be leakage tested at not less than 414 kPa (60 psig).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An operator of a specification MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank, and a nonspecification cargo tank authorized under Sec. 173.315(k) of this subchapter, equipped with a meter may check leak tightness of the internal self-closing stop valve by conducting a meter creep test.
