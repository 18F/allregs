                            <p class="depth0">Any Commission action deemed to have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment requires the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (collectively referred to as EISs) (see Secs. 1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317). The Commission has reviewed representative actions and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify actions that will thus automatically require EISs.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Our current application forms refer applicants to Sec. 1.1305 to determine if their proposals are such that the submission of environmental information is required (see Sec. 1.1311). Until the application forms are revised to reflect our new environmental rules, applicants should refer to Sec. 1.1307. Section 1.1307 now delineates those actions for which applicants must submit environmental information.</p>
