                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any engine that fails a production line test pursuant to Sec. 94.510(a), effective from the time the testing of that engine is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for an engine family which is in noncompliance pursuant to Sec. 94.510(b), thirty days after the engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the results of testing pursuant to this subpart indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator may suspend a certificate of conformity for any engine family in whole or in part if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer fails to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An EPA enforcement officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities authorized in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An EPA enforcement officer is unable to conduct activities authorized in Sec. 94.504 for any reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part; a suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of such notification or thirty days from the time an engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance under Secs. 94.508(d), 94.510(a), or 94.510(b), whichever is earlier, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the remedy is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remedy the nonconformity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards or family emission limits by retesting if applicable, the engine in accordance with this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Once a certificate for a failed engine family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the remedy, including a description of any quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with the regulations of this part by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. Such testing must comply with the provisions of this subpart. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family emission limits through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Once the certificate has been revoked for an engine family, if the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may issue a certificate for that modified family:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Administrator determines that the change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the change or changes or whether additional testing will be required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with the regulations of this part by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. When both

of these requirements are met, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family. If this subsequent testing reveals failing data the revocation remains in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 30 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraphs (a),(b),(c) and (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with Secs. 94.513, 94.514, and 94.515; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Need not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section or voids a certificate of conformity under paragraph Sec. 94.215, and prior to the commencement of a hearing under Sec. 94.513, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines while conducting subsequent testing of the noncomplying family, a manufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the following condition: the manufacturer must commit to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails subsequent testing and must commit to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</p>
