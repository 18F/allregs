                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subgrants required. Each State that receives a grant under section 611 of the Act for any fiscal year must distribute any funds the State does not reserve under Sec. 300.704 to LEAs (including public charter schools that operate as LEAs) in the State that have established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act for use in accordance with Part B of the Act. Effective with funds that become available on the July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to eligible LEAs, including public charter schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any children with disabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocations to LEAs. For each fiscal year for which funds are allocated to States under Sec. 300.703, each State shall allocate funds as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Base payments. The State first must award each LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section the amount the LEA would have received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999, if the State had distributed 75 percent of its grant for that year under section 611(d) of the Act, as that section was then in effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Base payment adjustments. For any fiscal year after 1999--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a new LEA is created, the State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities

ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under Sec. 300.703(b), currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the State must combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If, for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative responsibility for providing services to children with disabilities ages 3 through 21 change, the base allocations of affected LEAs must be redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under Sec. 300.703(b), currently provided special education by each affected LEA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for the first fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it is serving any children with disabilities. The State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the LEA, among the LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 currently provided special education by each of the LEAs. This requirement takes effect with funds that become available on July 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as adjusted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reallocation of LEA funds. (1) If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities residing in the area served by that agency with State and local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under this part that are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 300.704.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities residing in the area served by that agency with State and local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under this part that are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 300.704.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After an SEA distributes funds under this part to an eligible LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of time prior to the end of the carryover period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may reallocate any of those funds not obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 300.704.
