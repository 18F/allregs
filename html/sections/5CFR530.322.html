                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. When an employee holds a position that becomes  covered by a newly established special rate schedule (including a  schedule for which coverage is expanded) or increased special rate  schedule (including an increased special rate range within a schedule),  the agency must set the employee's special rate at the step (or relative  position in range for a GM employee) of the grade on the new special  rate schedule that corresponds to the employee's existing numerical step  (or relative position in range for a GM employee) as in effect  immediately before the new special rate schedule takes effect, except as  otherwise provided in this section. The corresponding special rate is  determined by adding the applicable special rate supplement on top of  the employee's GS rate, subject to the limitation that no special rate  may exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule. For an  employee receiving an LEO special base rate, add the applicable special  rate supplement to the GS rate for the employee's grade and step, except  as otherwise provided under Sec. 530.304(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee entitled to a higher rate of basic pay. As provided in  Sec. 530.303(d), if an employee meeting the coverage conditions for a  newly established or increased special rate schedule is entitled to a  higher rate of basic pay under other legal authority, the employee must  be paid at that higher rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employee receiving a retained rate. When an employee is  receiving a retained rate immediately before the employee's position is  covered by a newly established or increased special rate schedule, the  agency must determine the employee's rate of pay consistent with the  requirements in 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or 5 CFR 359.705 for a former  member of the Senior Executive   Service receiving a retained rate under that section).
