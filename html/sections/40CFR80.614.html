                            <p class="depth0">Any person who blends a MVNRLM diesel fuel additive package into MVNRLM diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standards of Sec. 80.510(b) or (c) or Sec. 80.520(a) which contains a static dissipater additive that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.4 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and/or red dye that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.04 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and which contains no other additives with a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm must establish all the following in order to use this section as an alternative to the defense element under Sec. 80.613(a)(1)(vi):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The blender of the additive package has a sulfur content test result for the MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to blending of the additive package that indicates that the additive package, when added, will not cause the MVNRLM diesel fuel sulfur content to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The blender of the additive package has a sulfur content test result for the MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to blending of the additive package that indicates that the additive package, when added, will not cause the MVNRLM diesel fuel sulfur content to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, the blender of the additive package must have sulfur test results on each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel that was added to the storage tank during the current and previous volumetric accounting reconciliation (VAR) periods, which indicates that the additive package, when added to the component MVNRLM diesel fuel batch in the storage tank with the highest sulfur level would not cause that component batch to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The VAR standard is attained as determined under the provisions of this section. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained when the actual concentration of the additive package used per the VAR formula record under paragraph (f) of this section is less than the concentration that would have caused any batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to exceed a sulfur content of 15 ppm given the maximum sulfur test result on any MVNRLM diesel fuel batch described in paragraph (a) of this section that is additized with the additive package during the VAR period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The product transfer document complies with the applicable sulfur information requirements of Sec. 80.591.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If more than one additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye is used during a VAR period, then a separate VAR formula record must be created for MVNRLM diesel fuel additized for each of the additive packages used. In such cases, the amount of the each additive package used must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recorded volumes of MVNRLM diesel fuel and the additive package must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that additive package volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded upward to the next higher gallon for purposes of determining compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automated blending facilities. In the case of an automated additive package blending facility, for each VAR period, for each storage system for an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, and each additive package in that storage system, the following must be recorded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level. The intended treatment level is the treatment level that the additive injection equipment is set to.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level. The intended treatment level is the treatment level that the additive injection equipment is set to.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of the additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures. If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total volume of the additive package blended into MVNRLM diesel fuel, in accordance with one of the following methods, as applicable.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure usage, the total volume of additive package measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the additive package storage tank, the total volume of additive package shall be calculated from the following equation:
Additive package volume = (A) - (B) + (C) - (D)
Where:
A = Initial additive package inventory of the tankB = Final additive package inventory of the tankC = Sum of any additions to additive package inventoryD = Sum of any withdrawals from additive package inventory for purposes</p><p class="depth5">other than the additization of MVNRLM diesel fuel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The value of each variable in the equation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each additive package addition included in variable C and a list of each additive package withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the

following: the beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The actual concentration of the additive package, calculated as the total volume of the additive package added (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), divided by the total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to 4 significant figures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A list of each additive package concentration rate set for the additive package that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted above the maximum recommended concentration supplied by the additive manufacturer, except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any additive package concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The concentration setting for the additive package injector may be changed from the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The purpose of the change is to correct a batch under-additization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction where there has been no over-additization of the additive;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of this paragraph (f);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of additive package used in this procedure is not added to MVNRLM diesel fuel within the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the additive package volume listed on the VAR formula record. In such a case, the addition of this amount of additive must be reflected in the following VAR period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The measured sulfur level for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is added during each VAR period. In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, a measured sulfur level on each batch added to the storage tank during the current and previous VAR periods must be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-automated facilities. In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend the additive packages, for each additive package and for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is being added, the following shall be recorded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the additive package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The volume of added additive package.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The volume of the MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package has been added.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The brand (if known) of MVNRLM diesel fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The actual additive package concentration, calculated as the volume of added additive package (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), divided by the volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section).

Automated static dissipater additive package blenders must calibrate their additive package equipment at least once in each calendar half year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than one hundred twenty days apart, except that calibrations may be closer in time so long as at least two calibrations meet the requirements to be in separate halves of the calendar year and no less than 120 days apart. Equipment recalibration is also required each time the static dissipater additive package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new additive package has the same viscosity as the previous additive package. Additive package change calibrations may be used to satisfy the semiannual requirement provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate half calendar year and are no less than one hundred twenty days apart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Additional VAR documentation.
