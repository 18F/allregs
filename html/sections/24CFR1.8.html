                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part 1, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part 1 may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to: (1) A reference to the

Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 1.5. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 1.5 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to a contract therefor approved prior to January 3, 1965.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part 1, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this part 1 and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</p>
