                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this rule is to indicate the various line items and certain additional disclosures which, if applicable, and except as otherwise permitted by the Commission, should appear on the face of the balance sheets or related notes filed for the persons to whom this article pertains (see Sec. 210.4-01(a)).</p><p class="depth0">Assets and Other Debits</p><p class="depth0">Current Assets, when appropriate</p><p class="depth0">[See Sec. 210.4-05]</p><p class="depth0">1. Cash and cash items. Separate disclosure shall be made of the cash and cash items which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. The provisions of any restrictions shall be described in a note to the financial statements. Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against short-term borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits; however, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are not generally included in legally restricted deposits. In cases where compensating balance arrangements exist but are not agreements which legally restrict the use of cash amounts shown on the balance sheet, describe in the notes to the financial statements these arrangements and the amount involved, if determinable, for the most recent audited balance sheet required and for any subsequent unaudited balance sheet required in the notes to the financial statements. Compensating balances that are maintained under an agreement to assure future credit availability shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements along with the amount and terms of such agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Marketable securities. The accounting and disclosure requirements for current marketable equity securities are specified by generally accepted accounting principles. With respect to all other current marketable securities, state, parenthetically or otherwise, the basis of determining the aggregate amount shown in the balance sheet, along with the alternatives of the aggregate cost or the aggregate market value at the balance sheet date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State separately amounts receivable from (1) customers (trade); (2) related parties (see Sec. 210.4-08(k)); (3) underwriters, promoters, and employees (other than related parties) which arose in other than the ordinary course of business; and (4) others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the aggregate amount of notes receivable exceeds 10 percent of the aggregate amount of receivables, the above information shall be set forth separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, for accounts receivable and notes receivable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If receivables include amounts due under long-term contracts (see Sec. 210.5-02.6(d)), state separately in the balance sheet or in a note to the financial statements the following amounts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Balances billed but not paid by customers under retainage provisions in contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts representing the recognized sales value of performance and such amounts that had not been billed and were not billable to customers at the date of the balance sheet. Include a general description of the prerequisites for billing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Billed or unbilled amounts representing claims or other similar items subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. Include a description of the nature and status of the principal items comprising such amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to (1) through (3) above, also state the amounts included in each item

which are expected to be collected after one year. Also state, by year, if practicable, when the amounts of retainage (see (1) above) are expected to be collected.</p><p class="depth0">4.

If the method of calculating a LIFO inventory does not allow for the practical determination of amounts assigned to major classes of inventory, the amounts of those classes may be stated under cost flow assumptions other that LIFO with the excess of such total amount over the aggregate LIFO amount shown as a deduction to arrive at the amount of the LIFO inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The basis of determining the amounts shall be stated.</p><p class="depth2">If cost is used to determine any portion of the inventory amounts, the description of this method shall include the nature of the cost elements included in inventory. Elements of cost include, among other items, retained costs representing the excess of manufacturing or production costs over the amounts charged to cost of sales or delivered or in-process units, initial tooling or other deferred startup costs, or general and administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2">The method by which amounts are removed from inventory (e.g., average cost, first-in, first-out, last-in, first-out, estimated average cost per unit) shall be described. If the estimated average cost per unit is used as a basis to determine amounts removed from inventory under a total program or similar basis of accounting, the principal assumptions (including, where meaningful, the aggregate number of units expected to be delivered under the program, the number of units delivered to date and the number of units on order) shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2">If any general and administrative costs are charged to inventory, state in a note to the financial statements the aggregate amount of the general and administrative costs incurred in each period and the actual or estimated amount remaining in inventory at the date of each balance sheet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the LIFO inventory method is used, the excess of replacement or current cost over stated LIFO value shall, if material, be stated parenthetically or in a note to the financial statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 210.5-02.3 and 210.5-02.6, long-term contracts or programs include (1) all contracts or programs for which gross profits are recognized on a percentage-of-completion method of accounting or any variant thereof (e.g., delivered unit, cost to cost, physical completion), and (2) any contracts or programs accounted for on a completed contract basis of accounting where, in either case, the contracts or programs have associated with them material amounts of inventories or unbilled receivables and where such contracts or programs have been or are expected to be performed over a period of more than twelve months. Contracts or programs of shorter duration may also be included, if deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth2">For all long-term contracts or programs, the following information, if applicable, shall be stated in a note to the financial statements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of manufacturing or production costs and any related deferred costs (e.g., initial tooling costs) which exceeds the aggregate estimated cost of all in-process and delivered units on the basis of the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced under long-term contracts and programs not yet complete, as well as that portion of such amount which would not be absorbed in cost of sales based on existing firm orders at the latest balance sheet date. In addition, if practicable, disclose the amount of deferred costs by type of cost (e.g., initial tooling, deferred production, etc.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount representing claims or other similar items subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization, and include a description of the nature and status of the principal items comprising such aggregate amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of progress payments netted against inventory at the date of the balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0">7.

Accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization of property, plant and equipment. The amount is to be set forth separately in the balance sheet or in a note thereto.</p><p class="depth0">15. Intangible assets. State separately each class of such assets which is in excess of five percent of the total assets, along with the basis of determining the respective amounts.
