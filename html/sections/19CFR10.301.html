                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of Sec. Sec. 10.302 through 10.311 of this part  relate to the procedures for obtaining duty preferences on imported  goods under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (the  Agreement) entered into on January 2, 1988, and the United States-Canada  Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 1851). The  United States and Canada agreed to suspend operation of the Agreement  with effect from January 1, 1994, to coincide with the entry into force  of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see part 181 of this  chapter) and, accordingly, the provisions of Sec. Sec. 10.302 through  10.311 of this part apply only to goods imported from Canada that   were entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for  consumption, during the period January 1, 1989, through December 31,  1993. In situations involving goods subject to bilateral restrictions or  prohibitions, or country of origin marking, other criteria for  determining origin may be applicable pursuant to Article 407 of the  Agreement.
