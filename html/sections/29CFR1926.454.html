those hazards. The training shall include the following areas, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The nature of any electrical hazards, fall hazards and falling object hazards in the work area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The correct procedures for dealing with electrical hazards and for erecting, maintaining, and disassembling the fall protection systems and falling object protection systems being used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The proper use of the scaffold, and the proper handling of materials on the scaffold;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The maximum intended load and the load-carrying capacities of the scaffolds used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any other pertinent requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The employer shall have each employee who is involved in erecting, disassembling, moving, operating, repairing, maintaining, or inspecting a scaffold trained by a competent person to recognize any hazards associated with the work in question.

Retraining is required in at least the following situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where changes at the worksite present a hazard about which an employee has not been previously trained; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where changes in the types of scaffolds, fall protection, falling object protection, or other equipment present a hazard about which an employee has not been previously trained; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where inadequacies in an affected employee's work involving scaffolds indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite proficiency.</p><p class="depth0">Non-Mandatory Appendices</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

An employer may use these guidelines and tables as a starting point for designing scaffold systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all the information necessary to build a complete system, and the employer is still responsible for designing and assembling these components in such a way that the completed system will meet the requirements of Sec. 1926.451(a). Scaffold components which are not selected and loaded in accordance with this Appendix, and components for which no specific guidelines or tables are given in this appendix (e.g., joints, ties, components for wood pole scaffolds more than 60 feet in height, components for heavy-duty horse scaffolds, components made with other materials, and components with other dimensions, etc.) must be designed and constructed in accordance with the capacity requirements of Sec. 1926.451(a), and loaded in accordance with Sec. 1926.451(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Index to appendix A for Subpart L</p><p class="depth0">1.

(1) In addition to direct connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors) acceptable ways to prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and static lines. Angulated roping is a system of platform suspension in which the upper wire rope sheaves or suspension points are closer to the plane of the building face than the corresponding attachment points on the platform, thus causing the platform to press against the face of the building. Static lines are separate ropes secured at their top and bottom ends closer to the plane of the building face than the outermost edge of the platform. By drawing the static line taut, the platform is drawn against the face of the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In addition to direct connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors) acceptable ways to prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and static lines.
