                            <p class="depth0">A grantee may use ICDBG funds for special economic development  activities in addition to other activities authorized in this subpart  which may be carried out as part of an economic development project.  Special activities authorized under this section do not include  assistance for the construction of new housing. Special economic  development activities include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or  installation of commercial or industrial buildings, structures, and  other real property equipment and improvements, including railroad spurs  or similar extensions. Such activities may be carried out by the grantee  or public or private nonprofit subrecipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provision of assistance to a private for-profit business,  including, but not limited to, grants, loans, loan guarantees, interest  supplements, technical assistance, and other forms of support, for any  activity where the assistance is necessary or appropriate to carry out  an economic development project, excluding those described as ineligible  in Sec. 1003.207(a). In order to ensure that any such assistance does  not unduly enrich the for-profit business, the grantee shall conduct an  analysis to determine that the amount of any financial assistance to be  provided is not excessive, taking into account the actual needs of the  business in making the project financially feasible and the extent of  public benefit expected to be derived from the economic development  project. The grantee shall document the analysis as well as any factors  it considered in making its determination that the assistance is  necessary or appropriate to carry out the project. The requirement for  making such a determination applies whether the business is to receive  assistance from the grantee or through a subrecipient.
