                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Energy output. Blasting units shall meet the acceptable  performance criteria of the output energy test in Sec. 7.66.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum blasting circuit resistance. The maximum value of the  resistance   of the blasting circuit that can be connected to the firing line  terminals of the blasting unit, without exceeding its capacity, shall be  specified by the applicant. The specified maximum blasting circuit  resistance shall be at least 150 ohms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Visual indicator. The blasting unit shall provide a visual  indication to the user prior to the operation of the firing switch when  the voltage necessary to produce the required firing current is  attained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Firing switch. The switch used to initiate the application of  energy to the blasting circuit shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require deliberate action for its operation to prevent  accidental firing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operate only when the voltage necessary to produce the required  firing current is available to the blasting circuit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Firing line terminals. The terminals used to connect the  blasting circuit to the blasting unit shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a secure, low-resistance connection to the blasting  circuit as demonstrated by the firing line terminals test in Sec. 7.68;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be corrosion-resistant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be insulated to protect the user from electrical shock; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be separated from each other by an insulated barrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ratings of electric components. No electric component of the  blasting unit, other than batteries, shall be operated at more than 90  percent of any of its electrical ratings in the normal operation of the  blasting unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-incendive electric contacts. In the normal operation of a  blasting unit, the electric energy discharged by making and breaking  electric contacts shall not be capable of igniting a methane-air  atmosphere, as determined by the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The electric current through an electric contact shall not be  greater than that determined from Figure D-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum voltage that can be applied across an electric  contact that discharges a capacitor shall not be greater than that  determined from Figure D-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The electric current through an electric contact that interrupts  a circuit containing inductive components shall not be greater than that  determined from Figure D-3. Inductive components include inductors,  chokes, relay coils, motors, transformers, and similar electric  components that have an inductance greater than 100 microhenries. No  inductive component in a circuit with making and breaking electric  contacts shall have an inductance value greater than 100 millihenries.

In the normal operation of the blasting  unit, the maximum temperature of any electric component shall not exceed  302 [deg]F (150 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Capacitor discharge. The blasting unit shall include an  automatic means   to dissipate any electric charge remaining in any capacitor after the  blasting unit is deenergized and not in use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Construction. Blasting units shall meet the acceptable  performance criteria of the construction test of Sec. 7.67.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Locking device. The blasting unit shall be equipped with a  locking device to prevent unauthorized use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Enclosure. The blasting unit enclosure shall be protected  against tampering by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sealing the enclosure, except the battery compartment, using  continuous welding, brazing, soldering, or equivalent methods; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sealing the electric components, other than batteries, in a  solidified insulating material and assembling the enclosure with tamper- resistant hardware.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Battery charging. Blasting units that contain rechargeable  batteries shall have the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A blocking diode, or equivalent device, in series with the  battery to prevent electric energy in the battery from being available  at the charging connector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The charging connector recessed into the enclosure.</p>
