In areas administered by the NPS or the FWS, a permit shall be obtained from the appropriate agency prior to engaging in any preapplication activities. Prior to approval and issuance of such a permit, the appropriate Federal agencies must find that the proposed preapplication activity is compatible with the purposes for which the area was established.</p>
