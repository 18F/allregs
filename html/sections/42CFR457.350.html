For individuals identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under Sec.  457.340(d) of this subpart, transfer the individual's electronic account to the Medicaid agency via a secure electronic interface; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in Sec.  457.355 of this subpart, find the applicant ineligible, provisionally ineligible, or suspend the applicant's application for CHIP unless and until the Medicaid application for the applicant is denied; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine or redetermine eligibility for CHIP, consistent with the timeliness standards established under Sec.  457.340(d) of this subpart, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State is notified, in accordance with Sec.  435.1200(d)(5) of this chapter that the applicant has been found ineligible for Medicaid; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State is notified prior to the final Medicaid eligibility determination that the applicant's circumstances have changed and another screening shows that the applicant is no longer potentially eligible for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Informed application decisions. To enable a family to make an informed decision about applying for Medicaid or completing the Medicaid application process, a State must provide the child's family with information, in writing, about--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State's Medicaid program, including the benefits covered, and restrictions on cost sharing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility rules that prohibit children who have been screened eligible for Medicaid from being enrolled in a separate child health program, other than provisional temporary enrollment while a final Medicaid eligibility determination is being made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State will determine the written format and timing of the information regarding Medicaid eligibility,

benefits, and the application process required under this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Waiting lists, enrollment caps and closed enrollment. The State must establish procedures to ensure that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The procedures developed in accordance with this section have been followed for each child applying for a separate child health program before placing the child on a waiting list or otherwise deferring action on the child's application for the separate child health program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Families are informed that a child may be eligible for Medicaid if circumstances change while the child is on a waiting list for separate child health program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Applicants found potentially eligible for other insurance affordability programs. For individuals identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, including during a period of uninsurance imposed by the state under Sec.  457.805, the state must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under Sec.  457.340(d), transfer the electronic account to the applicable program via a secure electronic interfaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of individuals subject to a period of uninsurance under this part, the state must notify such program of the date on which such period ends and the individual is eligible to enroll in CHIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Applicants potentially eligible for Medicaid on a basis other than modified adjusted gross income. For individuals identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under Sec.  457.340(d) of this subpart, transfer the electronic account to the Medicaid agency via a secure electronic interface;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete the determination of eligibility for CHIP in accordance with Sec.  457.340 of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disenroll the enrollee from CHIP if the State is notified in accordance with Sec.  435.1200(d)(5) of this chapter that the applicant has been determined eligible for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A State may enter into an arrangement with the Exchange for the entity that determines eligibility for CHIP to make determinations of eligibility for advanced premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions, consistent with 45 CFR 155.110(a)(2).
