                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptance of proposed consent agreement. The Commission may  accept or refuse to accept a proposed consent agreement. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, acceptance does not  constitute final approval, but it serves as the basis for further  actions leading to final disposition of the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effectiveness of hold-separate or asset-maintenance order.  Following acceptance of a consent agreement, the Commission will, if it  deems a hold-separate or asset-maintenance order appropriate, issue a  complaint and such an order as agreed to by the parties. Such order will  be final upon service. The issuance of a complaint under this paragraph  will neither commence an adjudicatory proceeding subject to part 3 of  this chapter nor subject the consent agreement proceeding to the  prohibitions specified in Sec. 4.7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public comment. Promptly after its acceptance of the consent  agreement, the Commission will place the order contained in the consent  agreement, the complaint, and the consent agreement on the public record  for a period of 30 days, or such other period as the Commission may  specify, for the receipt of comments or views from any interested  person. At the same time, the Commission will place on the public record  an explanation of the provisions of the order and the relief to be  obtained thereby and any other information that it believes may help  interested persons understand the order. The Commission also will  publish the explanation in the Federal Register. The Commission retains  the discretion to issue a complaint and a Final Decision and Order,  incorporating the order contained in a consent agreement, in appropriate  cases before seeking public comment. Unless directed otherwise by the  Commission, such Decision and Order will be final upon service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Comment on initial compliance report. If respondents have filed  an initial report of compliance pursuant to Sec. 2.33, the Commission  will place that report on the public record, except for portions, if  any, granted confidential treatment pursuant to Sec. 4.9(c) of this  chapter, with the complaint, the order, and the consent agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Action following comment period. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the comment  period, on the basis of comments received or otherwise, the Commission  may either withdraw its acceptance of the agreement and so notify  respondents, in which event it will take such other action as it may  consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint in such form as  the circumstances may require and its decision in disposition of the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission, following the comment period, may determine, on  the basis of the comments or otherwise, that a Final Decision and Order  that was issued in advance of the comment period should be modified.  Absent agreement by respondents to the modifications, the Commission may  initiate a proceeding to reopen and modify the decision and order in  accordance with Sec. 3.72(b) of this chapter or commence a new  administrative proceeding by issuing a complaint in accordance with  Sec. 3.11 of this chapter.
