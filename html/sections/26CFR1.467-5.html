The exceptions in this paragraph (a)(2) do not apply to rental agreements subject to constant rental accrual under Sec. 1.467-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Variable rate treated as fixed--(1) In general.

The variable interest adjustment amount is not taken into account in determining the principal balance of a section 467 loan under Sec. 1.467-4(b). Instead, the section 467 loan balance is computed as if all amounts payable under the section 467 rental agreement were based on the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X and Y enter into a section 467 rental agreement for the lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to 2000, $200,000 to 2001, and $100,000 to 2002, and requires the lessee to pay all $400,000 of rent on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement requires the accrual of interest on unpaid accrued rent at two different qualified floating rates (as defined in Sec. 1.1275-5(b)), one for 2001 and the other for 2002, such interest to be

paid on December 31 of the year it accrues. The rental agreement provides that the qualified floating rate is set at a current value within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-5(a)(4). Assume that on the agreement date, 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually. Assume also that the agreement is not a leaseback or long-term agreement and, therefore, is not subject to constant rental accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine if the section 467 rental agreement provides for adequate interest under Sec. 1.467-2(b), Sec. 1.467-2(b)(2) requires the use of fixed rate substitutes (in this example determined in the same manner as under Sec. 1.1275-5(e)(3)(i) treating the agreement date as the issue date) in place of the variable rates called for by the rental agreement. Assume that on the agreement date the qualified floating rates, and therefore the fixed rate substitutes, relating to 2001 and 2002 are 10 and 15 percent compounded annually. Taking into account the fixed rate substitutes, the sum of the present values of all amounts payable by the lessee as fixed rent and interest thereon is greater than the sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each rental period. Accordingly, the rental agreement provides adequate interest under Sec. 1.467-2(b)(1)(iii) and the fixed rent accruing in each calendar year during the rental agreement is the fixed rent allocated under the rental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the section 467 rental agreement provides for variable interest on unpaid accrued fixed rent at qualified floating rates and the qualified floating rates are set at a current value, the requirements of Sec. 1.1275-5(a)(3)(i)(A) and (4) are met and the rental agreement provides for variable interest within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield of the section 467 loan is computed based on the fixed rate substitutes. Under Sec. 1.467-4(c), the constant yield (rounded to two decimal places) equals 13.63 percent compounded annually. Based on the fixed rate substitutes, the fixed rent, interest on fixed rent, and the principal balance of the section 467 loan, for each calendar year during the lease term, are as follows:

Assume that the variable rates for 2001 and 2002 are actually 11 and 14 percent, respectively. Without regard to section 467, the interest that would have accrued during each calendar year under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement, and the interest that would have accrued under the terms of the rental agreement using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are as follows:

Thus, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the actual interest on fixed rent for 2001 is $14,630 ($13,630 + $1,000) and for 2002 is $38,370 ($41,370-$3,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 15 percent compounded annually and the section 467 rental agreement does not provide adequate interest under Sec. 1.467-2(b). Consequently, the fixed rent for each calendar year during the lease is the proportional rental amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the present values of the fixed rent provided for each calendar year during the lease term, discounted at 15 percent compounded annually, equals $303,936.87.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires the proportional rental amount to be computed based on the assumption that interest will accrue and be paid based on the fixed rate substitutes. Thus, the sum of the present values of the projected payments under the section 467 rental agreement equals $300,156.16, computed as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY99.005</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires the proportional rental amount to be computed based on the assumption that interest will accrue and be paid based on the fixed rate substitutes.
