If you are not in compliance, you may still be eligible for draws if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> SBA determines that your outstanding violations are of non-substantive provisions of the Act or regulations or your Participation Agreement and that you have not repeatedly violated any non-substantive provisions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You have agreed with SBA on a course of action to resolve your violations and such agreement does not prevent you from issuing Leverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for funding draws.

With each request, submit the following documentation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement certifying that there has been no material adverse change in your financial condition since your last filing of SBA Form 468 (see also Sec. 108.1220 for SBA Form 468 filing requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If your request is submitted more than 30 days following the end of your fiscal year, but before you have submitted your annual filing of SBA Form 468 (Long Form) in accordance with Sec. 108.630(a), a preliminary unaudited annual financial statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A statement certifying that to the best of your knowledge and belief, you are in compliance with all provisions of the Act and SBA regulations (i.e., no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations) and your Participation Agreement, or a statement listing any specific violations you are aware of. Either statement must be executed by one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An officer of the NMVC Company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An officer of a corporate general partner of the NMVC Company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An individual who is authorized to act as or for a general partner of the NMVC Company; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An individual who is authorized to act as or for a member-manager of the NMVC Company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund one or more particular Small Businesses or to provide liquidity for your operations.

(1) Within 30 calendar days after the actual closing date of each Financing funded with the proceeds of your draw, you must file an SBA Form 1031 confirming the closing of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If SBA required you to provide information concerning a specific planned Financing under paragraph

(d)(4) of this section, and such Financing has not closed within 60 calendar days after the anticipated closing date, you must give SBA a written explanation of the failure to close.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you do not comply with this paragraph (e), you will not be eligible for additional draws. SBA may also determine that you are not in compliance with the terms of your Leverage under Sec. 108.1810.</p>
