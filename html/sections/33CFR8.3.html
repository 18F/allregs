There, Reservists perform the same duties and have the same responsibilities as their active duty counterparts. Their integrated work prepares Reservists to perform the duties of their mobilization assignments while at the same time providing assistance to the active service. Some Reservists are assigned to dedicated Reserve units where they train and mobilize in support of national defense operations.
