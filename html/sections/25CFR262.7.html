                                Sec. 262.7  Notice to Indian tribes of possible harm to cultural or religious sites.

                            <p class="depth0">When consent by an Indian tribe to proposed excavation or removal of  archaeological resources from Indian lands it owns or over which it has  jurisdiction contains all of the information written as prescribed and  advised in Sec. 262.5(c)(1), it may be taken to mean that subject to  such terms and conditions as the tribe might specify, issuance of a  permit for the proposed work will not result in harm to, or destruction  of, any site of religious or cultural importance. No further  notification is necessary, unless the Area Director has reason to  believe that the proposed work might harm or destroy a site of religious  or cultural importance to another tribe or Native American group. He or  she shall then follow the notification procedures at 43 CFR 7.7. Those  procedures must also be followed when proposed work might affect lands  of Indian individuals over which there is no tribal jurisdiction or  public lands owned or administered by the BIA.</p>
