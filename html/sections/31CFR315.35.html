Payment of a savings bond will be made to the person or  persons entitled under the provisions of these regulations, except that  checks in payment will not be delivered to addresses in areas with  respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates  the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States. See  Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR  part 211). Payment will be made without regard to any notice of   adverse claims to a bond and no notification of stoppage or caveat  against payment of a bond will be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Series A, B, C, D, F, and J. A bond of Series A, B, C, D, F, or  J will be paid at face value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Series E and Savings Notes.
