                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the training and assessment of competence required by this  part are not subject to Coast Guard approval under Secs. 10.402 and  10.407 of this subpart, but are used to qualify a mariner to hold an  endorsement, the offeror of the course or program must ensure that such  training and assessment meets the same standards as those found in  Secs. 10.402 and 10.403 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Coast Guard will accept courses approved and monitored by a  Coast Guard-accepted Quality Standard System (QSS) organization. The  Coast Guard maintains a list of training organizations conducting  accepted training that are independently monitored by a Coast Guard- accepted QSS organization. The Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization  must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a certificate of acceptance of training to the Coast  Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit an updated certificate of acceptance to the Coast Guard  if the terms of acceptance have been changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sign each certificate to the training organization owner or  operator, or its authorized representative(s), stating that the training  fully complies with the requirements of this section, and identifying  the Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization being used for independent  monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The training must be audited periodically in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 10.409(e)(7) of this subpart. If the Coast Guard  determines, on the basis of its own observations or conclusions or those  of the Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization, that the particular  training does not satisfy one or more of the conditions described in  paragraph (a) of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Coast Guard or Coast Guard-accepted QSS organization will so  notify the offeror of the training by letter, enclosing a report of the  observations and conclusions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The offeror may, within a period of time specified in the  notice, either appeal the observations or conclusions to the Commandant  (CG-CVC) or bring the training into compliance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the appeal is denied--or if the deficiency is not corrected  in the allotted time, or within any additional time period judged by the  Coast Guard to be appropriate, considering progress toward compliance-- the Coast Guard will remove the training from the list maintained under  paragraph (b) of this section until it can verify full compliance. The  Coast Guard may deny applications for endorsements based, in whole or in  part, on training not on the list, until additional training or  assessment is documented.</p>
