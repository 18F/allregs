                            <p class="depth0">It is the responsibility of the Regional Counsel to assure the protection of the veteran, his or her beneficiaries, and their estates in State court proceedings involving commitment and restoration, and the appointment of fiduciaries. To this end certain expenses such as court costs, publication fees, recording fees, transportation expenses and fees for medical testimony may be authorized by the Regional Counsel. Payment of these costs will be borne by the administration concerned. However, every effort will be made by the Regional Counsel to avoid having these costs imposed on the Department of Veterans Affairs. The travel and per diem cost of the Regional Counsel personnel will be borne by the Regional Counsel.</p>
