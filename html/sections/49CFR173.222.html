Each package must conform to the packaging requirements of subpart B of this part, except for the requirements in Secs. 173.24(a)(1) and 173.27(e), and the following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the machinery or apparatus contains more than one hazardous material, the materials must not be capable of reacting dangerously together.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The nature of the containment must be as follows--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Damage to the receptacles containing the hazardous materials during transport is unlikely. However, in the event of damage to the receptacles containing the hazardous materials, no leakage of the hazardous materials from the machinery or apparatus is possible. A leakproof liner may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receptacles containing hazardous materials must be secured and cushioned so as to prevent their breakage or leakage and so as to control their movement within the machinery or apparatus during normal conditions of transportation. Cushioning material must not react dangerously with the content of the receptacles. Any leakage of the contents must not substantially impair the protective properties of the cushioning material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Receptacles for gases, their contents and filling densities must conform to the applicable requirements of

this subchapter, unless otherwise approved by the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total net quantity of hazardous materials contained in one item of machinery or apparatus must not exceed the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 1 kg (2.2 pounds) in the case of solids;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 0.5 L (0.1 gallons) in the case of liquids;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 0.5 kg (1.1 pounds) in the case of Division 2.2 gases.
