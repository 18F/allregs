                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in Secs. 421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the Secretary or by CMS, such as reassignment of providers, offer of a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with respect to a specific provider or class of providers, CMS may reassign that provider or class of providers to another intermediary in accordance with Sec. 421.114.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the intermediary to meet its

contractual requirements exceeds the amount which CMS finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for adverse action.
