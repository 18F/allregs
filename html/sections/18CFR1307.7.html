                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with this part and compliance with such standards for construction and alteration of facilities as TVA may provide. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or the transferee in the case of a subsequent transfer, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient during the period for which ownership or possession of the property is retained. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreement, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired with TVA financial assistance, or in the case where financial assistance was provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a convenant running with the land assuring compliance with this part and the guidelines contained herein for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the TVA financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with of TVA financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
