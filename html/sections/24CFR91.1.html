                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overall goals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overall goal of the community planning  and development programs covered by this part is to develop viable urban  communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living  environment and expanding economic opportunities principally for low-  and moderate-income persons. The primary means towards this end is to  extend and strengthen partnerships among all levels of government and  the private sector, including for-profit and non-profit organizations,  in the production and operation of affordable housing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Decent housing includes assisting homeless persons to obtain  appropriate housing and assisting persons at risk of becoming homeless;  retention of the affordable housing stock; and increasing the  availability of permanent housing in standard condition and affordable  cost to low-income and moderate-income families, particularly to members  of disadvantaged minorities, without discrimination on the basis of  race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or  disability. Decent housing also includes increasing the supply of  supportive housing, which combines structural features and services  needed to enable persons with special needs, including persons with HIV/ AIDS and their families, to live with dignity and independence; and  providing housing affordable to low-income persons accessible to job  opportunities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A suitable living environment includes improving the safety and  livability of neighborhoods; increasing access to quality public and  private facilities and services; reducing the isolation of income groups  within a community or geographical area through the spatial  deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income and  the revitalization of deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods;  restoring and preserving properties of special historic, architectural,  or aesthetic value; and conservation of energy resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expanded economic opportunities includes job creation and  retention; establishment, stabilization and expansion of small  businesses (including microbusinesses); the provision of public services  concerned with employment; the provision of jobs involved in carrying  out activities under programs covered by this plan to low-income persons  living in areas affected by those programs and activities; availability  of mortgage financing for low-income persons at reasonable rates using  nondiscriminatory lending practices; access to capital and credit for  development activities that promote the long-term economic and social  viability of the community; and empowerment and self-sufficiency  opportunities for low-income persons to reduce generational poverty in  federally assisted and public housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consolidated submission described in this part 91 requires  the jurisdiction to state in one document its plan to pursue these goals  for all the community planning and development programs, as well as for  housing programs. It is these goals against which the plan and the  jurisdiction's performance under the plan will be evaluated by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Functions of plan. The consolidated plan serves the following  functions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A planning document for the jurisdiction, which builds on a  participatory process among citizens, organizations, businesses, and  other stakeholders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A submission for federal funds under HUD's formula grant  programs for jurisdictions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A strategy to be followed in carrying out HUD programs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A management tool for assessing performance and tracking  results.
