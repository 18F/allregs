                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulated nursery stock may not be moved interstate from a  quarantined area unless such movement is authorized in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Kumquat (Fortunella spp.) plants, with or without fruit  attached, may be moved interstate from a quarantined area into any area  of the United States except commercial citrus-producing areas if all of  the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plants are own-root-only and have not been grafted or  budded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plants are started, are grown, and have been maintained  solely at the nursery from which they will be moved interstate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the plants are not grown from seed, then the cuttings used  for propagation of the plants are taken from plants located on the same  nursery premises or from another nursery that is eligible to produce  kumquat plants for interstate movement under the requirements of this  paragraph (b). Cuttings may not be obtained from properties where citrus  canker is present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All citrus plants at the nursery premises have undergone State  inspection and have been found to be free of citrus canker no less than  three times. The inspections must be at intervals of 30 to 45 days, with  the most recent inspection being within 30 days of the date on which the  plants are removed and packed for shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All vehicles, equipment, and other articles used in providing  inspection, maintenance, or related services in the nursery must be  treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter before entering the  nursery to prevent the introduction of citrus canker. All personnel who  enter the nursery to provide these services must be treated in  accordance with part 305 of this chapter before entering the nursery to  prevent the introduction of citrus canker.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If citrus canker is found in the nursery, all regulated plants  and plant material must be removed from the nursery and all areas of the  nursery's facilities where plants are grown and all associated equipment  and tools used at the nursery must be treated in accordance with part  305 of this chapter in order for the nursery to be eligible to produce  kumquat plants to be moved interstate under this paragraph (b). Fifteen  days after these actions are completed, the nursery may receive new  kumquat seed or cuttings from a nursery that is eligible to produce  kumquat plants for interstate movement under this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The plants, except for plants that are hermetically sealed in  plastic bags before leaving the nursery, are completely enclosed in  containers or vehicle compartments during movement through the  quarantined area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The kumquat plants or trees are accompanied by a limited permit  issued in accordance with Sec. 301.75-12. The statement ``Limited  permit: Not for distribution in AZ, CA, HI, LA, TX, and American Samoa,  Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands of the  United States'' must be displayed on a plastic or metal tag attached to  each plant, or on the box or container if the plant is sealed in  plastic. In addition, this statement must be displayed on the outside of  any shipping containers used to transport these plants, and the limited  permit must be attached to the bill of lading or other shipping document  that accompanies the plants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulated nursery stock produced in a nursery within a  quarantined area may be moved interstate to any area within the United  States, if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nursery in which the nursery stock is produced has entered  into a compliance agreement in which it agrees to meet the relevant  construction standards, sourcing and certification requirements,  cleaning, disinfecting, and safeguarding requirements, labeling  requirements, and recordkeeping and inspection requirements specified in  a PPQ protocol document. The protocol document will be provided to the  person at the time he or she enters into the compliance agreement.\1\  The compliance agreement may also specify additional conditions  determined by APHIS to be necessary in order to prevent the  dissemination of citrus canker under which the nursery stock must be  grown, maintained, and shipped in order to obtain a certificate for its  movement. The compliance agreement will also specify that APHIS may  amend the agreement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ The protocol document is also available on the Internet at  http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus/ index.shtml and may be obtained from local Plant Protection and  Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An inspector has determined that the nursery has adhered to all  terms and conditions of the compliance agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The nursery stock is accompanied by a certificate issued in  accordance with Sec. 301.75-12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The nursery stock is completely enclosed in a sealed container  that is clearly labeled with the certificate and is moved interstate in  that container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the certificate is attached to the consignee's copy of  the accompanying waybill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regulated nursery stock produced in a nursery located in a  quarantined area that is not eligible for movement under paragraph (b)  or paragraph (c) of this section may be moved interstate only for  immediate export. The regulated nursery stock must be accompanied by a  limited permit issued in accordance with Sec. 301.75-12 and must be  moved in a container sealed by APHIS directly to the port of export in  accordance with the conditions of the limited permit.
