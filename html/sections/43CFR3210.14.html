Once BLM and the surface managing agency reach  agreement and the surface managing agency approves the proposed  readjustment, we will follow the procedures in paragraphs (c), (d), and  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BLM may readjust your lease rentals and royalties at not less  than 20-year intervals beginning 35 years after we determine that your  lease is producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities. BLM  will not increase your rentals or royalties by more than 50 percent over  the rental or royalties you paid before the readjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BLM will give you a written proposal to readjust the rentals,  royalties, or other terms and conditions of your lease. You will have 30  days after you receive the proposal to file with BLM an objection in  writing to the proposed new terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you do not object in writing or relinquish your lease, you  will conclusively be deemed to have agreed to the proposed new terms and  conditions. BLM will issue a written decision setting the date that the  new terms and conditions become effective as part of   your lease. This decision will be in full force and effect under its own  terms, and you are not authorized to appeal the BLM decision to the  Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you file a timely objection in writing, BLM may issue a  written decision making the readjusted terms and conditions effective no  sooner than 90 days after we receive your objections, unless we reach an  agreement with you as to the readjusted terms and conditions of your  lease that makes them effective sooner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If BLM does not reach an agreement with you by 60 days after we  receive your objections, then either the lessee or BLM may terminate  your lease, upon giving the other party 30 days' notice in writing. A  termination under this paragraph does not affect your obligations that  accrued under the lease when it was in effect, including those specified  in Sec. 3200.4.</p>
