Any person subject to the requirements of this part who previously has complied with reporting requirements of a rule under TSCA section 8(a) by submitting the information described in Sec. 711.15 for a chemical substance described in Sec. 711.5 to EPA, and has done so within 1 year of the start of a submission period described in Sec. 711.20, is not required to report again on the manufacture of that chemical substance at that site during that submission period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With regard to importers. This part requires that only one report be submitted on each import transaction involving a chemical substance described in Sec. 711.5. When two or more persons are involved in a particular import transaction and each person meets the Agency's definition of ``importer'' as set forth in 40 CFR 704.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report; if no report is submitted as required under this part, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Toll manufacturers and persons contracting with a toll manufacturer. This part requires that only one report per site be submitted on each chemical substance described in Sec. 711.5. When a company contracts with a toll manufacturer to manufacture a chemical substance, and each party meets the Agency's definition of ``manufacturer'' as set forth in Sec. 711.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report for that site. However, both the contracting company and the toll manufacturer are liable if no report is made.</p>
