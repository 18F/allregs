You must also notify the employee of the  procedures for requesting a test of the split specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must inform the employee that he or she has 72 hours from  the time you provide this notification to him or her to request a test  of the split specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must tell the employee how to contact you to make this  request. You must provide telephone numbers or other information that  will allow the employee to make this request. As the MRO, you must have  the ability to receive the employee's calls at all times during the 72  hour period (e.g., by use of an answering machine with a ``time stamp''  feature when there is no one in your office to answer the phone).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must tell the employee that if he or she makes this request  within 72 hours, the employer must ensure that the test takes place, and  that the employee is not required to pay for the test from his or her  own funds before the test takes place.
