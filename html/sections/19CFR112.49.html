                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issuance. When an identification card is required by the port  director under Sec. 112.41, and the port director determines that the  application for the identification card cannot be administratively  processed in a reasonable period of time, any licensed cartman or  lighterman may upon written request have a temporary identification card  issued by the port director to his employee if he can show to the  satisfaction of the port director that a hardship to his business would  result pending issuance of an identification card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Validity and renewal. The temporary identification card shall be  valid for a period of 60 days. The port director may renew the temporary  identification card for additional 30-day periods if he feels that the  circumstances under which the temporary identification card was  originally issued continue to exist. The temporary identification card  shall be returned by the holder or licensee to the   port director when the identification card is issued or the privileges  granted thereby are withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal of temporary card. The temporary identification card  may be withdrawn at any time if in the judgment of the port director  continuation of the privileges granted thereby would endanger the  revenue or if the holder of the temporary identification card refuses or  neglects to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs  order, rule, or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bond. The licensed cartman or lighterman shall as a condition  precedent to the issuance of a temporary identification card to his  employee be required to post a bond in a penal sum, the amount to be  determined by the port director, to guarantee return of the temporary  identification card by the holder upon its withdrawal or upon issuance  of a permanent identification card and to cover any loss or damage  caused to the United States by the holder of the temporary  identification card. The bond shall be on Customs Form 301 and contain  the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.63 of this chapter and be in  such amount as determined by the port director.
