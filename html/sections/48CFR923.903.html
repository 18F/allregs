                            <p class="depth0">The FAR Environmental Management Systems clause at 52.223-XX should be used in contracts where the contractor operates a DOE site or portion thereof. Some DOE sites have a single Environmental Management System for the site while others have separate Environmental Management Systems for various portions of the site which may be operated by different contractors. Check with local environmental management personnel regarding the applicability of the FAR 52.223-XX clause to a specific contract.

923.7003  Contract clauses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A decision to include or not include environmental, safety and health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer in consultation with appropriate Office of Health, Safety and Security personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When work is to be performed at a facility where the DOE will exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, shall be used in such contract or subcontract if conditions (b)(1) through (3), are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's other work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety and health services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The facility is government-owned, or leased by or for the account of the government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and which are a production or utilization facility where there is use or possession of source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials, DOE policy is not to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract but rather to rely upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing requirements (including agreements with States under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act). Pursuant to this policy, neither the clause found at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, is to be incorporated in the contracts or subcontracts for work at such facilities. Notwithstanding this general policy with respect to facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary or his designee may determine in special cases, that DOE needs to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract (see paragraph (d) of this section). When such a determination is made, the

clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract or subcontract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and where there is a machine capable of producing ionizing radiation, it is DOE policy not to regulate such activity where it is adequately regulated by a State or other Federal agency. In such cases, neither clause 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be incorporated in the contract. Where the contracting officer, with appropriate environmental, safety and health advice determines that no State or other Federal agency exists to adequately regulate the operation and/or use of such machines, the clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract. The Assistant Secretary for Health, Safety and Security (or designee) shall be consulted to determine if a non-agreement State or a facility located in a non-agreement State has been reviewed by any other DOE office to establish that the State agency has the essential authority and resources for enforcing the radiation protection standards. This is to assure reasonable consistency in the assessment of radiation protection in non-agreement States and subsequent use of 952.223-72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In a situation where the contractor or subcontractor is performing DOE work at more than one location, inclusion of either, or both, 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, and 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, may be appropriate. In such cases, the contract or subcontract must include language to specify the extent of applicability of each clause used. For example, with a parenthetical: (Applicable only to work performed at a contractor site which has 952.223-71 or 952.223-72 clause in its contract or subcontract).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Except as prescribed in 970.1504-8(c), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit--Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that contain both the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, and the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Except as prescribed in 970.1504-8(c), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-77, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit--Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that do not contain the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, but that do contain the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-75, Preservation of Individual Occupational Radiation Exposure Records, in contracts containing 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, or 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality.
