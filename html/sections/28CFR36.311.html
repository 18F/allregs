                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of wheelchairs and manually-powered mobility aids. A public  accommodation shall permit individuals with mobility disabilities to use  wheelchairs and manually-powered mobility aids, such as walkers,  crutches, canes,   braces, or other similar devices designed for use by individuals with  mobility disabilities in any areas open to pedestrian use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of other power-driven mobility devices. A public  accommodation shall make reasonable modifications in its policies,  practices, or procedures to permit the use of other power-driven  mobility devices by individuals with mobility disabilities, unless the  public accommodation can demonstrate that the class of other power- driven mobility devices cannot be operated in accordance with legitimate  safety requirements that the public accommodation has adopted pursuant  to Sec.  36.301(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assessment factors. In determining whether a particular other  power-driven mobility device can be allowed in a specific facility as a  reasonable modification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a public  accommodation shall consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The type, size, weight, dimensions, and speed of the device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The facility's volume of pedestrian traffic (which may vary at  different times of the day, week, month, or year);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The facility's design and operational characteristics (e.g.,  whether its business is conducted indoors, its square footage, the  density and placement of stationary devices, and the availability of  storage for the device, if requested by the user);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether legitimate safety requirements can be established to  permit the safe operation of the other power-driven mobility device in  the specific facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the use of the other power-driven mobility device  creates a substantial risk of serious harm to the immediate environment  or natural or cultural resources, or poses a conflict with Federal land  management laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inquiry about disability. A public accommodation shall not  ask an individual using a wheelchair or other power-driven mobility  device questions about the nature and extent of the individual's  disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inquiry into use of other power-driven mobility device. A public  accommodation may ask a person using an other power-driven mobility  device to provide a credible assurance that the mobility device is  required because of the person's disability. A public accommodation that  permits the use of an other power-driven mobility device by an  individual with a mobility disability shall accept the presentation of a  valid, State-issued disability parking placard or card, or State-issued  proof of disability, as a credible assurance that the use of the other  power-driven mobility device is for the individual's mobility  disability. In lieu of a valid, State-issued disability parking placard  or card, or State-issued proof of disability, a public accommodation  shall accept as a credible assurance a verbal representation, not  contradicted by observable fact, that the other power-driven mobility  device is being used for a mobility disability. A ``valid'' disability  placard or card is one that is presented by the individual to whom it  was issued and is otherwise in compliance with the State of issuance's  requirements for disability placards or cards.  [AG Order No. 3181-2010, 75 FR 56255, Sept. 15, 2010]    Sec. Sec.  36.312-36.399  [Reserved]</p>
