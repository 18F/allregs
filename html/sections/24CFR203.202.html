                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For a Plan to be acceptable to HUD, it must assure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a builder, for any reason, fails to correct structural defects or construction deficiencies in a property covered by an insured 10-year protection Plan during the term of any warranty offered by the builder on the property, the Plan issuer will effect the corrections in accordance with the terms of the Plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Plan issuer, for any reason, fails to effect correction of these deficiencies or defects, or otherwise fails to honor the terms of its coverage, its insurance backer or, if the Plan issuer is an insurance company, the insurance company itself, will effect the corrections or otherwise honor the terms of the Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In evaluating applications for renewal of Plan acceptance, HUD will take into consideration such reliable evidence, as is made available to the Department, of a Plan issuer's failure to fulfill its obligations. Where HUD has credible evidence of a Plan issuer's failure to correct covered homeowner problems, or there are justifiable homeowner complaints about untimely problem resolution by a Plan issuer, HUD will consider this as cause for termination of a Plan's acceptance and as grounds for initiation of sanctions against a Plan issuer or insurance backer, in accordance with 2 CFR part 2424. If HUD proposes to terminate a Plan's acceptance, the issuer of the Plan will be advised of the reason therefore, and the procedural safeguards of 2 CFR part 2424 will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless renewed, Plan acceptance by HUD expires automatically on the second anniversary date of acceptance. The Plan issuer must apply for acceptance renewal at least two months, but no more than three months, in advance of expiration to avoid automatic acceptance termination. Prior acceptance of a Plan will be continued beyond the date of automatic acceptance termination only by a written notification to the Plan issuer and only if the delay is caused by a lack of timely HUD processing of a renewal application. HUD will not extend the expiration date of a prior Plan acceptance if the Plan issuer has negligently provided incomplete information with its renewal application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After a Plan has been accepted by HUD, there shall be no change in, or modification to, its provisions, or in its insurance backers or insurance contract(s), without prior written HUD acceptance of such change or modification, except that changes mandated by other applicable laws may not require HUD's prior approval. A violation of this condition may be cause for termination of a Plan's acceptance, and may be grounds for initiation of sanctions against the Plan issuer, in accordance

with 2 CFR part 2424. Insofar as practicable, HUD will respond to a Plan issuer's request for acceptance of a change within 30 days of receipt of the request. Plan acceptance by HUD will be for a two-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requests for initial HUD acceptance or renewal of acceptance of a Plan should be made to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Requests must be accompanied by information and documentation evidencing Plan compliance with Sec. 203.204. Acceptability of Plans will be determined by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing who will notify applicants of his or her determination. If a Plan is rejected, the applicant will be advised of the reason for rejection. The applicant may appeal the rejection to the Assistant Secretary for Housing, at the above address, stating specifically why the Plan should be approved. The Assistant Secretary (whose decision is final) will, within a reasonable time, advise the applicant whether the rejection will be upheld or reversed. Each HUD field office will be advised of Plans determined to be acceptable, or Plans that have been rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Existing Plans will be allowed a grace period of 9 months commencing from November 6, 1990 to make the necessary adjustments to comply with the provisions and requirements of Sec. 203.200 to Sec. 203.209.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each Plan issuer must submit a written certification addressed to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, no later than three weeks before the anniversary date of the Plan's acceptance by HUD, that the insurance company backing its Plan is still an insurance carrier approved by the State insurance commission (or the equivalent entity) in each jurisdiction in which the Plan is offered, or is still a Risk Retention Group meeting the criteria of Sec. 203.208 of this part.
