                            <p class="depth0">Medicare Part A pays for posthospital SNF care furnished by an SNF,  or a hospital or CAH with a swing-bed approval, only if the  certification and recertification for services are consistent with the  content of paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Content of certification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. Posthospital  SNF care is or was required because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual needs or needed on a daily basis skilled nursing  care (furnished directly by or requiring the supervision of skilled  nursing personnel) or other skilled rehabilitation services that, as a  practical matter, can only be provided in an SNF or a swing-bed hospital  on an inpatient basis, and the SNF care is or was needed for a condition  for which the individual received inpatient care in a participating  hospital or a qualified hospital, as defined in Sec. 409.3 of this  chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual has been correctly assigned to one of the  Resource Utilization Groups designated as representing the required  level of care, as provided in Sec. 409.30 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special requirement for certifications performed prior to July  1, 2002: A swing-bed hospital with more than 49 beds (but fewer than  100) that does not transfer a swing-bed patient to a SNF within 5 days  of the availability date. Transfer of the extended care patient to the  SNF is not medically appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing of certification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The certification  must be obtained at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is  reasonable and practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for certain swing-bed hospitals. For swing-bed  hospitals with more than 49 beds that are approved after March 31, 1988,  the extended care patient's physician has 5 days (excluding weekends and  holidays) beginning on the availability date as defined in  Sec. 413.114(b), to certify that the transfer of the extended care  patient is not medically appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Content of recertifications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The reasons for the continued  need for posthopsital SNF care:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The estimated time the individual will need to remain in the  SNF;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plans for home care, if any; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If appropriate, the fact that continued services are needed for  a condition that arose after admission to the SNF and while the  individual was still under treatment for the condition for which he or  she had received inpatient hospital services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Timing of recertifications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The first recertification is  required no later than the 14th day of posthospital SNF care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent recertifications are required at least every 30 days  after the first recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Signature. Certification and recertification statements may be  signed by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The physician responsible for the case or, with his or her  authorization, by a physician on the SNF staff or a physician who is  available in case of an emergency and has knowledge of the case; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A physician extender (that is, a nurse practitioner, a clinical  nurse specialist, or a physician assistant as those terms are defined in  section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act) who does not have a direct or indirect  employment relationship with the facility but who is working in  collaboration with a physician. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Collaboration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Collaboration means a process whereby a  physician extender works with a doctor of medicine or osteopathy to  deliver health care services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The services are delivered within the scope of the physician  extender's professional expertise, with medical direction and  appropriate supervision as provided for in guidelines jointly developed  by the physician extender and the physician or other mechanisms defined  by Federal regulations and the law of the State in which the services  are performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Types of employment relationships. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Direct employment  relationship. A direct employment relationship with the facility is one  in which the physician extender meets the common law definition of the  facility's ``employee,'' as specified in Secs. 404.1005, 404.1007, and  404.1009 of title 20 of the regulations. When a physician extender meets  this definition with respect to an entity other than the facility  itself, and that   entity has an agreement with the facility for the provision of nursing  services under Sec. 409.21 of this subchapter, the facility is  considered to have an indirect employment relationship with the  physician extender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Indirect employment relationship. (1) When a physician extender  meets the definition of a direct employment relationship in paragraph  (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to an entity other than the  facility itself, and that entity has an agreement with the facility for  the provision of nursing services under Sec. 409.21 of this subchapter,  the facility is considered to have an indirect employment relationship  with the physician extender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An indirect employment relationship does not exist if the  agreement between the entity and the facility involves only the  performance of delegated physician tasks under Sec. 483.40(e) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recertification requirement fulfilled by utilization review. A  SNF may substitute utilization review of extended stay cases for the  second and subsequent recertifications, if it includes this procedure in  its utilization review plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Description of procedures. The SNF must have available on file a  written description that specifies the certification and recertification  time schedule and indicates whether utilization review is used as an  alternative to the second and subsequent recertifications.
