                                Sec. 102-75.545  What happens if property that was transferred to meet United States for noncompliance with the terms of sale, or other cause?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In each case of repossession under a terminated lease or reversion  of title for noncompliance with the terms or conditions of sale or other  cause, ED or HHS must, prior to repossession or reversion of title,  provide the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office with an  accurate description of the real and related personal property involved  using the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), and the  appropriate schedules. After receiving a statement from ED or HHS that  the property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement  and determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in conjunction with  ED or HHS, determines that the property should be revested, ED or HHS  must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review and act upon the  Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the grantee must provide  protection and maintenance for the property until the title reverts to  the Federal Government, including the period of any notice of intent to  revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to  the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property  Disposal.</p><p class="depth0">Property for Providing Self-Help Housing or Housing Assistance</p>
