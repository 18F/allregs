                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart codifies and implements requirements for the  national Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program under section 1452  of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in 1996. It applies to States  (i.e., each of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) which  receive capitalization grants and are authorized to establish a Fund  under section 1452. The purpose of this subpart is to ensure that each  State's program is designed and operated in such a manner as to further  the public health protection objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act,  promote the efficient use of all funds, and ensure that the Fund corpus  is available in perpetuity for providing financial assistance to public  water systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart supplements section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water  Act by codifying statutory and program requirements that were published  in the Final Guidelines for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  program (EPA 816-R-97-005) signed by the Assistant Administrator for  Water on February 28, 1997, as well as in subsequent policies. This  subpart also supplements EPA general assistance regulations in 2 CFR  parts 200 and 1500 which contain administrative requirements that apply  to governmental recipients of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  grants and subgrants. EPA will not impose additional major program  requirements without providing an opportunity for affected parties to  comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA intends to implement the national Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund program in a manner that preserves for States a high  degree of flexibility to operate their programs in accordance with each  State's unique needs and circumstances. To the maximum extent  practicable, EPA also intends to administer the financial aspects of the  national Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program in a manner that is  consistent with the policies and procedures of the national Clean Water  State Revolving Fund program established under Title VI of the   Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1381-1387.
