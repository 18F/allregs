                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Competence in the use and handling of pesticides by a private  applicator will be determined by procedures set forth below. State  standards must conform and be at least equal to those prescribed herein.  As a minimum requirement for certification, a private applicator must  show that he possesses a practical knowledge of the pest problems and  pest control practices associated with his agricultural operations;  proper storage, use, handling and disposal of the pesticides and  containers; and his related legal responsibility. This practical  knowledge includes ability to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recognize common pests to be controlled and damage caused by  them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Read and understand the label and labeling information-- including the common name of pesticides he applied; pest(s) to be  controlled, timing and methods of application; safety precautions; any  pre-harvest or re-entry restrictions; and any specific disposal  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Apply pesticides in accordance with label instructions and  warnings, including the ability to prepare the proper concentration of  pesticide to be used under particular circumstances taking into account  such factors as area to be covered, speed at which application equipment  will be driven, and the quantity dispersed in a given period of  operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recognize local environmental situations that must be considered  during application to avoid contamination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recognize poisoning symptoms and procedures to follow in case of  a pesticide accident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such competence of each private applicator shall be verified by  the responsible State agency through the administration of a private  applicator certification system which ensures that the private  applicator is competent, based upon the standards set forth above, to  use the restricted use pesticides under limitations of applicable State  and Federal laws and regulations. A certification system shall employ a  written or oral testing procedure, or such other equivalent system as  may be approved as part of a State plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any case where a person, at the time of testing for  certification, is unable to read a label, the responsible State agency  may employ a testing procedure, previously approved by the  Administrator, which can adequately assess the competence of such person  with regard to all of the above standards. Certification must be related  and limited to the use and handling of each individual pesticide for  which he desires certification at any time. Therefore, the applicator  will be authorized to use only the pesticide(s) for which he has  demonstrated competence. A specific procedure is required for Sec.  171.5(a)(2) relating to label comprehension, with testing designed to  assure his knowledge of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Understanding of the label and labeling information including  those items indicated in that subsection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sources of advice and guidance necessary for the safe and  proper use of each pesticide related to his certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p>
