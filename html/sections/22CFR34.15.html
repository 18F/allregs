                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>, STATE shall  select the time, date, and location of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Outside hearings shall be conducted by a hearing official not  under the supervision or control of STATE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the employee requests a hearing, the  hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to  be provided. If the hearing will be oral, notice shall set forth the  date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper,  the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in  writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the  record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable  time to submit documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oral hearing. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be  provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the  matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g.,  when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is  not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an  evidentiary hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines that an oral  hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a  review of the available written record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record. The hearing official must maintain a summary record of  any hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses who provide testimony  will do so under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Content of decision. The written decision shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the facts presented to support the origin,  nature, and amount of the debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary  offset will commence, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown (e.g.,  excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be  deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and  amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. The hearing  official shall schedule a new hearing date upon the request of the  creditor agency representative when good cause is shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official  certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for  purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does  not supersede the finding by STATE that a debt is owed and does not  affect the Government's ability to recoup the indebtedness through  alternative collection methods under Sec. 34.10.</p>
