Such report will be submitted not later than the date which is the mid-point of the initial period of import relief, or any extension thereof. In the course of preparing each such report, the Commission will hold a hearing at which interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited disclosure of certain confidential business information under administrative protective order.
