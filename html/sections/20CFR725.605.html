                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as is otherwise provided in this part, no suspension,  termination or other failure to pay benefits awarded to a claimant is  permitted. If an employer found liable for the payment of such benefits  fails to make such payments within 30 days after any date on which such  benefits are due and payable, the person to whom such benefits are  payable may, within one year after such default, make application to the  district director for a supplementary order declaring the amount of the  default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If after investigation, notice and hearing as provided in  subparts E and F of this part, a default is found, the district director  or the administrative law judge, if a hearing is requested, shall issue  a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default, if any. In  cases where a lump-sum award has been made, if the payment in default is  an installment, the district director or administrative law judge, may,  in his or her discretion, declare the whole of the award as the amount  in default. The applicant may file a certified copy of such  supplementary order with the clerk of the Federal district court for the  judicial district in which the operator has its principal place of  business or maintains an office or for the judicial district in which  the injury occurred. In case such principal place of business or office  is in the District of Columbia, a copy of such supplementary order may  be filed with the clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia. Such supplementary order shall be final and the court shall,  upon the filing of the copy, enter judgment for the amount declared in  default by the supplementary order if such supplementary order is in  accordance with law. Review of the judgment may be had as in civil suits  for damages at common law. Final proceedings to execute the judgment may  be had by writ of execution in the form used by the court in suits at  common law in actions of assumpsit. No fee shall be required for filing  the supplementary order nor for entry of judgment thereon, and the  applicant shall not be liable for costs in a proceeding for review of  the judgment unless the court shall otherwise direct. The court   shall modify such judgment to conform to any later benefits order upon  presentation of a certified copy thereof to the court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In cases where judgment cannot be satisfied by reason of the  employer's insolvency or other circumstances precluding payment, the  district director shall make payment from the fund, and in addition,  provide any necessary medical, surgical, and other treatment required by  subpart J of this part. A defaulting employer shall be liable to the  fund for payment of the amounts paid by the fund under this section; and  for the purpose of enforcing this liability, the fund shall be  subrogated to all the rights of the person receiving such payments or  benefits.</p>
