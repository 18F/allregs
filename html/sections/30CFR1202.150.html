                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Royalties due on gas production from leases subject to the  requirements of this subpart, except helium produced from Federal  leases, shall be at the rate established by the terms of the lease.  Royalty shall be paid in value unless ONRR requires payment in kind.  When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty  purposes, determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 1206 of this title  multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All gas (except gas unavoidably lost or used on, or for the  benefit of, the lease, including that gas used off-lease for the benefit  of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the BSEE or BLM, as  appropriate) produced from a Federal lease to which this subpart applies  is subject to royalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When gas is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a  production facility handling production from more than one lease with  the approval of BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility  handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate  share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to  operate the production facility may be used royalty free.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this subpart,  the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If BLM determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an  onshore lease, or that gas was drained from an onshore lease for which  compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that gas was  avoidably lost or wasted from an OCS lease, then the value of that gas  shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost  gas, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This  paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to  a Federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not  actually take the proportionate share of the production attributable to  its Federal lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of  production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement  nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements  of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section,  the value for royalty purposes of production attributable to unitized or  communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part  1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the  circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the  production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be  considered as controlling in arriving at the value for royalty purposes  of that portion, as if the person actually selling or disposing of the  production were the lessee of the Federal lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Federal lessee takes less than its proportionate share of  agreement production, upon request of the lessee ONRR may authorize a  royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purpose of these  regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which  royalties are due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking  volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any  month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed  to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their  proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement  production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of  its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this  section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior  periods at the time the lessee subsequently takes more than its  proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a  sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For production from Federal leases which are committed to  federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon  request of a lessee ONRR may establish the value of production pursuant  to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this  title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent  with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms and  agreement terms; (2) to the extent practical, persons with an interest  in the agreement, including royalty interests, are given notice and an  opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is  authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in  a Federal lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests,  must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the  agreement for royalty purposes.
