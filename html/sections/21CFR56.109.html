The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in Sec.  50.25, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent in accordance with Sec.  50.27 of this chapter, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The IRB may, for some or all subjects, waive the requirement that the subject, or the subject's legally authorized representative, sign a written consent form if it finds that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IRB may, for some or all subjects, find that the requirements in Sec.  50.24 of this chapter for an exception from informed consent for emergency research are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases where the documentation requirement is waived under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing. For investigations involving an exception to informed consent under Sec.  50.24 of this chapter, an IRB shall promptly notify in writing the investigator and the sponsor of the research when an IRB determines that it cannot approve the research because it does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under Sec.  50.24(a) of this chapter or because of other relevant ethical concerns. The written notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by these regulations at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An IRB shall provide in writing to the sponsor of research involving an exception to informed consent under Sec.  50.24 of this chapter a copy of information that has been publicly disclosed under Sec.  50.24(a)(7)(ii) and (a)(7)(iii) of this chapter. The IRB shall provide this information to the sponsor promptly so that the sponsor is aware that such disclosure has occurred. Upon receipt, the sponsor shall provide copies of the information disclosed to FDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When some or all of the subjects in a study are children, an IRB must determine that the research study is in compliance with part 50, subpart D of this chapter, at the time of its initial review of the research. When some or all of the subjects in a study that was ongoing on April 30, 2001, are children, an IRB must conduct a review of the research to determine compliance with part 50, subpart D of this chapter, either at the time of continuing review or, at the discretion of the IRB, at an earlier date.
