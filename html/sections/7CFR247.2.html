                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How does CSFP help participants? Through CSFP, the Department provides nutritious commodities to help State and local agencies meet the nutritional needs of low-income elderly persons. CSFP also helps State and local agencies meet the nutritional needs of women, infants, and children who were certified and receiving CSFP benefits as of February 6, 2014. Through local agencies, each participant receives a monthly package of commodities, based on food package guide rates developed by FNS, with input from State and local agencies. Food packages include such nutritious foods as canned fruits and vegetables, canned meat, poultry and other protein items, and grain products such as pasta, as well as other foods. Participants are offered the opportunity to receive nutrition education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How many persons may be served in CSFP? State agencies may serve eligible persons up to the caseload limit assigned to them by FNS. Caseload is the number of persons that may be served on an average monthly basis over the course of the caseload cycle, which extends from January 1 through the following December 31.
