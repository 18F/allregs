                            <p class="depth0">Where the transmission path is obstructed the received signal must  be adjusted to include shadow loss. Attenuation due to shadowing must be  taken from Sec. 80.769 Graph 1, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inspect the map(s) to determine if a hill(s) obstructs an  imaginary line of   sight (dashed line on illustrative profiles of Sec. 80.769 Graph 1 from  the average terrain elevation at the coast station antenna to the water  level at the ship location. If average terrain elevation exceeds the  actual ground elevation at the antenna site, the latter elevation must  be used as the average terrain elevation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a hill appears to obstruct the radio path, plot the antenna  site elevation, the obstruction elevation and the height of the ship  station on rectangular coordinate paper using elevation above mean sea  level as the vertical scale and distance in statute miles as the  horizontal scale. Then draw a straight line between the antenna and the  ship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a hill obstructs the imaginary line of sight, determine its  height (H) above the imaginary line and its distance (D) from either the  coast or ship station, whichever is nearer, as illustrated by examples  ``A'' and ``B'' on Graph 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Read the shadow loss from this Graph 1 and subtract that loss  from the computed received signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where more than one hill obstructs the transmission path,  determine the height and position of a single equivalent hill, as  illustrated by example ``C'' on this graph. Read the shadow loss from  this graph for the equivalent hill.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AP91.007</p>
