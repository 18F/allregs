                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At any time before an order issued under Sec. 107.317 or  Sec. 107.323 is referred to the Attorney General for enforcement, the  respondent or the Office of Chief Counsel may propose a compromise as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In civil penalty cases, the respondent or Chief Counsel may  offer to compromise the amount of the penalty by submitting an offer for  a specific amount to the other party. An offer of compromise by the  respondent shall be submitted to the Chief Counsel who may, after  consultation with the Associate Administrator, accept or reject it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A compromise offer stays the running of any response period then  outstanding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a compromise is agreed to by the parties, the respondent is  notified in writing. Upon receipt of payment by Office of Chief Counsel,  the respondent is notified in writing that acceptance of payment is in  full satisfaction of the civil penalty proposed or assessed, and Office  of Chief Counsel closes the case with prejudice to the respondent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a compromise cannot be agreed to, the respondent is  notified in writing and is given 10 days or the amount of time remaining  in the then outstanding response period, whichever is longer, to respond  to whatever action was taken by the Office of Chief Counsel or the  Administrator, PHMSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In compliance order cases, the respondent may propose a consent  agreement to the Chief Counsel. If the Chief Counsel accepts the  agreement, he issues an order in accordance with its terms. If the Chief  Counsel rejects the agreement, he directs that the proceeding continue.  An agreement submitted to the Chief Counsel must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of any allegations of fact which the respondent  challenges;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons why the terms of a compliance order or proposed  compliance order are or would be too burdensome for the respondent, or  why such terms are not supported by the record in the case;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A proposed compliance order suitable for issuance by the Chief  Counsel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An admission of all jurisdictional facts; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An express waiver of further procedural steps and all right to  seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity of  the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the respondent  or Office of Chief Counsel may propose to settle the case. If the Chief  Counsel agrees to a settlement, the respondent is notified and the case  is closed without prejudice to the respondent.
