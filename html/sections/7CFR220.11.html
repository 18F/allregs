                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be entitled to reimbursement under this part, each School Food Authority shall submit to the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, a monthly Claim for Reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims for Reimbursement shall include data in sufficient detail to justify the reimbursement claimed and to enable the State agency to provide the Reports of School Program Operations required under Sec. 220.13(b)(2). Unless otherwise approved by FNS, the Claim for Reimbursement for any month shall include only breakfasts served in that month except if the first or last month of Program operations for any year contains 10 operating days or less, such month may be added to the Claim for Reimbursement for the appropriate adjacent month; however, Claims for Reimbursement may not combine operations occurring in two fiscal years. If a single State agency administers any combination of the Child Nutrition Programs, the SFA shall be able to use a common claim form with respect to claims for reimbursement for meals served under those programs. A final Claim for Reimbursement shall be postmarked and/or submitted to the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, not later than 60 days following the last day of the full month covered by the claim. State agencies may establish shorter deadlines at their discretion. Claims not postmarked and/or submitted within 60 days shall not be paid with Program funds unless FNS determines that an exception should be granted. The State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall promptly take corrective action with respect to any Claim for Reimbursement as determined necessary through its claim review process or otherwise. In taking such corrective action, State agencies may make upward adjustments in Program funds claimed on claims filed within the 60 day deadline if such adjustments are completed within 90 days of the last day of the claim month and are reflected in the final Report of School Program Operations (FNS-10) for the claim month which is required under Sec. 220.13(b)(2). Upward adjustments in Program funds claimed which are not reflected in the final FNS-10 for the claim month shall not be made unless authorized by FNS. Downward adjustments in Program funds claimed shall always be made, without FNS authorization, regardless of when it is determined that such adjustments are necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a school participates in both the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program, the State agency or FNSRO, where applicable, may authorize the submission of one claim for reimbursement to cover both programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, may advance funds available for the School Breakfast Program to a School Food Authority in an amount equal to the reimbursement estimated for the total number of breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfasts, to be served to children for 1 month. The

State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall require School Food Authorities who receive advances of funds under the provisions of this paragraph to make timely submissions of claims for reimbursement on a monthly basis and shall suspend advances of funds in the absence of such timely submissions. Following the receipt of claims the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall make such adjustments as are necessary in such advances of funds to insure that the total amount of reimbursement received by a School Food Authority for the fiscal year will not exceed an amount equal to the number of breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfast, served to children times the respective rates of reimbursement assigned by the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, in accordance with Sec. 220.9.
