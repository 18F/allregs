Drinking Water Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 300g-1). These regulations control contaminants in drinking water that primarily affect the aesthetic qualities relating to the public acceptance of drinking water. At considerably higher concentrations of these contaminants, health implications may also exist as well as aesthetic degradation. The regulations are not Federally enforceable but are intended as guidelines for the States.</p>
