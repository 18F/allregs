                                Sec. 2001.30  Automatic declassification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All departments and agencies that have original  classification authority or previously had original classification  authority, or maintain records determined to be permanently valuable  that contain classified national security information, shall comply with  the automatic declassification provisions of the Order. All agencies  with original classification authority shall cooperate with NARA in  managing automatic declassification of accessioned Federal records,  presidential papers and records, and donated historical materials under  the control of the Archivist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presidential papers, materials, and records. The Archivist shall  establish procedures for the declassification of presidential, vice- presidential, or White House materials transferred to the legal custody  of NARA or maintained in the presidential libraries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classified information in the custody of contractors, licensees,  certificate holders, or grantees. Pursuant to the provisions of the  National Industrial Security Program, agencies must provide security  classification/declassification guidance to such entities or individuals  who possess classified information. Agencies must also determine if  classified Federal records are held by such entities or individuals, and  if so, whether they are permanent records of historical value and thus  subject to section 3.3 of the Order. Until such a determination has been  made by an appropriate agency official, such records shall not be  subject to automatic declassification, or destroyed, and shall be  safeguarded in accordance with the most recent security classification/ declassification guidance provided by the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transferred information. In the case of classified information  transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely  for storage,   the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unofficially transferred information. In the case of classified  information that is not officially transferred as described in paragraph  (d) of this section but that originated in an agency that has ceased to  exist and for which there is no successor agency, the agency in  possession shall serve as the originating agency and shall be  responsible for actions for those records in accordance with section 3.3  of the Order and in consultation with the Director of the National  Declassification Center (NDC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Processing records originated by another agency. When an agency  uncovers classified records originated by another agency that appear to  meet the criteria for referral according to section 3.3(d) of the Order,  the finding agency shall identify those records for referral to the  originating agency as described in Sec. 2001.34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unscheduled records. Classified information in records that have  not been scheduled for disposal or retention by NARA is not subject to  section 3.3 of the Order. Classified information in records that become  scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is already more  than 20 years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification  provisions of section 3.3 of the Order five years from the date the  records are scheduled. Classified information in records that become  scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is less than 20  years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification provisions  of section 3.3 of the Order at 25 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Temporary records and non-record materials. Classified  information contained in records determined not to be permanently  valuable or non-record materials shall be processed in accordance with  section 3.6(c) of the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Foreign government information. The declassifying agency is the  agency that initially received or classified the information. When  foreign government information appears to be subject to automatic  declassification, the declassifying agency shall determine whether the  information is subject to a treaty or international agreement that does  not permit automatic or unilateral declassification. The declassifying  agency shall also determine if another exemption under section 3.3(b) of  the Order, such as the exemption that pertains to United States foreign  relations, may apply to the information. If the declassifying agency  believes such an exemption may apply, it should consult with any other  concerned agencies in making its declassification determination. The  declassifying agency or the Department of State, as appropriate, may  consult with the foreign government prior to declassification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Assistance to the Archivist of the United States. Agencies shall  consult with the Director of the NDC established in section 3.7 of the  Order concerning their automatic declassification programs. At the  request of the Archivist, agencies shall cooperate with the Director of  the NDC in developing priorities for the declassification of records to  ensure that declassification is accomplished efficiently and in a timely  manner. Agencies shall consult with NARA and the Director of the NDC  before reviewing records in their holdings to ensure that appropriate  procedures are established for maintaining the integrity of the records  and that NARA receives accurate and sufficient information about agency  declassification actions, including metadata and other processing  information, when records are accessioned by NARA. This data shall  include certification by the agency that the records have been reviewed  in accordance with Public Law 105-261, section 3161 governing Restricted  Data and Formerly Restricted Data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Use of approved declassification guides. Approved  declassification guides are the sole basis for the exemption from  automatic declassification of specific information as provided in  section 3.3(b) of the Order and the sole basis for the continued  classification of information under section 3.3(h) of the Order. These  guides must be prepared in accordance with section 3.3(j) of the Order  and include additional pertinent detail relating to the exemptions  described in sections 3.3(b) and 3.3(h) of the Order, and follow the  format required of declassification guides as described in Sec. 2001.32.  During a review   under section 3.3 of the Order, it is expected that agencies will use  these guides to identify specific information for exemption from  automatic declassification. It is further expected that the guides or  detailed declassification guidance will be made available to the NDC  under section 3.7(b) of the Order and to appropriately cleared  individuals of other agencies to support equity recognition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Automatic declassification date. No later than December 31 of  the year that is 25 years from the date of origin, classified records  determined to be permanently valuable shall be automatically  declassified unless automatic declassification has been delayed for any  reason as provided in Sec. 2001.30(n) and sections 3.3(b) and (c) of the  Order. If the date of origin of an individual record cannot be readily  determined, the date of original classification shall be used instead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Exemption from Automatic Declassification at 25, 50, or 75  years. Agencies may propose to exempt from automatic declassification  specific information, either by reference to information in specific  records, in specific file series of records, or in the form of a  declassification guide, in accordance with section 3.3(j) of the Order.  Agencies may propose to exempt information within five years of, but not  later than one year before the information is subject to automatic  declassification. The agency head or senior agency official, within the  specified timeframe, shall notify the Director of ISOO, serving as the  Executive Secretary of the Panel, of the specific information being  proposed for exemption from automatic declassification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Delays in the onset of automatic declassification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Media  that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more  difficult or costly. An agency head or senior agency official shall  consult with the Director of the NDC before delaying automatic  declassification for up to five years for classified information  contained in media that make a review for possible declassification more  difficult or costly. When determined by NARA or jointly determined by  NARA and another agency, the following may be delayed due to the  increased difficulty and cost of conducting declassification processing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records requiring extraordinary preservation or conservation  treatment, to include reformatting, to preclude damage to the records by  declassification processing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Records which pose a potential menace to health, life, or  property due to contamination by a hazardous substance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Electronic media if the media is subject to issues of software  or hardware obsolescence or degraded data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referred records. Records containing classified information that  originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect  the interests or activities of other agencies and could reasonably be  expected to fall under one or more of the exemption categories of  section 3.3(b) of the Order shall be identified prior to the onset of  automatic declassification for later referral to those agencies.  Declassification reviewers shall be trained periodically on other agency  equities to aid in the proper identification of other agency equities  eligible for referral.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information properly identified as a referral to another agency  contained in records accessioned by NARA or in the custody of the  presidential libraries shall be subject to automatic declassification  only after the referral has been made available by NARA for agency  review in accordance with Sec. 2001.34, provided the information has not  otherwise been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under  section 3.3 of the Order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information properly identified as a referral to another agency  contained in records maintained in the physical, but not legal, custody  of NARA shall be subject to automatic declassification after  accessioning and in accordance with Sec. 2001.34, provided the  information has not otherwise been properly exempted by an equity  holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Newly discovered records. An agency head or senior agency  official must consult with the Director of ISOO on any decision to delay  automatic declassification of newly discovered records no later than 90  days, from the   discovery of the records. The notification shall identify the records,  their volume, the anticipated date for declassification, and the  circumstances of the discovery. An agency may be granted up to three  years from the date of discovery to make a declassification, exemption,  or referral determination. If referrals to other agencies are properly  identified, they will be handled in accordance with subparagraphs 2(i)  and 2(ii) above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Integral file blocks. Classified records within an integral file  block that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under  section 3.3 of the Order shall not be automatically declassified until  December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most  recent record within the file block. For purposes of automatic  declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only records dated  within ten years of the oldest record in the file block. Integral file  blocks applied prior to December 29, 2009, that cover more than ten  years remain in effect until December 31, 2012, unless an agency  requests an extension from the Director of ISOO on a case-by-case basis  prior to December 31, 2011, which is subsequently approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> File series exemptions. Agencies seeking to delay the automatic  declassification of a specific series of records as defined in section  6.1(r) of the Order because it almost invariably contains information  that falls within one or more of the exemption categories under section  3.3(b) must submit their request in accordance with section 3.3(c) of  the Order to the Director of ISOO, serving as Executive Secretary of the  Panel, at least one year prior to the onset of automatic  declassification. Once approved by the Panel, the records in the file  series exemption remain subject to section 3.5 of the Order. This delay  applies only to records within the specific file series. Copies of  records within the specific file series or records of a similar topic to  the specific file series located elsewhere may be exempted in accordance  with exemptions approved by the Panel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Redaction standard. Agencies are encouraged but are not required  to redact documents that contain information that is exempt from  automatic declassification under section 3.3 of the Order, especially if  the information that must remain classified comprises a relatively small  portion of the document. Any such redactions shall be performed in  accordance with policies and procedures established in accordance with  Sec. 2001.45(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restricted  Data and Formerly Restricted Data are excluded from the automatic  declassification requirements in section 3.3 of the Order because they  are classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.  Restricted Data concerns:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The production of special nuclear material, e.g., enriched  uranium or plutonium; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The use of special nuclear material in the production of  energy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Formerly Restricted Data is information that is still classified  under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, but which has been  removed from the Restricted Data category because it is related  primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any document marked as containing Restricted Data or Formerly  Restricted Data or identified as potentially containing unmarked  Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data shall be referred to the  Department of Energy in accordance with Sec. 2001.34(b)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Automatic declassification of documents containing Restricted  Data or Formerly Restricted Data is prohibited. Documents marked as  containing Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data are excluded from  the automatic declassification provisions of the Order until the  Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data designation is properly  removed by the Department of Energy. When the Department of Energy  determines that a Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data  designation may be removed, any remaining information classified under  the Order must be referred to the appropriate agency in accordance with  the declassification provisions of the Order and this Directive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any document containing information concerning foreign nuclear  programs that was removed from the Restricted Data category in order to  carry out provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended,  shall be referred to the Department of Energy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Secretary of Energy shall determine when information  concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted  Data category in order to carry out the provisions of the National  Security Act of 1947, as amended, may be declassified. Unless otherwise  determined, information concerning foreign nuclear programs (e.g.,  intelligence assessments or reports, foreign nuclear program information  provided to the U.S. Government) shall be declassified when comparable  information concerning the United States nuclear program is  declassified. When the Secretary of Energy determines that information  concerning foreign nuclear programs may be declassified, any remaining  information classified under the Order must be referred to the  appropriate agency in accordance with the declassification provisions of  the Order and this Directive.</p>
