The applications  shall be subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No specified form of application is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each application shall contain three copies of an exploration  plan which complies with the requirements of Sec. 3482.1(a) of this  title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each application and its supporting documents shall be filed  with a nonrefundable filing fee (43 CFR 3473.2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exploration license applications shall normally cover no more  than 25,000 acres in a reasonably compact area and entirely within one  state. An application for an exploration license covering more than  25,000 acres must include a justification for an exception to the normal  acreage limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this subpart shall preclude the authorized officer  from issuing a call for expressions of leasing interest in an area  containing exploration licenses or applications for exploration  licenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicants for exploration licenses shall be required to provide  an opportunity for other parties to participate in exploration under the  license on a pro rata cost sharing basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately upon the filing of an application for an exploration  license the applicant shall publish a ``Notice of Invitation,'' approved  by the authorized officer, once every week for 2 consecutive weeks in at  least one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the lands  covered by the license application are situated. This notice shall  contain an invitation to the public to participate in the exploration  under the license and shall contain the location of the Bureau of Land  Management office in which the application shall be available for  inspection. Copies of the Notice of Invitation shall be filed with the  authorized officer at the time of publication by the applicant, for  posting in the proper Bureau of Land Management Office and for Bureau of  Land Management's publication of the Notice of Invitation in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person who seeks to participate in the exploration program  contained in the application shall notify the authorized officer and the  applicant in writing within 30 days after the publication in the Federal  Register. The authorized officer may require modification of the  original exploration plan to accommodate the legitimate exploration  needs of persons seeking to participate, and to avoid the duplication of  exploration activities in the same area, or may notify the person  seeking to participate that the person should file a separate  application for an exploration license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An application to conduct exploration which could have been  conducted as a part of exploration under an existing or recent coal  exploration license may be rejected.
