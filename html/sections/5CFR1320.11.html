                                Sec. 1320.11  Clearance of collections of information in proposed rules.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in  proposed rules published for public comment in the Federal Register in  accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(iv)</em> and Sec. 1320.8(d)(1) and (3), in the preamble to  the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking a statement that the collections of  information contained in the proposed rule, and identified as such, have  been submitted to OMB for review under section 3507(d) of the Act. The  notice shall direct comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for [name of agency].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All such submissions shall be made to OMB not later than the day  on which the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published in the Federal   Register, in such form and in accordance with such procedures as OMB may  direct. Such submissions shall include a copy of the proposed regulation  and preamble.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 60 days of publication of the proposed rule, but subject  to paragraph (e) of this section, OMB may file public comments on  collection of information provisions. The OMB comments shall be in the  form of an OMB Notice of Action, which shall be sent to the Senior  Official or agency head, or their designee, and which shall be made a  part of the agency's rulemaking record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an agency submission is not in compliance with paragraph (b)  of this section, OMB may, subject to paragraph (e) of this section,  disapprove the collection of information in the proposed rule within 60  days of receipt of the submission. If an agency fails to submit a  collection of information subject to this section, OMB may, subject to  paragraph (e) of this section, disapprove it at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> OMB shall provide at least 30 days after receipt of the proposed  collection of information before submitting its comments or making its  decision, except as provided under Sec. 1320.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the final rule is published in the Federal Register, the  agency shall explain how any collection of information contained in the  final rule responds to any comments received from OMB or the public. The  agency shall include an identification and explanation of any  modifications made in the rule, or explain why it rejected the comments.  If requested by OMB, the agency shall include OMB's comments in the  preamble to the final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If OMB has not filed public comments under paragraph (c) of this  section, or has approved without conditions the collection of  information contained in a rule before the final rule is published in  the Federal Register, OMB may assign an OMB control number prior to  publication of the final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> On or before the date of publication of the final rule, the  agency shall submit the final rule to OMB, unless it has been approved  under paragraph (g) of this section (and not substantively or materially  modified by the agency after approval). Not later than 60 days after  publication, but subject to paragraph (e) of this section, OMB shall  approve, instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change  to, or disapprove, the collection of information contained in the final  rule. Any such instruction to change or disapprove may be based on one  or more of the following reasons, as determined by OMB:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency has failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency had substantially modified the collection of  information contained in the final rule from that contained in the  proposed rule without providing OMB with notice of the change and  sufficient information to make a determination concerning the modified  collection of information at least 60 days before publication of the  final rule; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases in which OMB had filed public comments under paragraph  (c) of this section, the agency's response to such comments was  unreasonable, and the collection of information is unnecessary for the  proper performance of the agency's functions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After making such decision to approve, to instruct the agency to  make a substantive or material change to, or disapprove, the collection  of information, OMB shall so notify the agency. If OMB approves the  collection of information or if it has not acted upon the submission  within the time limits of this section, the agency may request, and OMB  shall assign an OMB control number. If OMB disapproves or instructs the  agency to make substantive or material change to the collection of  information, it shall make the reasons for its decision publicly  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> OMB shall not approve any collection of information under this  section for a period longer than three years. Approval of such  collection of information will be for the full three-year period, unless  OMB determines that there are special circumstances requiring approval  for a shorter period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> After receipt of notification of OMB's approval, instruction to  make a substantive or material change to, disapproval of a collection of  information, or failure to act, the agency shall publish a notice in the  Federal Register to inform the public of OMB's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> As provided in Sec. 1320.5(b) and Sec. 1320.6(a), an agency may  not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless the collection  of information displays a currently valid OMB control number and the  agency informs potential persons who are to respond to the collection of  information that such persons are not required to respond to the  collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB  control number.</p>
