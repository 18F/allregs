An agency may pay a retention incentive to  an employee under this section when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee holds a position listed in Sec. 575.303, and is  not excluded by Sec. 575.304;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee's rating of record (or an official performance  appraisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter  43 or 5 CFR part 430) is at least ``Fully Successful'' or equivalent;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency has provided a general or specific written notice to  the employee that his or her position may or would be affected by the  closure or relocation of the employee's office, facility, activity, or  organization (e.g., the employee's position may or would move to a new  geographic location or the employee's position may or would be  eliminated).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention incentive plan and approval levels. Before authorizing  a retention incentive under this section, an agency must include in its  retention incentive plan established under   Sec. 575.307(a) the conditions and requirements governing the use of  retention incentives under this section for employees who would be  likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service before  the closure or relocation of the employees' office, facility, activity,  or organization, including a designation of the authorized agency  officials who may approve retention incentives under this section,  consistent with the approval requirements in Sec. 575.307(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval criteria and written determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each  determination to pay a retention incentive under this section, an agency  must document in writing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The basis for determining the agency has a special need for the  employee's (or group of employees') services that makes it essential to  retain the employee(s), based on the agency's mission needs and the  employee's (or group of employees') competencies, during a period of  time before the closure or relocation of the employee's (or group of  employees') office, facility, activity, or organization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for determining, in the absence of a retention  incentive, the employee (or a significant number of employees in a  group) would be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal  service; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The basis for establishing the amount and timing of the  approved retention incentive payment and the length of the required  service period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agency must address the following factors when documenting  the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for an  individual employee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The factors for authorizing a retention incentive for an  individual employee described in Sec. 575.306(b) as they relate to a  determination made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the employee's departure for a different  position in the Federal service would affect the agency's ability to  carry out an activity, perform a function, or complete a project the  agency deems essential to its mission before and during the closure or  relocation period (e.g., the agency's need to retain the employee to  ensure minimal disruption in the performance of mission-critical  functions, continuity of key operations, or minimal disruption of  service to the public before and during the closure or relocation; to  train new employees who will move with the organization to the new  geographic location; to assist with the actual closure or relocation of  the office, facility, activity, or organization; or to perform similar  mission-essential functions before or during the closure or relocation);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The competencies possessed by the employee that are essential  to retain; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, or  legislative branch) for which the employee would be likely to leave in  the absence of the retention incentive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agency must address the following factors when documenting  the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for a group  or category of employees:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The factors for authorizing a retention incentive for a group or  category of employees described in Sec. 575.306(c) as they relate to  the determination made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> through (d)(2)(iv) of this  section as they relate to the determination made under paragraph (a)(2)  of this section for the group or category of employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An agency must narrowly define a targeted category of employees  using factors that relate to the conditions described in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section. The factors that may be appropriate are  described in Sec. 575.306(c)(2), except that each group retention  incentive authorized under this section may cover no more than one  occupational series.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment of retention incentives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the provisions regarding computing and  paying retention incentives under Sec. 575.309 apply to computing and  paying retention incentives under this section for employees who would  be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service  before the closure or relocation of the their office, facility,  activity, or organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agency may not pay retention incentives under this section in  biweekly installments at the full retention incentive percentage rate  established for the employee under Sec. 575.309(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service agreement requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The service agreement  provisions in Sec. Sec. 575.310(b) through 575.310(e) apply to  retention incentive service agreements under this section, subject to  the additional requirements in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before paying a retention incentive under this section, an  agency must require an employee, including each employee covered by a  group retention incentive authorization, to sign a written service  agreement to complete a specified period of employment with the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In no event, may the service period under a service agreement  established under this paragraph extend past the date on which the  employee's position is actually affected by the relocation or closure of  the employee's office, facility, activity, or organization (e.g., the  date the employee's position moves to a new geographic location or the  date the employee's position is eliminated).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to the terminating conditions in Sec. 575.310(d)  and (e), the service agreement must include the conditions under which  the agency must terminate the service agreement under paragraph (g) of  this section, including the conditions under which the agency will pay  an additional retention incentive payment for partially completed  service under Sec. 575.311.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The service agreement must include a notification to the  employee that the agency will review the determination to pay the  retention incentive at least annually to determine whether payment is  still warranted, as required by paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Termination of retention incentives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions in Sec.  575.311 regarding termination of retention incentive service agreements  and paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(4) of this section apply to the  termination of retention incentives authorized under this section. Each  determination to pay a retention incentive under this section must be  reviewed at least annually to determine if payment is still warranted.  An authorized agency official must certify this determination in  writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the terminating conditions in Sec. 575.311(a)  and (b), an authorized agency official must terminate a retention  incentive service agreement under this section if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The closure or relocation is cancelled or no longer affects the  employee's position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee moves to another position not affected by the  closure or relocation (including another position within the same  agency);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For relocation situations, the employee accepts the agency's  offer to relocate with his or her the office, facility, activity, or  organization and, thus, the employee is no longer likely to leave for a  different position in the Federal service; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The employee moves to a different position in the same office,  facility, activity, or organization subject to closure or relocation  that is not covered by the employee's service agreement. In this  situation, the agency may authorize a new retention incentive for the  employee under this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement  under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this section in cases in which the  employee's movement to another position is by management action and not  at the employee's request or under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section,  the employee is entitled to retain any retention incentive payments that  are attributable to completed service and to receive any portion of a  retention incentive payment owed by the agency for completed service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement  in termination actions under paragraph (g)(2) of this section that are  not covered by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the employee is  entitled to retain retention incentive payments previously paid by the  agency that are attributable to the completed portion of the service  period. If the employee received retention incentive payments that are   less than the amount that would be attributable to the completed portion  of the service period, the agency is not obligated to pay the employee  the amount attributable to completed service, unless the agency agreed  to such payment under the terms of the retention incentive service  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Monitoring requirements. The monitoring requirements in Sec.  575.312 apply to retention incentives authorized under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Records and reports. In addition to the recordkeeping  requirements in Sec. 575.313, each agency must submit a written report  to OPM by March 31 of each year on the use of retention incentives under  this section. Each report must include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of how the authority to pay retention incentives  under this section was used in the agency during the previous calendar  year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number and dollar amount of retention incentives paid during  the previous calendar year to individuals under this section by  occupational series and grade, pay level, or other pay classification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, legislative  branch) to which each employee would be likely to leave in the absence  of a retention incentive;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each employee's official worksite and the geographic location of  the agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, or legislative  branch) for which each employee would be likely to leave in the absence  of a retention incentive; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other information, records, reports, and data as OPM may  require.
