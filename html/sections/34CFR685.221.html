                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjusted gross income (AGI) means the borrower's adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For a married borrower filing jointly, AGI includes both the borrower's and spouse's income. For a married borrower filing separately, AGI includes only the borrower's income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligible loan means any outstanding loan made to a borrower under the FFEL or Direct Loan programs except for a defaulted loan, a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, or a FFEL or Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a FFEL or Direct PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Family size means the number that is determined by counting the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Live with the borrower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size. Support includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car, medical and dental care, and payment of college costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> New borrower means an individual who has no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loan on July 1, 2014, or who has no outstanding balance on such a loan on the date he or she obtains a loan after July 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Partial financial hardship means a circumstance in which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an unmarried borrower or a married borrower who files an individual Federal tax return, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the difference between the borrower's AGI and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a married borrower who files a joint Federal tax return with his or her spouse, the annual amount due on all of the borrower's eligible loans and, if applicable, the spouse's eligible loans, as calculated under a standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period, using the greater of the amount due at the time the loans initially entered repayment or at the time the borrower or spouse elects the income-based repayment plan, exceeds 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the difference between the borrower's and spouse's AGI, and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Poverty guideline refers to the income categorized by State and family size in the poverty guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms of the repayment plan. (1) A borrower may select the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A borrower may select the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent or, for a new borrower, 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary adjusts the calculated monthly payment if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except for borrowers provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the total amount of the borrower's eligible loans are not Direct Loans, in which case the Secretary determines the borrower's adjusted monthly payment by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Both the borrower and borrower's spouse have eligible loans and filed a joint Federal tax return, in which case the Secretary determines--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each borrower's percentage of the couple's total eligible loan debt;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The adjusted monthly payment for each borrower by multiplying the calculated payment by the percentage determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the borrower's loans are held by multiple holders, the borrower's adjusted monthly Direct Loan payment by multiplying the payment determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by the percentage of the total outstanding principal amount of the borrower's eligible loans that are Direct Loans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(2)(ii) of this section is less than $5.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $0.00; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The calculated amount under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(2)(ii) of this section is equal to or greater than $5.00 but less than $10.00, in which case the borrower's monthly payment is $10.00.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's Direct Subsidized loan or the subsidized portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan, the Secretary does not charge the borrower the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on that loan under the income-based repayment plan. Any period during which the Secretary has previously not charged the borrower accrued interest on an eligible loan under the Pay As You Earn repayment plan counts toward the maximum three years of subsidy a borrower is eligible to receive under the income-based repayment plan. On a Direct Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has not charged the borrower accrued interest, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary did not charge the borrower accrued interest on the underlying loans. This three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized at the time a borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any of the principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The repayment period for a borrower under the income-based repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment application and prepayment. (1) The Secretary applies any payment made under the income-based repayment plan in the following order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary applies any payment made under the income-based repayment plan in the following order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Accrued interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Collection costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Late charges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Loan principal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without penalty, as provided under Sec. 685.211(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds a monthly payment amount of $10.00 or more under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of Sec. 685.211(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the prepayment amount exceeds a monthly payment amount of $0.00 under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the Secretary applies the prepayment consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Changes in the payment amount. (1) If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the income-based repayment plan, but the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment. The Secretary also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as result of the recalculation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship, the borrower may continue to make payments under the income-based repayment plan, but the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment. The Secretary also recalculates the monthly payment for a borrower who chooses to stop making income-based payments. In either case, as result of the recalculation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum monthly amount that the Secretary requires the borrower to repay is the amount the borrower would have paid under the standard repayment plan based on a 10-year repayment period using the amount of the borrower's eligible loans that was outstanding at the time the borrower began repayment on the loans under the income-based repayment plan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower's repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the standard repayment plan and the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a borrower no longer wishes to pay under the income-based repayment plan, the borrower must pay under the standard repayment plan and the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment based on--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan, the time remaining under the maximum ten-year repayment period for the amount of the borrower's loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For a Direct Consolidation Loan, the time remaining under the applicable repayment period as initially determined under Sec. 685.208(j) and the amount of that loan that was outstanding at the time the borrower discontinued paying under the income-based repayment plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A borrower who no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan and who is required to repay under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may request a change to a different repayment plan after making one monthly payment under the Direct Loan standard repayment plan. For this purpose, a monthly payment may include one payment made under a forbearance that provides for accepting smaller payments than previously scheduled, in accordance with Sec. 685.205(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligibility documentation, verification, and notifications. (1) The Secretary determines whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower selects the plan and for each subsequent year that the borrower remains on the plan.

If the borrower fails to certify family size, the Secretary assumes a family size of one for that year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After making a determination that a borrower has a partial financial hardship to qualify for the income-based repayment plan for the year the borrower initially elects the plan and for any subsequent year that the borrower has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower's scheduled monthly payment amount, as calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the time period during which this scheduled monthly payment amount will apply (annual payment period);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information about the requirement for the borrower to annually provide the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the borrower chooses to remain on the income-based repayment plan after the initial year on the plan, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified in advance of the date by which the Secretary must receive this information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An explanation of the consequences, as described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (e)(7) of this section, if the borrower does not provide the required information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An explanation of the consequences if the borrower no longer wishes to repay under the income-based repayment plan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time during the borrower's current annual payment period, that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount that was used to calculate the borrower's current monthly payment no longer reflects the borrower's current income. If the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the borrower's request, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each subsequent year that a borrower who currently has a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than 60 days and no earlier than 90 days prior to the date specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The notification provides the borrower with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date, no earlier than 35 days before the end of the borrower's annual payment period, by which the Secretary must receive all of the information described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (annual deadline); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consequences if the Secretary does not receive the information within 10 days following the annual deadline specified in the notice, including the borrower's new monthly payment amount as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the effective date for the recalculated monthly payment amount, and the fact that unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized at the end of the borrower's current annual payment period in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each time the Secretary makes a determination that a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship for a subsequent year that the borrower wishes to remain on the plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that provides the borrower with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower's recalculated monthly payment amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation that unpaid interest will be capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information about the borrower's option to request, at any time, that the Secretary redetermine whether the borrower has a partial financial hardship, if the borrower's financial circumstances have changed and the income amount used to determine that the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship does not reflect the borrower's current income, and an explanation that the borrower will be notified annually of this option. If the Secretary determines that the borrower again has a partial financial hardship, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's monthly payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each subsequent year that a borrower who does not currently have a partial financial hardship remains on the income-based repayment plan, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notification that includes the information described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a borrower who is currently repaying under another repayment plan selects the income-based repayment plan but does not provide the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section, or if the Secretary determines that the borrower does not have a partial financial hardship, the borrower remains on his or her current repayment plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Secretary designates the repayment option described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a borrower who is currently repaying under the income-based repayment plan remains on the plan for a subsequent year but the Secretary does not receive the information described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(ii) of this section within
