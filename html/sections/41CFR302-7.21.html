                                Sec.  302-7.21  If my HHG shipment includes an item for which a weight ultralight vehicle), am I responsible for payment?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No, you will not be responsible for the shipping charges that result from a weight additive so long as the actual weight of your HHG without the additive does not exceed the 18,000 pound net weight allowance for relocation. However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You are also responsible for the cost of special packing, crating, and handling of the weight additive items, if any. See Sec.  302-7.200 on how charges are paid and who makes the shipping arrangements.
