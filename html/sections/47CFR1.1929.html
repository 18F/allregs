This will be done when funds are available for payment in one lump sum. However, if the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The size of the installment deductions will bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay (see the FCCS). However, the installments will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deduction will generally commence with the next full pay interval (ordinarily the next biweekly pay period) following the date: of the employee's written consent to salary offset, the waiver of hearing, or the decision issued by the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Installment deductions will be pro-rated for a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment except as provided in Sec. 1.1930.</p>
