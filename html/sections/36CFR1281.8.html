                                Sec. 1281.8  What information must be provided to NARA for its report
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NARA must submit a report to Congress on a proposed new library pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). The foundation that is building the library must help NARA as necessary in compiling the information needed for this report. If a State, political subdivision, university, institution of higher learning, or institute participates in the construction of the new library (e.g., by making land available for the facility), that party is subject to the same requirement. Requested information must be sent to the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001 far enough in advance of the anticipated date of transfer of the Library for NARA to compile and submit the report so that it may lie before Congress for the minimum time period specified in 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(5). The normal lead time for submitting the required information is a least six months in advance of the anticipated date of transfer, but the submission date is subject to negotiation between NARA and the foundation in specific cases. The collection of information by NARA for these purposes has been approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0036.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a)(3) of 44 U.S.C. 2112 lists the information that NARA must include in its report to Congress. The foundation and NARA will agree as part of the planning process for a new library on what information the foundation will provide and when. The same requirement applies to other entities involved in the construction of a new library (e.g., a local government or university). Foundations will normally be responsible, at a minimum, for providing the following information to NARA:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the land, facility, and equipment offered as a gift or to be made available without transfer of title, which must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The legal description of the land, including plat, and evidence of clear title to the land upon which the library is constructed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Site plan, floor plans, building sections and elevations, artist's representation of building and grounds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Description of building contents, including furniture, equipment, and museum installations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Measurement of the facility in accordance with Sec. 1281.16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement specifying the estimated total cost of the library and the amount of the endowment required pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An offer or other statement setting forth the terms of the proposed agreement for transfer or use of the facility, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of any proposed agreements between the state, other political subdivision, the donating group, other institutions, and the United States which may affect ownership or operation of the library facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement of and copies of any proposed agreements concerning the proposed support of library programs by non-federal sources; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement on cost-saving design features of the building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A written certification that the library and the equipment therein will comply with NARA standards.</p>
