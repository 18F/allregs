                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Building components. In insured advances for building components  stored off-site, the term building component shall mean any manufactured  or pre-assembled part of a structure that HUD has specifically  identified for incorporation into the property and has designated for  off-site storage because it is of such size or weight that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Storage of the number of components required for timely  construction progress at the construction site is impractical, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Weather damage or other adverse conditions prevailing at the  construction site would make storage at the site impractical or unduly  costly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Storage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An insured advance may be made for up to 90 percent  of the invoice value (to exclude costs of transportation and storage) of  the building components stored off-site, if the components are stored at  a location approved by the mortgagee and HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each building component shall be adequately marked so as to be  readily identifiable in the inventory of the off-site location. Each  component shall be kept together with all other building components of  the same manufacturer intended for use in the same project for which  insured advances have been made and separate and apart from similar  units not for use in the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Storage costs, if any, shall be borne by the contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility for transportation, storage, and insurance of  off-site building components. The general contractor of the insured  mortgaged property shall have the responsibility for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insuring the components in the name of the mortgagor while in  transit and storage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delivering or contracting for the delivery of the components to  the storage area and to the construction site, including payment of  freight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before an advance for a building component stored  off-site is insured:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The mortgagor shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Obtain a bill of sale for the component;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Give the mortgagee a security agreement; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> File a financing statement in accordance with the Uniform  Commercial Code; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mortgagee shall warrant to HUD that the security  instruments are   a first lien on the building components covered by the instruments  except for such other liens or encumbrances as may be approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before each advance for building components stored off-site is  insured, the mortgagor's architect shall certify to HUD that the  components, in their intended use, comply with HUD-approved contract  plans and specifications. Under those circumstances permitted by HUD in  which there is no architect, compliance with the HUD-approved contract  plans and specifications shall be determined by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advances may be made only for components stored off-site in a  quantity required to permit uninterrupted installation at the site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At no time shall the invoice value of building components being  stored off-site, for which advances have been HUD insured, represent  more than 50 percent of the total estimated construction costs for the  insured mortgaged project as specified in the construction contract.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and other regulatory requirements  that set bonding requirements, the percentage of total estimated  construction costs insured by advances under this section may exceed 25  percent but not 50 percent if the mortgagor furnishes assurance of  completion in the form of a corporate surety bond for the payment and  performance each in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the  construction contract. In no event will insurance of advances for  components stored off-site be made in the absence of a payment and a  performance bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No single advance that is to be insured shall be in an amount  less than $10,000.</p>
