                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the earliest practicable time, the State agency shall notify  the Federal agency and the applicant whether the State agency concurs  with or objects to a consistency certification. The State agency may  issue a general concurrence for minor activities (see Sec. 930.53(b)).  Concurrence by the State agency shall be conclusively presumed if the  State agency's response is not received within six months following  commencement of State agency review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the State agency has not issued a decision within three  months following commencement of State agency review, it shall notify  the applicant and the Federal agency of the status of the matter and the  basis for further delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the State agency issues a concurrence or is conclusively  presumed to concur with the applicant's consistency certification, the  Federal agency may approve the federal license or permit application.  Notwithstanding State agency concurrence with a consistency  certification, the federal permitting agency may deny approval of the  federal license or permit application. Federal agencies should not delay  processing applications pending receipt of a State agency's concurrence.  In the event a Federal agency determines that an application will not be  approved, it shall immediately notify the applicant and the State  agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the period when the State agency is reviewing the  consistency   certification, the applicant and the State agency should attempt, if  necessary, to agree upon conditions, which, if met by the applicant,  would permit State agency concurrence. The parties shall also consult  with the Federal agency responsible for approving the federal license or  permit to ensure that proposed conditions satisfy federal as well as  management program requirements (see also Sec. 930.4).</p>
