Sec. 2920.2-1  Discussion of proposals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Suggestions by land use proponent. Any person who seeks to use public lands may contact the Bureau of Land Management office having jurisdiction over the public lands in question and discuss the land use proposal. This contact should be made as early as possible so that administrative requirements and potential conflicts with other land uses can be identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Response by the authorized officer. The authorized officer will discuss with the land use proponent whether the requested land use, suitability or non-suitability of the requested land use based on a preliminary examination of existing land use plans, where available, is or is not in conformance with Bureau of Land Management policies and programs for the lands, local zoning ordinances and any other pertinent information. The authorized officer will discuss administrative requirements for the type of land use authorization which may be granted (lease, permit or easement), including, but not limited to: additional information which may be required; qualifications; cost reimbursement requirements; associated clearances, other permits or licenses which may be required; environmental and management considerations; and special requirements such as competitive bidding and identification of on-the-ground investigations which may be required in order to issue a land use authorization.


Sec. 2920.2-2  Minimum impact permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The authorized officer may, without publication of a notice of realty action, issue a permit for a land use upon a determination that the proposed use is in conformance with Bureau of Land Management plans, policies and programs, local zoning ordinances and any other requirements and will not cause appreciable damage or disturbance to

the public lands, their resources or improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Permit decisions made under paragraph (a) of this section take effect immediately upon execution, and remain in effect during the period of time specified in the decision to issue the permit. Any person whose interest is adversely affected by a decision to grant or deny a permit under paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the Board of Land Appeals under part 4 of this title. However, decisions and permits issued under paragraph (a) of this section will remain in effect until stayed.

Sec. 2920.2-4  Proposal content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Proposals for a land use authorization shall include a description of the proposed land use in sufficient detail to enable the authorized officer to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed land use, the impacts if any, on the environment, the public or other benefits from the proposed land use, the approximate cost of the proposal, any threat to the public health and safety posed by the proposal and whether the proposal is, in the proponent's opinion, in conformance with Bureau of Land Management plans, programs and policies for the public lands covered by the proposal.

Sec. 2920.2-5  Proposal review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A land use proposal shall, upon submission, be reviewed to determine if the public lands covered by the proposal are appropriate for the proposed land use and if the proposal is otherwise legal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the proposal is found to be appropriate for further consideration, the authorized officer shall examine the proposal and make one of the following determinations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proposed land use is in conformance with the appropriate land use plan and can be approved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The proposed land use has not been addressed in an existing land use plan and shall be addressed in accordance with the procedure in part 1600 of this title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The proposed land use is in an area not covered in an existing land use plan and shall be processed in accordance with the procedure in Sec. 1601.8 of this title; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The proposed land use is not in conformance with the approved land use plan.
