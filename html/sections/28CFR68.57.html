If a final agency order issued under Sec. 68.52(d) is not appealed, the Special Counsel (or, if the Special Counsel fails to act, the person filing the charge, other than the Immigration and Naturalization Service officer) may file a petition in the United States District Court for the district in which the violation that is the subject of the final agency order is alleged to have occurred, or in which the respondent resides or transacts business, requesting that the order be enforced.
