                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The HUD Field Office will provide written notification of its  decision to an occupant who makes a timely request to continue to occupy  the property. The decision of the HUD Field Office on this matter will  be made by the Chief, Property Disposition. If the decision is to deny  the request, the notice to the occupant will include a statement of the  reason or reasons for the decision and of the occupant's right to  appeal. The occupant may appeal HUD's decision within 20 days after the  date of HUD's notice. The appeal must be addressed to the Field Office  Manager and be in writing, and the occupant may provide documentation  intended to refute the reasons given for HUD's decision. The occupant  may also request an informal conference with a representative of the HUD  Field Office Manager. A request for an informal conference must be made  in writing within 10 days after the date of HUD's notice. The occupant  may be represented at the conference by counsel or by other persons with  pertinent expert knowledge or experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After notification that HUD has denied a request for continued  occupancy, the occupant, on his or her request, shall be permitted to  review all relevant material in HUD's possession (including a copy of  the inspection report if the request is denied because the property is  not habitable as defined in Sec. 203.673). Only material in HUD's  possession that directly pertains to conditions for continued occupancy  under Sec. Sec. 203.670, 203.673, and 203.674 may be considered material  relevant for an   occupant's review under this paragraph. This review shall be limited to  a review of material for purposes of the informal conference or the  appeal of the Department's decision. The information will only be  provided after request for an informal conference or appeal has been  submitted to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After consideration of an appeal, the HUD Field Office will  notify the applicant in writing of HUD's final decision. This final  decision will be made by the HUD Field Office Manager or a  representative of the Field Office Manager (other than the Chief,  Property Disposition). If the decision is to deny the occupant's  request, the notice to the occupant will reflect consideration of the  issues raised by the occupant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, after consideration of an appeal, the Field Office Manager  denies the request for new or additional reasons, the occupant will be  afforded an opportunity to request that the Field Office Manager  reconsider its decision under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this  section.  [53 FR 875, Jan. 14, 1988, and 53 FR 8626, Mar. 16, 1988]</p>
