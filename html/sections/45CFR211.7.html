If at the time of arrival from a foreign country or any time during temporary or continuing care and treatment the Administrator finds that the best interests of the eligible person will be served thereby, and a relative, having been fully informed of his condition, agrees in writing to assume responsibility for his care and treatment, the Administrator shall transfer and release him to such relative. In determining whether his best interest will be served by such transfer and release, due weight shall be given to the relationship of the individuals involved, the financial ability of the relative to provide for such person, and the accessibility to necessary medical facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer and release to appropriate State authorities, or agency of the United States. If appropriate arrangements cannot be accomplished under paragraph (a) of this section, and if no other agency of the United States is responsible for the care and treatment of the eligible person, the Administrator shall endeavor to arrange with the appropriate State mental health authorities of the eligible person's State of residence or legal domicile, if any, for the assumption of responsibility for the care and treatment of the eligible person by such authorities and shall, upon the making of such arrangements in writing, transfer and release him to such authorities. If any other agency of the United States is responsible for the care and treatment of the eligible person, the Administrator shall make arrangements for his transfer and release to that agency.</p>
