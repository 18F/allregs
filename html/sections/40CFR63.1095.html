                            <p class="depth0">For waste that is not transferred off-site, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section for continuous butadiene waste streams and paragraph (b) of this section for benzene waste streams. If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements of Sec.  63.1096.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Continuous butadiene waste streams. Manage and treat continuous butadiene waste streams that contain greater than or equal to 10 ppmw 1,3-butadiene and have a flow rate greater than or equal to 0.02 liters per minute, according to either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply also.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Route the continuous butadiene stream to a treatment process or wastewater treatment system used to treat benzene waste streams that complies with the standards specified in 40 CFR 61.348.

You may validate 40 CFR part 136 methods for 1,3-butadiene according to the procedures in appendix D to this part. You do not need to determine the butadiene concentration of a waste stream if you

designate that the stream must be controlled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with 40 CFR 61.342(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) for each waste management unit that receives or manages the waste stream prior to and during treatment or recycling of the waste stream.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Comply with the recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR 61.356(b), (b)(1) and (b)(2), except substitute ``1,3-butadiene'' for each occurrence of ``benzene'' and ``continuous butadiene waste stream'' for each occurrence of ``waste stream.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Comply with the reporting requirements in 40 CFR 61.357(a), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(3)(iii) through (v), and (d)(1) and (2), except substitute ``1,3-butadiene'' for each occurrence of ``benzene'' and ``continuous butadiene waste stream'' for each occurrence of ``waste stream.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Include only the information in 40 CFR 61.357(a)(2) and (a)(3)(iii) through (v) in the report required in 40 CFR 61.357(a) and (d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply with the process wastewater requirements of subpart G of this part. Submit the information required in Sec.  63.146(b) in the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec.  63.1110(d). Submit the information required in Sec.  63.146(c) through (e) in either the Periodic Reports required in Sec.  63.152 or the Periodic Reports required in Sec.  63.1110(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), comply with the requirements of this section at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, if the startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the affected source to comply with the requirements of this section and the owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in Sec.  63.1111.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waste streams that contain benzene. For waste streams that contain benzene, you must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, except as specified in Table 2 to this subpart. You must manage and treat waste streams that contain benzene as specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), manage and treat spent caustic waste streams and dilution steam blowdown waste streams according to 40 CFR 61.342(c)(1) through (c)(3)(i). The requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, if the startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the affected source to comply with the requirements of this section and the owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in Sec.  63.1111.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is greater than or equal to 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), you must manage and treat waste streams according to any of the options in 40 CFR 61.342(c)(1) through (e) or transfer waste off-site.
