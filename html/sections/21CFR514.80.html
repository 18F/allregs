The name and address of the distributor must be preceded by an appropriate qualifying phrase as permitted by the regulations such as ``manufactured for'' or ``distributed by.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other labeling changes must be the subject of a supplemental NADA or ANADA as described under Sec. 514.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A signed statement by the distributor stating:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The category of the distributor's operations (e.g., wholesale or retail),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the distributor will distribute the new animal drug only under the approved labeling,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That the distributor will promote the product only for use under the conditions stated in the approved labeling,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That the distributor will adhere to the records and reports requirements of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> That the distributor is regularly and lawfully engaged in the distribution or dispensing of prescription products if the product is a prescription new animal drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Multiple applications. Whenever an applicant is required to submit a periodic drug experience report under the provisions of Sec. 514.80(b)(4) with respect

to more than one approved NADA or ANADA for preparations containing the same new animal drug so that the same information is required to be reported for more than one application, the applicant may elect to submit as a part of the report for one such application (the primary application) all the information common to such applications in lieu of reporting separately and repetitively on each. If the applicant elects to do this, the applicant must do the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State when a report applies to multiple applications and identify all related applications for which the report is submitted by NADA or ANADA number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that the primary application contains a list of the NADA or ANADA numbers of all related applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submit a completed Form FDA 2301 to the primary application and each related application with reference to the primary application by NADA/ANADA number and submission date for the complete report of the common information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All other information specific to a particular NADA/ANADA must be included in the report for that particular NADA/ANADA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reporting forms.

If FDA finds that the applicant has failed to establish the required records, or has failed to maintain those records, or failed to make the required reports, or has refused access to an authorized FDA officer or employee to copy or to verify such records or reports, FDA may withdraw approval of the application to which such records or reports relate. If FDA determines that withdrawal of the approval is necessary, the agency shall give the applicant notice and opportunity for hearing, as provided in Sec. 514.200, on the question of whether to withdraw approval of the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclaimer. Any report or information submitted under this section and any release of that report or information by FDA will be without prejudice and does not necessarily reflect a conclusion that the report or information constitutes an admission that the drug caused or contributed to an adverse event. A person need not admit, and may deny, that the report or information constitutes an admission that a
