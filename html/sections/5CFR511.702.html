                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to Sec. 511.703, the effective date of a change in the  classification of a position resulting from a classification appeal  decision by either an agency or the Office is not earlier than the date  of the decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay  period following the date of the decision, except when a subsequent date  is specifically provided in the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The implementation of the decision may be suspended by the  Office when it determines before the effective date that a review of the  decision is warranted. The determination to suspend implementation may  be made by the Director or the Director's designee. Suspending the  implementation does not change the effective date of the decision except  when the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the  position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay  retention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the  position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay  retention, the reviewing authority, if sustaining the original decision,  shall issue a new certificate and the effective date of the new  certificate shall be not earlier than the date of the new decision and  not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date  of the new decision, unless a subsequent   date is specifically stated in the new decision.
