                            <p class="depth0">If, while an inter partes proceeding involving an application under section 1 or 44 of the Act is pending, facts appear which, in the opinion of the trademark examining attorney, render the mark in the application unregistrable, the facts should be called to the attention of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The Board may suspend the proceeding and refer the application to the trademark examining attorney for an ex parte determination of the question of registrability. A copy of the trademark examining attorney's final action will be furnished to the parties to the inter partes proceeding following the final determination of registrability by the trademark examining attorney or the Board on appeal. The Board will consider the application for such further inter partes action as may be appropriate.
