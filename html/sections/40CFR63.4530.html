If you are using the predominant activity  alternative under Sec. 63.4490(c), you must keep records of the data  and calculations used to determine the predominant activity. If you are  using the facility-specific emission limit alternative under Sec.  63.4490(c), you must keep records of the data used to calculate the  facility-   specific emission limit for the initial compliance demonstration.

If you conducted  testing to determine mass fraction of organic HAP, density, or mass  fraction of coating solids, you must keep a copy of the complete test  report. If you use information provided to you by the manufacturer or  supplier of the material that was based on testing, you must keep the  summary sheet of results provided to you by the manufacturer or  supplier.
