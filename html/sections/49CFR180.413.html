Any repair, modification, stretching, rebarrelling, or mounting of a cargo tank must be performed in conformance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, each repair, modification, stretching, or rebarrelling of a specification cargo tank must be performed by a repair facility holding a valid National Board Certificate of Authorization for use of the National Board ``R'' stamp and must be made in accordance with the edition of the National Board Inspection Code in effect at the time the work is performed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Repairs, modifications, stretchings, and rebarrellings performed on non-ASME stamped specification cargo tanks may be performed by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A cargo tank manufacturer holding a valid ASME Certificate of Authorization for the use of the ASME ``U'' stamp using the quality control procedures used to obtain the Certificate of Authorization; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A repair facility holding a valid National Board Certificate of Authorization for use of the National Board ``R'' stamp using the quality control procedures used to obtain the Certificate of Authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A repair, modification, stretching, or rebarrelling of a non-ASME stamped cargo tank may be done without certification by an Authorized Inspector, completion of the R-1 form, or being stamped with the ``R'' stamp.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to each repair, modification, stretching, rebarrelling, or mounting, the cargo tank motor vehicle must be emptied of any hazardous material lading. In addition, cargo tank motor vehicles used to transport flammable or toxic lading must be sufficiently cleaned of residue and purged of vapors so any potential hazard is removed, including void spaces between double bulkheads, piping and vapor recovery systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each person performing a repair, modification, stretching, rebarrelling or mounting of a DOT specification cargo tank must be registered in accordance with subpart F of part 107 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repair. The suitability of each repair affecting the structural integrity or lading retention capability of the cargo tank must be determined by the testing required either in the applicable manufacturing specification or in Sec. 180.407(g)(1)(iv). Each repair of a cargo tank involving welding on the shell or head must be certified by a Registered Inspector. The following provisions apply to specific cargo tank repairs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect at the time of repair;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, and MC 306 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 406 specification in effect at the time of repair;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> MC 304 and MC 307 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 407 specification in effect at the time of repair;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 412 specification in effect at the time of repair;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> MC 338 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect at the time of repair; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the repair procedures described in CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) and the National Board Inspection Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Each cargo tank having cracks or other defects requiring welded repairs must meet all inspection, test, and heat treatment requirements in Sec. 178.337-16 of this subchapter in effect at the time of the repair, except that postweld heat treatment after minor weld repairs is not required. When a repair is made of defects revealed by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection, including those repaired by grinding, the affected area of the cargo tank must again be examined by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method after hydrostatic testing to assure that all defects have been removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintenance or replacement of piping, valves, hoses, or fittings. After each repair, maintenance or replacement of a pipe, valve, hose, or fitting on a cargo tank, that component must be installed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable specification before the cargo tank is returned to service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After maintenance or replacement that does not involve welding on the cargo tank wall, the repaired or replaced piping, valve, hose, or fitting must be tested for leaks. This requirement is met when the piping, valve, hose, or fitting is tested after installation in accordance with Sec. 180.407(h)(1). A hose may be tested before or after installation on the cargo tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After repair or replacement of piping, valves, or fittings that involves welding on the cargo tank wall, the cargo tank must be pressure tested in accordance with the applicable manufacturing specification or Sec. 180.407(g)(1)(iv). In addition, the affected piping, valve, or fitting must be tested in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hoses on cargo tanks in dedicated liquefied compressed gas, except carbon dioxide, service are excepted from these testing requirements, but must be tested in accordance with Sec. 180.416(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification, stretching, or rebarrelling. Modification, stretching or rebarrelling of a cargo tank motor vehicle must conform to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design of the modified, stretched, or rebarrelled cargo tank motor vehicle must be certified in writing by a Design Certifying Engineer as meeting the structural integrity and accident damage protection requirements of the applicable specification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, all new material and equipment affected by modification, stretching, or rebarrelling must meet the requirements of the specification in effect at the time such work is performed, and all applicable structural integrity requirements (Sec. 178.337-3, Sec. 178.338-3, or Sec. 178.345-3 of this subchapter). The work must conform to the requirements of the applicable specification as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For specification MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305 and MC 306 cargo tanks, the provisions of either specification MC 306 or DOT 406 until August 31, 1995 and, thereafter to specification DOT 406 only;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For specification MC 304 and MC 307 cargo tanks, the provisions of either specification MC 307 or DOT 407
