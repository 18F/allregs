                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In projects involving grants-in-aid under the Federal-aid  Airport Program, a sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire an  adequate property interest in runway clear zone areas as prescribed in  paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, as applicable. Property  interests that a sponsor acquires to meet the requirements of this  section are eligible for inclusion in the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On new airports, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to  acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas (in  connection with initial land acquisition) for all eligible runways or  landing strips, without substantial deviation from standard  configuration and length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On existing airports where new runways or landing strips are  developed, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate  property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway and  landing strip to be developed or extended, to the extent that the  Administrator determines practical and feasible considering all facts  presented by the airport owner or operator, preferably without  substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On existing airports where improvements are made to runways or  landing strips, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire  adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway  or landing strip that is to be improved to the extent that the  Administrator determines is practical and feasible with regard to   standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all  facts presented by the airport owner or operator. Any development that  improves a specific runway or landing strip is considered to be a runway  improvement, including runway lighting and the developing or lighting of  taxiways serving a runway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On existing airports where substantial improvements are made  that do not benefit a specific runway or landing strip, such as overall  grading or drainage, terminal area or building developments, the sponsor  must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in  runway clear zone areas for the dominant runway or landing strip to the  extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible, with  regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests,  considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a sponsor or other public agency shows that it is legally  able to prevent the future erection or creation of obstructions in the  runway clear zone area, and adopts protective measures to prohibit their  future erection or creation, that showing is acceptable for the purposes  of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section in place of an adequate  property interest (except for rights required for removing existing  obstructions). In such a case, there must be an agreement between the  FAA and the sponsor for removing or marking or lighting (to be  determined in each case) any existing obstruction to air navigation In  each case, the sponsor must furnish information as to the specific  height limitations established and as to the current and foreseeable  future use of the property to which they apply. The information must  include an acceptable legal opinion of the validity of the measures  adopted, including a conclusion that the height limitations are not  unreasonable in view of current and foreseeable future use of the  property, and are a reasonable exercise of the police power, together  with the reasons or basis supporting the opinion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The authority exercised by the Administrator under paragraphs  (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section to allow a deviation from, or the  extent of conformity to, standard configuration or length of runway  clear zones, or to determine the adequacy of property interests therein,  is also exercised by Regional Directors.
