                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of adequately controlling the cargo, both under  normal operating and casualty conditions, every cargo piping system  shall be provided with one of the following sets of control valves and  meet the requirements listed below. Cargo tanks, whether gravity or  pressure vessel type, for cargoes having a saturated vapor pressure of  10 pounds per square inch gauge or less at 115 [deg]F (105 [deg]F if the  tank is insulated) shall be provided with a valving system designated as  Gravity-1. Cargo tanks, whether gravity or pressure vessel type, for  cargoes which are carried below ambient temperature and whose vapor  pressure is maintained at 10 pounds per square inch gauge or below shall  be provided with a valving system designated as Gravity-2. Cargo tanks  for cargoes which have vapor pressures above 10 p.s.i.g. at 115 [deg]F  (105 [deg]F if tank is insulated) shall be provided with a valving  system designated as Pressure-1. Cargo tanks for cargoes which have  vapor pressures above 10 pounds per square inch gauge at 115 [deg]F (105  [deg]F if tank is insulated) and which require greater protection due to  their hazardous characteristics shall be provided with a valving system  designated as Pressure-2. The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d)  of this section for stop valves or excess flow valves to be fitted at  tank penetrations are not applicable to nozzles at which pressure vacuum  or safety relief valves are fitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gravity-1 (G-1). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One manually operated stop valve shall be  installed on each tank filling and discharge line, located near the tank  penetration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One stop valve or blind flange shall be installed at each cargo  hose connection. When a cargo hose connection is in use, it shall be  provided with a stop valve; which may be part of the vessel's equipment  or may be part of the shore facility and attached to the barge end of  the loading hose. When a cargo hose connection is not in use, it may be  secured with a blind flange.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If individual deepwell pumps are used to discharge the contents  of each cargo tank, and the pumps are provided with a remote shutdown  device, a stop valve at the tank is not required on the tank discharge  line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gravity-2 (G-2). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One manually operated stop valve shall be  installed on each tank penetration, located as close as possible to the  tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One remote operated, quick closing shut-off valve shall be  installed at each cargo hose connection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A remote shutdown device shall be installed for all cargo  handling machinery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pressure-1 (P-1). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One manually operated stop valve and one  excess flow valve shall be installed on each tank penetration, located  as close as possible to the tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One manually operated stop valve shall be installed at each  cargo hose connection, when in use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pressure-2 (P-2). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One manually operated stop valve and one  excess flow valve shall be installed at each tank penetration, located  as close as possible to the tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One remote operated quick closing shutoff valve shall be  installed at each cargo hose connection when in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No tank penetration shall be less than 1 inch diameter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cargo tank penetrations which are connections for gauging or  measuring devices need not be equipped with excess flow or remote  operated quick closing valves provided that the opening is constructed  so that the outward flow of tank contents shall not exceed that passed  by a No. 54 drill size (0.055-inch diameter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The control system for any required quick closing shutoff valves  shall be such that the valves may be operated from at least two remote  locations on the vessel; if means of fire protection is required by  Table 151.05, the control system shall also be provided with fusible  elements designed to melt between 208 [deg]F and 220 [deg]F, which will  cause the quick closing shutoff valves to close in case of fire. Quick   closing shutoff valves shall be of the fail-closed (closed on loss of  power) type and be capable of local manual operation. Quick closing  shutoff valves shall operate from full open to full closed under all  service conditions in not more than 10 seconds, without causing  excessive pressure surges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Excess flow valves, where required, shall close automatically at  the rated closing flow of vapor or liquid as tested and specified by the  manufacturer. The piping, including fittings, valves, and appurtenances  protected by an excess flow valve, shall have a greater capacity than  the rated closing flow of the excess flow valve. Excess flow valves may  be designed with a bypass not to exceed 0.040-inch diameter opening to  allow equalization of pressure, after an operating shutdown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Suitable means shall be provided to relieve the pressure and  remove liquid contents from cargo lines and hoses to the cargo tank or  other safe location prior to effecting disconnections.</p>
