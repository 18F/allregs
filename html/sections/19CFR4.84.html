                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(4)</em>, (5), or (6) of this part.  When merchandise is laden on a foreign vessel in noncontiguous territory  other than Puerto Rico, for transportation on that vessel to a port in  any State, the District of Columbia, or noncontiguous territory, and  when this transportation is not forbidden by the coastwise laws, the  merchandise may be laden and shipped without shipper's export  declarations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The master of every foreign vessel arriving at a port in any  State or the District of Columbia or in noncontiguous territory of the  United States from a port in noncontiguous territory to which the  coastwise laws do not apply (e.g., Virgin Islands and American Samoa),  or arriving at any port in noncontiguous territory to which the  coastwise laws do not apply from any place embraced within the coastwise  laws, shall immediately report its arrival and make entry for the vessel  within 48 hours after its arrival.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A vessel which is not required to clear but which is  transporting merchandise from a port in any State or the District of  Columbia to any noncontiguous territory of the United States (excluding  Puerto Rico), or from Puerto Rico to any State or the District of  Columbia, or any other noncontiguous territory, shall not be permitted  to depart without filing a complete manifest, when required by  regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30), and all  required Shipper's Export Declarations, unless before the vessel departs  an approved bond is filed for the timely production of the required  documents, as specified in 15 CFR 30.24. Requests for permission to  depart may be written or oral and permission to depart shall be granted  orally by the appropriate Customs officer. However, if the request is to  depart prior to the filing of the required manifest and export  declarations, permission shall not be granted unless the appropriate  bond is on file. In the latter case, the Customs officer shall keep a  simplified record of the necessary information in order to assure that  the manifest and export declarations are filed within the required time  period. The Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300  (see Sec. 4.63(a)), required at the time of clearance is not required  to be taken to obtain permission to depart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vessel which is not required to clear but which is  transporting merchandise from a port in any State or the District of  Columbia to Puerto Rico shall file a complete manifest, when required by  the regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30), and all  required Shipper's Export Declarations within one business day after  arrival, as defined in Sec. 4.2(b) of this part, with the appropriate  Customs officer in Puerto Rico. If the complete   manifest and all required Shipper's Export Declarations are not filed  with the appropriate Customs officer within that time frame, an  appropriate bond shall be filed with the Customs officer for the timely  production of the required documents as specified in 15 CFR 30.24. In  these instances when a bond is filed, the Customs officer shall keep a  simplified record of the necessary information in order to ensure that  the manifest and export declarations are filed not later than the  seventh business day after arrival in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon arrival of a vessel of the United States at a port in any  State, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico from a port in  noncontiguous territory other than Puerto Rico, the master shall  immediately report its arrival and shall prepare, produce, and file a  Cargo Declaration in the form and manner and at the times specified in  Sec. Sec. 4.7 and 4.9 but shall not be required to make entry. If the  vessel proceeds directly to another port in any State, the District of  Columbia, or Puerto Rico, the master shall prepare, produce, and file a  Cargo Declaration in the form and manner and at the times specified in  Sec. 4.85 but no permit to proceed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance  Statement, Customs Form 1300, shall be required for the purposes of this  paragraph. No cargo shall be unladen from any such vessel until Cargo  Declarations have been filed and a permit to unlade has been issued in  accordance with the procedure specified in Sec. 4.30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No vessel shall bring guano to the United States from a guano  island appertaining to the United States (see 48 U.S.C. 1411) unless  such a vessel is entitled to engage in the coastwide trade.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No vessel owned by a corporation which qualifies as a citizen  under the Act of September 2, 1958 (46 U.S.C. 883-1) shall, while under  demise or bareboat charter from such corporation, be granted clearance  or permitted to depart in trade with noncontiguous territory.
