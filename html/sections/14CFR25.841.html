                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 feet at the maximum operating altitude of the airplane under normal operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If certification for operation above 25,000 feet is requested, the airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of 15,000 feet after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin pressure altitude that exceeds the following after decompression from any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet for more than 2 minutes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Forty thousand (40,000) feet for any duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuselage structure, engine and system failures are to be considered in evaluating the cabin decompression.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressurized cabins must have at least the following valves, controls, and indicators for controlling cabin pressure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Two pressure relief valves to automatically limit the positive pressure differential to a predetermined value at the maximum rate of flow delivered by the pressure source. The combined capacity of the relief valves must be large enough so that the failure of any one valve would not cause an appreciable rise in the pressure differential. The pressure differential is positive when the internal pressure is greater than the external.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two reverse pressure differential relief valves (or their equivalents) to automatically prevent a negative pressure differential that would damage the structure. One valve is enough, however, if it is of a design that reasonably precludes its malfunctioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A means by which the pressure differential can be rapidly equalized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An automatic or manual regulator for controlling the intake or exhaust airflow, or both, for maintaining the required internal pressures and airflow rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Instruments at the pilot or flight engineer station to show the pressure differential, the cabin pressure altitude, and the rate of change of the cabin pressure altitude.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Warning indication at the pilot or flight engineer station to indicate when the safe or preset pressure differential and cabin pressure altitude limits are exceeded. Appropriate warning markings on the cabin pressure differential indicator meet the warning requirement for pressure differential limits and an aural or visual signal (in addition to cabin altitude indicating means) meets the warning requirement for cabin pressure altitude limits if it warns the flight crew when the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 10,000 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A warning placard at the pilot or flight engineer station if the structure is not designed for pressure differentials up to the maximum relief valve setting in combination with landing loads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The pressure sensors necessary to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section and Sec. 25.1447(c), must be located and the sensing system designed so that, in the event of loss of cabin pressure in any passenger or crew compartment (including upper and lower lobe galleys), the warning and automatic presentation devices, required by those provisions, will be actuated without any delay that would significantly increase the hazards resulting from decompression.
