(This section has been promulgated as a deviation from the FAR as provided in 801.4.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When negotiated changes exceed $500,000, paragraph (a) of the clause at 852.236-88 will apply. Because paragraph (a) does not provide ceiling rates for indirect expenses, the contractor must furnish cost breakdowns and other supporting data on its rates for indirect expenses as part of its price proposal. The contracting officer must negotiate the rates for indirect expenses with the contractor and may request an audit in accordance with FAR 15.404-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the negotiated change will be $500,000 or less, paragraph (b) of the clause at 852.236-88 will apply. Because the indirect cost rates in paragraph (b) of the clause at 852.236-88 are ceiling rates, the contracting officer must negotiate indirect expense rates within the ceiling limitations.</p>
