                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An automated FISH enumeration system is a device  that consists of an automated scanning microscope, image analysis  system, and customized software applications for FISH assays. This  device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use with FISH assays as an  aid in the detection, counting and classification of cells based on  recognition of cellular color, size, and shape, and in the detection and  enumeration of FISH signals in interphase nuclei of formalin-fixed,  paraffin-embedded human tissue specimens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control  is FDA's guidance document entitled ``Class II Special Controls Guidance  Document: Automated Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH)  Enumeration Systems.'' See Sec. 866.1(e) for the availability of this  guidance document.  [70 FR 14534, Mar. 23, 2005]</p>
