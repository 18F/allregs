                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> by  reason of having engaged in a prohibited transaction described in  section 503(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(5)</em> and section 503(e), the term  ``transfer'' includes any gift, contribution, bequest, devise, legacy,  or other disposition. In applying such sections for estate tax purposes,  a transfer, whether made during the decedent's lifetime or by will, is  considered as having been made at the moment of the decedent's death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> for such taxable year is limited by section  681(b), or exemption of the organization for such taxable year is denied  under section 503(a), whether or not the organization has previously  received notification by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that it is  engaged in a prohibited transaction. In certain cases, the limitation of  section 681 or 503 may be removed or the exemption may be reinstated for  certain subsequent taxable years under the rules set forth in the income  tax regulations under sections 681 and 503. In cases in which prior  notification by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not required in  order to limit the deduction of the trust under section 681(d) or to  deny exemption of the organization under section 503, the deduction  otherwise allowable under section 2055 is not disallowed in respect of  transfers made during the same taxable year of the trust or organization  in which a prohibited transaction occurred or in a prior taxable year  unless the decedent or a member of his family was a party to the  prohibited transaction. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the  members of the decedent's family include only his brothers and sisters,  whether by whole or half blood, spouse, ancestors, and lineal  descendants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This section applies only in the case of decedents dying before  January 1, 1970. In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1969,  see Sec. 20.2055-5.
