                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gift has the meaning set forth in Sec. 2635.203(b). For purposes  of that definition an employee will be deemed to have paid market value  for any benefit received as a result of his participation in any carpool  or other such mutual arrangement involving another employee or other  employees if he bears his fair proportion of the expense or effort  involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, has the meaning  set forth in Sec. 2635.203(f). For purposes of Sec. 2635.302(a), it  includes a gift:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Given with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence by his  parent, sibling, spouse, child, or dependent relative; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Given by a person other than the employee under circumstances  where the employee has promised or agreed to reimburse that person or to  give that person something of value in exchange for giving the gift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Official superior means any other employee, other than the  President and the Vice President, including but not limited to an  immediate supervisor, whose official responsibilities include directing  or evaluating the performance of the employee's official duties or those  of any other official superior of the employee. For purposes of this  subpart, an employee is considered to be the subordinate of any of his  official superiors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Solicit means to request contributions by personal communication  or by general announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Voluntary contribution means a contribution given freely,  without pressure or coercion. A contribution is not voluntary unless it  is made in an amount determined by the contributing employee, except  that where an amount for a gift is included in the cost for a luncheon,  reception or similar event, an employee who freely chooses to pay a  proportionate share of the total cost in order to attend will be deemed  to have made a voluntary contribution. Except in the case of  contributions for a gift included in the cost of a luncheon, reception  or similar event, a statement that an employee may choose to contribute  less or not at all shall accompany any recommendation of an amount to be  contributed for a gift to an official superior.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A supervisory employee of the Agency for International  Development has just been reassigned from Washington, DC to Kabul,  Afghanistan. As a farewell party, 12 of her subordinates have decided to  take her out to lunch at the Khyber Repast. It is understood that each  will pay for his own meal and that the cost of the supervisor's lunch  will be divided equally among the twelve. Even though the amount they  will contribute is not determined until the supervisor orders lunch, the  contribution made by those who choose to participate in the farewell  lunch is voluntary.</p>
