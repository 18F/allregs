Upon a request from the individual's commanding officer, the officer in  charge of cognizant Navy and Marine Corps recruiting stations, or  officer selection officer, naval MTFs are authorized to admit such  persons when, in the opinion of the cognizant officer, hospitalization  is necessary for the proper conduct of the special physical  examinations. Hospitalization should be kept to a minimum and treatment  other than for humanitarian reasons, except as provided in this part, is  not authorized.</p>
