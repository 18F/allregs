                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. The determination of whether a PWS is  required to monitor under this rule is based on the type of system  (e.g., community water system, non-transient non-community water system,  etc.), and its retail population, as indicated by SDWIS/Fed on December  31, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability to transient non-community systems. If you own or  operate a transient non-community water system, and you are notified by  your State or EPA, you must permit the State, EPA or their contractors  to collect samples for the contaminants specified on List 3 of Table 1,  in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>. If you believe that your  applicability status is different than EPA has specified in the  notification letter that you received, or if you are subject to UCMR  requirements and you have not been notified by either EPA or your State,  you must report to EPA, as specified in Sec.  141.35(b)(2) or (c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assessment Monitoring. You must monitor for the unregulated  contaminants on List 1 and Total Chromium per Table 1, UCMR Contaminant  List, in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If you serve a population of  more than 10,000 people, you are required to perform this monitoring  regardless of whether you have been notified by the State or EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Screening Survey. You must monitor for the unregulated  contaminants on List 2 (Screening Survey) of Table 1, as specified in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if your system serves 10,001 to  100,000 people and you are notified by EPA or your State that you are  part of the State Monitoring Plan for Screening Survey testing. If your  system serves more than 100,000 people, you are required to conduct this  Screening Survey testing regardless of whether you have been notified by  the State or EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pre-Screen Testing. You must monitor for the unregulated  contaminants on List 3 of Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  if notified by your State or EPA that you are part of the Pre-Screen  Testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (C) of this section.

You must collect samples for each List 1 Assessment  Monitoring contaminant, and, if applicable, for each List 2 Screening  Survey, or List 3 Pre-Screen Testing contaminant, as specified in Table  1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Samples must be collected at  each sample point that is specified in column 5 and footnote c of Table  1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If you are a ground water system  with multiple EPTDSs, and you request and receive approval from EPA or  the State for sampling at representative EPTDS(s), as specified in Sec.   141.35(c)(3), you must collect your samples from the approved  representative sampling location(s). Systems conducting Assessment  Monitoring must also sample for total chromium, chromium-6, cobalt,  molybdenum, strontium, vanadium, and chlorate at the location that  represents the maximum residence time in the distribution system  (DSMRT). DSMRT is defined as an active point (i.e., a location that  currently provides water to customers) in the distribution system where  the   water has been in the system the longest relative to the EPTDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sampling instructions. For each List 1 Assessment Monitoring  contaminant, and, if applicable, for each List 2 Screening Survey, or  List 3 Pre-Screen Testing contaminant, you must follow the sampling  procedure for the method specified in column 3 of Table 1, in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section. In addition, you must not composite (that is,  combine, mix, or blend) the samples; you must collect and preserve each  sample separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Sample collection and shipping time. If you must ship the  samples for analysis, you must collect the samples early enough in the  day to allow adequate time to send the samples for overnight delivery to  the laboratory. You should not collect samples on Friday, Saturday, or  Sunday because sampling on these days may not allow samples to be  shipped and received at the laboratory at the required temperature,  unless you have made special arrangements with your laboratory to  receive the samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Analytical methods. For each contaminant, you must use the  respective analytical methods for List 1, and, if applicable, for List  2, or List 3 that are specified in column 3 of Table 1, in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section; report values at or above the minimum reporting  levels for List 1, and, if applicable, for List 2 Screening Survey, or  List 3 Pre-Screen Testing, that are specified in column 4 of Table 1, in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and conduct the quality control  procedures specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Laboratory errors or sampling deviations. If the laboratory data  do not meet the required QC criteria, as specified in paragraph (a)(5)  of this section, or you do not follow the required sampling procedures,  as specified in paragraphs (a)(4) of this section, you must resample  within 30 days of being informed or becoming aware of these facts. This  resampling is not for the purpose of confirming previous results, but to  correct the sampling or laboratory error. All systems must report the  results obtained from the first sampling for each sampling period,  except for cases of sampling or laboratory errors. For the purposes of  this rule, no samples are to be recollected for the purposes of  confirming the results observed in a previous sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Analysis. For the List 1 contaminants, and, if applicable, List  2 Screening Survey, or List 3 Pre-Screen Testing contaminants,  identified in Table 1, paragraph (a)(3) of this section, you must  arrange for testing by a laboratory that has been approved by EPA  according to requirements in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Review and reporting of results. After you have received the  laboratory results, you must review, approve, and submit the system  information, and sample collection data and test results. You must  report the results as provided in Sec.  141.35(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small systems. If you serve 10,000 or fewer people and are  notified that you are part of the State Monitoring Plan for Assessment  Monitoring, Screening Survey or Pre-Screen monitoring, you must comply  with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) through (H)  of this section. If EPA or the State informs you that they will be  collecting your UCMR samples, you must assist them in identifying the  appropriate sampling locations and in collecting the samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Monitoring period and frequency. You must collect samples at the  times specified for you by the State or EPA. Your schedule must follow  both the timing of monitoring specified in Table 1, List 1, and, if  applicable, List 2, or List 3, and the frequency of monitoring in Table  2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Location. You must collect samples at the locations specified  for you by the State or EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sample kits. You must store and maintain the sample collection  kits sent to you by the UCMR Sampling Coordinator in accordance with the  kit's instructions. The sample kit will include all necessary  containers, packing materials and cold packs, instructions for  collecting the sample and sample treatment (such as dechlorination or  preservation), report forms for each sample, contact name and telephone  number for the laboratory, and a prepaid return shipping docket and  return address label. If any of the materials listed in the kit's  instructions are not   included in the kit or arrive damaged, you must notify the UCMR Sampling  Coordinator who sent you the sample collection kits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sampling instructions. You must comply with the instructions  sent to you by the State or EPA concerning the use of containers,  collection (how to fill the sample bottle), dechlorination and/or  preservation, and sealing and preparation of sample and shipping  containers for shipment. You must not composite (that is, combine, mix,  or blend) the samples. You also must collect, preserve, and test each  sample separately. You must also comply with the instructions sent to  you by the UCMR Sampling Coordinator concerning the handling of sample  containers for specific contaminants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Sampling deviations. If you do not collect a sample according to  the instructions provided to you for a listed contaminant, you must  report the deviation within 7 days of the scheduled monitoring on the  sample reporting form, as specified in Sec.  141.35(d)(2). You must  resample following instructions that you will be sent from the UCMR  Sampling Coordinator or State. A copy of the form must be sent to the  laboratory with the recollected samples, and to the UCMR Sampling  Coordinator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Duplicate samples. EPA will select a subset of systems in the  State Monitoring Plan that must collect duplicate samples for quality  control. If your system is selected, you will receive two sample kits  for an individual sampling location that you must use. You must use the  same sampling protocols for both sets of samples, following the  instructions in the duplicate sample kit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Sampling forms. You must completely fill out each of the  sampling forms and bottles sent to you by the UCMR Sampling Coordinator,  including data elements listed in Sec.  141.35(e) for each sample, as  specified in Sec.  141.35(d)(2). You must sign and date the sampling  forms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Sample collection and shipping. You must collect the samples  early enough in the day to allow adequate time to send the samples for  overnight delivery to the laboratory. You should not collect samples on  Friday, Saturday, or Sunday because sampling on these days may not allow  samples to be shipped and received at the laboratory at the required  temperature unless you have made special arrangements with EPA for the  laboratory to receive the samples. Once you have collected the samples  and completely filled in the sampling forms, you must send the samples  and the sampling forms to the laboratory designated on the air bill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Quality control requirements. If your system serves more than  10,000 people, you must ensure that the quality control requirements  listed below are met during your sampling procedures and by the  laboratory conducting your analyses. You must also ensure that all  method quality control procedures and all UCMR quality control  procedures are followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sample collection/preservation. You must follow the sample  collection and preservation requirements for the specified method for  each of the contaminants in Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section. These requirements specify sample containers, collection,  dechlorination, preservation, storage, sample holding time, and extract  storage and/or holding time that you must assure that the laboratory  follow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Laboratory approval for Lists 1, List 2 and List 3. To be  approved to conduct UCMR testing, the laboratory must be certified under  Sec.  141.28 for one or more compliance analyses; demonstrate for each  analytical method it plans to use for UCMR testing that it can meet the  Initial Demonstration of Capability (IDC) requirements detailed in the  analytical methods specified in column 3 of Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3)  of this section; and successfully participate in the UCMR Proficiency  Testing (PT) Program administered by EPA for each analytical method it  plans to use for UCMR testing. UCMR laboratory approval decisions will  be granted on an individual method basis for the methods listed in  column 3 of Table 1 in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for List 1, List  2, and List 3 contaminants. Laboratory approval is contingent upon the  capability of the laboratory to post monitoring data to the EPA  electronic data reporting system. To participate in the UCMR Laboratory  Approval Program, the laboratory must complete and submit the necessary  registration   forms by August 1, 2012. Correspondence must be addressed to: UCMR  Laboratory Approval Coordinator, USEPA, Technical Support Center, 26  West Martin Luther King Drive, (MS 140), Cincinnati, OH 45268; or  emailed to EPA at: UCMR--Sampling--Coordinator@epa.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimum Reporting Level. The MRL is an estimate of the  quantitation limit. Assuming good instrumentation and experienced  analysts, an MRL is achievable, with 95% confidence, by 75% of  laboratories nationwide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Validation of laboratory performance. Your laboratory must be  capable of quantifying each contaminant listed in Table 1, at or below  the MRL specified in column 4 of Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section. You must ensure that the laboratory completes and has on file  and available for your inspection, records of two distinct procedures.  First, your laboratory must have conducted an IDC involving replicate  analyses at or below the MRL as described in this paragraph. Second, for  each day that UCMR analyses are conducted by your laboratory, a  validation of its ability to quantify each contaminant, at or below the  MRL specified in column 4 of Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, following the procedure listed in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(B) of  this section, must be performed. The procedure for initial validation of  laboratory performance at or below the MRL is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All laboratories performing analysis under UCMR must demonstrate  that they are capable of meeting data quality objectives at or below the  MRL listed in Table 1, column 4, in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The MRL, or any concentration below the MRL, at which  performance is being evaluated, must be contained within the range of  calibration. The calibration curve regression model and the range of  calibration levels that are used in these performance validation steps  must be used in all routine sample analyses used to comply with this  regulation. Only straight line or quadratic regression models are  allowed. The use of either weighted or unweighted models is permitted.  The use of cubic regression models is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Replicate analyses of at least seven (7) fortified samples in  reagent water must be performed at or below the MRL for each analyte,  and must be processed through the entire method procedure (i.e.,  including extraction, where applicable, and with all preservatives).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A prediction interval of results (PIR), which is based on the  estimated arithmetic mean of analytical results and the estimated sample  standard deviation of measurement results, must be determined by  Equation 1: [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  t is the Student's t value with df degrees of freedom and confidence</p><p class="depth0">level (1-[alpha]), s is the sample standard deviation of n replicate samples fortified at</p><p class="depth0">the MRL, n is the number of replicates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The values needed to calculate the PIR using Equation 1 are:  Number of replicates (n); Student's t value with a two-sided 99%  confidence level for n number of replicates; the average (mean) of at  least seven replicates; and the sample standard deviation. Factor 1 is  referred to as the Half Range PIR (HRPIR). [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]   For a certain number of replicates and for a certain confidence level in  Student's t, this factor [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]      is constant, and can be tabulated according to replicate number and  confidence level for the Student's t. Table 3 in this paragraph lists  the constant factor (C) for replicate sample numbers 7 through 10 with a  confidence level of 99% for Student's t.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The HRPIR is calculated by Equation 2: [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The PIR is calculated by Equation 3: [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--The Constant Factor (C) to be Multiplied by the Standard Deviation to Determine the Half Range Interval</p><p class="depth0">of the PIR (Student's t 99% Confidence Level) \a\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Constant factor (C) to be multiplied</p><p class="depth0">Replicates                        Degrees of freedom                 by the standard deviation ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">7                                     6                                 3.963 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">8                                     7                                 3.711 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">9                                     8                                 3.536 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">10                                     9                                3.409 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \a\ The critical t-value for a two-sided 99% confidence interval is equivalent to the critical t-value for a one-</p><p class="depth0">sided 99.5% confidence interval, due to the symmetry of the t-distribution. PIR = Prediction Interval of</p><p class="depth0">Results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The lower and upper result limits of the PIR must be converted  to percent recovery of the concentration being tested. To pass criteria  at a certain level, the PIR lower recovery limits cannot be lower than  the lower recovery limits of the QC interval (50%), and the PIR upper  recovery limits cannot be greater than the upper recovery limits of the  QC interval (150%). When either of the PIR recovery limits falls outside  of either bound of the QC interval of recovery (higher than 150% or less  than 50%), laboratory performance is not validated at the concentration  evaluated. If the PIR limits are contained within both bounds of the QC  interval, laboratory performance is validated for that analyte.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Quality control requirements for validation of laboratory  performance at or below the MRL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must ensure that the calibration curve regression model and  that the range of calibration levels that are used in these performance  validation steps are used in future routine sample analysis. Only  straight line or quadratic regression models are allowed. The use of  either weighted or unweighted models is permitted. The use of cubic  regression models is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must ensure, once your laboratory has performed an IDC as  specified in each analytical method (demonstrating that DQOs are met at  or below an MRL), that a daily performance check is performed for each  analyte and method. A single laboratory blank, fortified at or below the  MRL for each analyte, must be processed through the entire method  procedure. The measured concentration for each analyte must be converted  to a percent recovery, and if the recovery is within 50%-150%  (inclusive), the daily performance of the laboratory has been validated.  The results for any analyte for which 50%-150% recovery cannot be  demonstrated during the daily check are not valid. Laboratories may  elect to re-run the daily performance check sample if the performance  for any analyte or analytes cannot be validated. If performance is  validated for these analytes, the laboratory performance is considered  validated. Alternatively, the laboratory may re-calibrate and repeat the  performance validation process for all analytes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Laboratory fortified sample matrix and laboratory fortified  sample matrix duplicate. You must ensure that your laboratory prepares  and analyzes the Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix   (LFSM) sample for accuracy and Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix  Duplicate (LFSMD) samples for precision to determine method accuracy and  precision for all contaminants in Table 1, in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section. LFSM/LFSMD samples must be prepared using a sample collected  and analyzed in accordance with UCMR requirements and analyzed at a  frequency of 5% (or 1 LFSM/LFSMD set per every 20 samples) or with each  sample batch, whichever is more frequent. In addition, the LFSM/LFSMD  fortification concentrations must be alternated between a low-level  fortification and mid-level fortification approximately 50% of the time.  (For example: A set of 40 samples will require preparation and analysis  of 2 LFSM/LFSMD paired samples. The first LFSM/LFSMD paired sample set  must be fortified at either the low-level or mid-level, and the second  LFSM/LFSMD paired sample set must be fortified with the other standard,  either the low-level or mid-level, whichever was not used for the  initial LFSM/LFSMD paired sample set.) The low-level LFSM/LFSMD  fortification concentration must be within 50% of  the MRL for each contaminant (e.g., for an MRL of 1 [micro]g/L the  acceptable fortification levels must be between 0.5 [micro]g/L and 1.5  [micro]g/L). The mid-level LFSM/LFSMD fortification concentration must  be within 20% of the mid-level calibration  standard for each contaminant, and is to represent, where possible and  where the laboratory has data from previously analyzed samples, an  approximate average concentration observed in previous analyses of that  analyte. There are no UCMR contaminant recovery acceptance criteria  specified for LFSM/LFSMD analyses. All LFSM/LFSMD data are to be  reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Method defined quality control. You must ensure that your  laboratory performs Laboratory Fortified Blanks and Laboratory  Performance Checks, as appropriate to the method's requirements, for  those methods listed in Table 1, column 3, in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section. Each method specifies acceptance criteria for these QC checks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Reporting. You must require your laboratory to submit these  data electronically to the State and EPA using EPA's electronic data  reporting system, accessible at (http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/ rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3/reporting.cfm), within 120 days from the  sample collection date. You then have 60 days from when the laboratory  posts the data to review, approve and submit the data to the State and  EPA, via EPA's electronic data reporting system. If you do not  electronically approve and submit the laboratory data to EPA within 60  days of the laboratory posting data to EPA's electronic reporting  system, the data will be considered approved and available for State and  EPA review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Violation of this rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring violations. Any failure  to monitor in accordance with Sec.  141.40(a)(3)-(5) is a monitoring  violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reporting violations. Any failure to report in accordance with  Sec.  141.35 is a reporting violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Petitions and waivers by States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Governors' petition for  additional contaminants. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows Governors of  seven (7) or more States to petition the EPA Administrator to add one or  more contaminants to the UCMR Contaminant List in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section. The petition must clearly identify the reason(s) for  adding the contaminant(s) to the monitoring list, including the  potential risk to public health, particularly any information that might  be available regarding disproportional risks to the health and safety of  children, the expected occurrence documented by any available data, any  analytical methods known or proposed to be used to test for the  contaminant(s), and any other information that could assist the  Administrator in determining which contaminants present the greatest  public health concern and should, therefore, be included on the UCMR  Contaminant List in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State-wide waivers. A State can waive monitoring requirements  only with EPA approval and under very limited conditions. Conditions and  procedures for obtaining a waiver are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application. A State may apply to EPA for a State-wide waiver  from the unregulated contaminant monitoring requirements for PWSs  serving more   than 10,000 people. To apply for such a waiver, the State must submit an  application to EPA that includes the following information: The list of  contaminants on the UCMR Contaminant List for which a waiver is  requested, along with documentation for each contaminant in the request  demonstrating that the contaminants or their parent compounds do not  occur naturally in the State, and certifying that during the past 15  years they have not been used, applied, stored, disposed of, released,  or detected in the source waters or distribution systems in the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approval. EPA will review State applications and notify the  State whether it accepts or rejects the request. The State must receive  written approval from EPA before issuing a State-wide waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Incorporation by reference. These standards are incorporated by  reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the  Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
