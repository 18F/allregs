                                Sec. 404.1048  Contribution and benefit base after 1992.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The contribution and benefit base after 1992 is figured  under the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section in any  calendar year in which there is an automatic cost-of-living increase in  old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits. For purposes of  this section, the calendar year in which the contribution and benefit  base is figured is called the determination year. The base figured in  the determination year applies to wages paid after (and taxable years  beginning after) the determination year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Formula for figuring the contribution and benefit base. For  wages paid after (and taxable years beginning after) the determination  year, the contribution and benefit base is the larger of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contribution and benefit base in effect for the  determination year; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount determined by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Multiplying the contribution and benefit base in effect for the  determination year by the ratio of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The average of the total wages (as described in paragraph (c) of  this section) reported to the Secretary of the Treasury for the calendar  year before the determination year to</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The average of the total wages reported to the Secretary of the  Treasury for the calendar year before the most recent calendar year in  which an increase in the contribution and benefit base was enacted or a  determination under this section resulting in an increase of the base  was made; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rounding the result of the multiplication, if not a multiple of  $300, to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nearest multiple of $300; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The next higher multiple of $300 if the result is a multiple of  $150.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Average of the total wages. The average of the total wages means  the amount equal to all remuneration reported as wages on Form W-2 to  the Internal Revenue Service for all employees for income tax purposes  plus contributions to certain deferred compensation plans described in  section 209(k) of the Social Security Act (also reported on Form W-2),  divided by the number of wage earners. If both distributions from and  contributions to any such deferred compensation plan are reported on  Form W-2, we will include only the contributions in the calculation of  the average of the total wages. The reported remuneration and deferred  compensation contributions include earnings from work not covered under  social security and earnings from work covered under social security  that are more than the annual wage limitation described in  Sec. 404.1047.
