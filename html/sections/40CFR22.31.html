The final order shall resolve only those causes of action alleged in the complaint, or for proceedings commenced pursuant to Sec. 22.13(b), alleged in the consent agreement.

The respondent shall pay the full amount of any civil penalty assessed in the final order within 30 days after the effective date of the final order unless otherwise ordered.
