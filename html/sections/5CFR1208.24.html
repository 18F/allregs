                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election to terminate. At any time beginning on the 121st day  after an appellant files a VEOA appeal with the Board, if a judicially  reviewable Board decision on the appeal has not been issued, the  appellant may elect to terminate the Board proceeding as provided under  5 U.S.C. 3330b and file a civil action with an appropriate United States  district court. Such election must be in writing, signed, filed with the  Board office where the appeal is being processed, and served on the  parties. The election is effective immediately on the date of receipt by  the Board office where the appeal is being processed. The election may  be filed by electronic filing, provided the requirements of Sec. 1201.14  of this chapter are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination order. Following receipt by the Board of an  appellant's written election to terminate the Board proceeding, a  termination order will be issued to document the termination of the  proceeding. The termination order will state that the proceeding was  terminated as of the date of receipt of the appellant's written  election. Such an order is neither an initial decision under 5 CFR  1201.111 nor a final Board decision and is not subject to a petition for  review in accordance with subpart C of part 1201, a petition for  enforcement in accordance with subpart F of part 1201, or a petition for  judicial review.
