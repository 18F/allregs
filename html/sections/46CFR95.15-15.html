Drains and dirt traps shall be  located in accessible locations where possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Piping shall be used for no other purpose except that it may be  incorporated with the fire-detecting system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Piping passing through living quarters shall not be fitted with  drains or other openings within such spaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Installation test requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon completion of the piping installation, and before the  cylinders are connected, a pressure test shall be applied as set forth  in this paragraph. Only carbon dioxide or other inert gas shall be used  for this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold  shall be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch. With  no additional gas being introduced to the system, it shall be  demonstrated that the leakage of the system is such as not to permit a  pressure drop of more than 150 pounds per square inch per minute for a  2-minute period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The individual branch lines to the various spaces protected  shall be subjected to a test similar to that described in the preceding  paragraph with the exception that the pressure used shall be 600 pounds  per square inch in lieu of 1,000 pounds per square inch. For the purpose  of this test, the distribution piping shall be capped within the space  protected at the first joint ahead of the nozzles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In lieu of the tests prescribed in paragraphs (j) (1) through  (3) of this section, small independent systems protecting spaces such as  emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers, etc., may be tested by blowing  out the piping with air at a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square  inch.</p>
