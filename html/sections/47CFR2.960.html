                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission may recognize Telecommunication Certification  Bodies (TCBs) which have been designated according to requirements of  paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to issue grants of certification as  required under this part. Certification of equipment by a TCB shall be  based on an application with all the information specified in this part.  The TCB shall review the application to determine compliance with the  Commission's requirements and shall issue a grant of equipment  certification in accordance with Sec. 2.911.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the United States, TCBs shall be accredited and designated by  the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under its  National Voluntary Conformity Assessment Evaluation (NVCASE) program, or  other recognized programs based on ISO/IEC 17065 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 2.910) to comply with the Commission's qualification  criteria for TCBs. NIST may, in accordance with its procedures, allow  other appropriately qualified accrediting bodies to accredit TCBs. TCBs  shall comply with the requirements in Sec. 2.962 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with the terms of an effective bilateral or  multilateral mutual recognition agreement or arrangement (MRA) to which  the United States is a party, bodies outside the United States shall be  permitted to authorize equipment in lieu of the Commission. A body in an  MRA partner economy may authorize equipment to U.S. requirements only if  that economy permits bodies in the United States to authorize equipment  to its requirements. The authority designating these telecommunication  certification bodies shall meet the following criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The organization accrediting the prospective telecommunication  certification body shall be capable of meeting the requirements and  conditions of ISO/IEC 17011 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 2.910).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The organization assessing the telecommunication certification  body shall appoint a team of qualified experts to perform the assessment  covering all of the elements within the scope of accreditation. For  assessment of telecommunications equipment, the areas of expertise to be  used during the assessment shall include, but not be limited to,  electromagnetic compatibility and telecommunications equipment (wired  and wireless).
