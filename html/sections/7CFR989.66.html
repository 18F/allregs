                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standard raisins acquired by a handler which are designated as reserve tonnage and reserve tonnage transferred to a handler by the committee shall be held by him for the account of the committee and subject to the applicable restrictions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Each handler shall hold in storage all reserve tonnage acquired by him and all reserve tonnage transferred to him by the committee until he has been relieved of such responsibility by the committee either by delivery to the committee or otherwise. Such handler shall store such reserve tonnage raisins in natural condition without addition of moisture and in such manner as will maintain the raisins in the same condition as when he acquired them, except for normal and natural deterioration and shrinkage, and except for loss through fire, acts of God or other conditions beyond the handler's control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each handler shall hold in storage all reserve tonnage acquired by him and all reserve tonnage transferred to him by the committee until he has been relieved of such responsibility by the committee either by delivery to the committee or otherwise. Such handler shall store such reserve tonnage raisins in natural condition without addition of moisture and in such manner as will maintain the raisins in the same condition as when he acquired them, except for normal and natural deterioration and shrinkage, and except for loss through fire, acts of God or other conditions beyond the handler's control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reserve tonnage acquired by a handler or transferred to a handler by the committee shall be stored separate and apart from other raisins to such extent and identified in such manner as the committee shall specify in its rules and procedures with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each handler may, under the direction and supervision of the committee, substitute for any reserve tonnage raisins a like quantity of standard raisins of the same varietal type and of the same or more recent year's production. Each such handler shall give the committee reasonable advance notice of his intention to substitute, the exact location of the raisins for which substitution is to be made, and arrange with the committee a mutually satisfactory time for the substitution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The committee may, after giving reasonable notice, require a handler to deliver to it, or to anyone designated by it, at such handler's warehouse or at such other place as the raisins may be stored, part or all of the reserve tonnage raisins held by such handler. Reserve tonnage raisins delivered by any handler to the committee, or to any person designated by it, in the form of natural condition raisins shall in the aggregate be not more than 2 percent less than the average maturity level of all raisins such handler acquired during the applicable crop year. The committee may require that such delivery consist of natural condition raisins, or it may arrange for such delivery to consist of packed raisins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each handler shall, at all times, hold in his possession or under his control reserve tonnage referable to his acquisitions of standard raisins and reserve tonnage transferred to him by the committee, less any quantity of such reserve tonnage released to him by a change of percentages, delivered by him pursuant to instructions of the committee or sold to him by the committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reserve tonnage raisins delivered by any handler to the committee, or to any person designated by it, whether in the form of natural condition raisins or packed raisins shall meet the applicable minimum grade or grade and condition standards, except for normal and natural deterioration. The committee shall have the authority to require, in its discretion and at its expense, such

reinspection and certification of reserve pool tonnage raisins as it may deem necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event the committee offers to handlers reserve tonnage raisins for contract packing or for sale in export, as provided in Sec. 989.67, each handler shall be given the opportunity to pack or purchase his share of each offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Handlers shall be compensated for receiving, storing, fumigating, handling, and inspection of that tonnage of reserve raisins determined by the reserve percentage of a crop year and held by them for the account of the committee, in accordance with a schedule of payments established by the committee and approved by the Secretary. A box rental shall be paid by the committee to producers or handlers for boxes used in storing reserve tonnage raisins beyond the crop year of acquisition in accordance with a rental schedule established by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The handler compensation shall be reviewed annually and shall be paid, as to the amount determined to be earned and unpaid, as soon as practicable after the end of the second quarter of the crop year and quarterly thereafter. Any handler may request the committee, by registered or certified mail, at any time after June 1 of a crop year to remove or relocate reserve tonnage raisins of the current crop year which remain in his possession. At any time during a crop year, a handler may request removal or relocation of reserve tonnage of a prior crop year. In each instance, he may request that the committee provide the necessary containers for any such removal or relocation. When so requested as to current crop year raisins, the committee shall make the removal or relocation, the availability of containers, storage space and time of request permitting, by September 15 of the subsequent crop year, and as to raisins of the prior crop year, within 30 days, supplying the necessary containers if so requested. If the committee removes or relocates reserve raisins of the current crop year pursuant to a handler's request, and such raisins are released to him by September 15 of the subsequent crop year, the handler shall reimburse the committee for any costs incurred by it in such removal or relocation. If any handler requests removal or relocation of reserve raisins, the committee shall immediately give notice thereof to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to obtain loans, nonrecourse or otherwise, on any part of the reserve tonnage not subject to release as desirable free tonnage and to pledge or hypothecate the raisins on which such loans are obtained as security therefor: Provided, That in every such case, there shall be included in the loan agreement a provision to the effect that, in case the lender obtains possession or control of such raisins, he will dispose of them in such a manner as will not tend to defeat the objectives of this amended subpart. The net proceeds of any such loan shall be distributed by the committee pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The net proceeds from the disposition of reserve tonnage raisins of any varietal type shall be distributed by the committee to the respective producers, or their successor in interest thereto, on the basis of the volume of their respective contributions to the reserve tonnage of such varietal type. Distribution of the proceeds in connection with the reserve tonnage contributed by a nonprofit cooperative marketing association which has authority to market the raisins of its members and to allocate the proceeds therefrom to such members shall be made to such association. Advance or progress payments may be made by the committee, in conformity with the provisions of this paragraph, as sufficient funds become available.
