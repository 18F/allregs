                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> or (4) is exempt from  the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act even though his  employer also operates one or more establishments which are not exempt.  On the other hand, it may be stated as a general rule that if such an  employer employs an employee in the work of both exempt and nonexempt  establishments during the same workweek, the employee is not ``employed  by'' an exempt establishment during such workweek. It is recognized,  however, that employees performing an insignificant amount of such  incidental work or performing work sporadically for the benefit of  another establishment of their employer nevertheless, are ``employed  by'' their employer's retail establishment. For example, there are  situations where an employee of an employer in order to discharge  adequately the requirements of his job for the exempt establishment by  which he is employed incidentally or sporadically may be called upon to  perform some work for the benefit of another establishment. For example,  an elevator operator employed by a retail store, in performance of his  regular duties for the store incidentally may carry personnel who have a  central office or warehouse function. Similarly, a maintenance man  employed by such store incidentally may perform work which is for the  benefit of the central office or warehouse activities. Also, a sales  clerk employed in a retail store in one of its sales departments  sporadically may be called upon to release some of the stock on hand in  the department for the use of another store.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of the principles discussed in Sec. 779.310 and  in paragraph (a) of this section would not preclude the applicability of  the exemption to the employee whose duties require him to spend part of  his week in one exempt retail establishment and the balance of the week  in another of his employer's exempt retail establishments; provided that  his work in each of the establishments will qualify him as ``employed''  by such a retail establishment at all times within the individual week.  As an example, a shoe clerk may sell shoes for part of a week in one  exempt retail establishment of his employer and in another of his  employer's exempt retail establishments for the remainder of the  workweek. In that entire workweek he would be considered to be employed  by an exempt retail establishment. In such a situation there is no  central office or warehouse concept, nor is the employee considered as  performing services for the employer's business organization as a whole  since there is no period during the week in which the employee is not  ``employed by'' a single exempt retail establishment.</p><p class="depth2">Statutory Meaning of Retail or Service Establishment    Sec. 779.312  ``Retail or service establishment'', defined in section  13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2">The 1949 amendments to the Act defined the term ``retail or service  establishment'' in section 13(a)(2). That definition was retained in  section 13(a)(2) as amended in 1961 and 1966 and is as follows:  A ``retail or service establishment'' shall mean an establishment 75 per  centum of whose annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or  of both) is not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services  in the particular industry.   It is clear from the legislative history of the 1961 amendments to the  Act that   no different meaning was intended by the term ``retail or service  establishment'' from that already established by the Act's definition,  wherever used in the new provisions, whether relating to coverage or to  exemption. (See S. Rept. 145, 87th Cong., first session p. 27; H.R. 75,  87th Cong., first session p. 9.) The legislative history of the 1949  amendments and existing judicial pronouncements regarding section  13(a)(2) of the Act, therefore, will offer guidance to the application  of this definition.</p>
