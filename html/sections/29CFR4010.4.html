                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A contributing sponsor of a plan and each member of the  contributing sponsor's controlled group on the last day of the  information year is a filer with respect to an information year (unless  exempted under paragraph (c) of this section) if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any plan (including an exempt plan) maintained by the  members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group on the last day  of the information year, the funding target attainment percentage for  the plan year ending within the information year is less than 80  percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any member of the controlled group fails to make a required  installment or other required payment to a plan and, as a result, the  conditions for imposition of a lien described in ERISA section 303(k)  and Code section 430(k) have been met during the information year, and  the required installment or other required payment is not made within  ten days after its due date; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any plan maintained by a member of the controlled group has been  granted one or more minimum funding waivers under ERISA section 302(c)  and Code section 412(c) totaling in excess of $1 million, and as of the  end of the plan year ending within the information year, any portion  thereof is still outstanding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Funding target attainment percentage--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as  provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the funding target  attainment percentage for a plan for a plan year equals the funding  target attainment percentage as provided under ERISA section 303(d)(2)  and Code section 430(d)(2) determined as of the valuation date for the  plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance  elections. For purposes of determining the funding target attainment  percentage for a plan for the plan year, prefunding balances and funding  standard carryover balances must reflect any elections (or deemed  elections) under ERISA section 303(f) and Code section 430(f) that  affect the value of such balances as of the beginning of the plan year,  regardless of when the elections (or deemed elections) are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transition rule for plan years beginning before 2008. For plan  years beginning before 2008, the funding target attainment percentage  for a plan for the plan year is determined as the fraction (expressed as  a percentage), the numerator of which is the net transition plan assets  determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the denominator  of which is the plan's current liability determined using the highest  rate of interest allowable under Code section 412(l)(7) as of the  valuation date for the 2007 plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Net transition plan assets--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Net transition plan  assets for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are equal to  plan assets as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section  reduced by any credit balance in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> are determined under Code Section 412(c)(2) as in effect for  the plan year beginning in 2007, except that the value of plan assets  before subtracting the plan's funding standard account credit balance  described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section can neither be less  than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets nor greater than  110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation  date for that plan year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subtraction of credit balance. If a plan has a funding  standard account credit balance as of the valuation date for the plan  year beginning in 2007, that balance is subtracted from the asset value  described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section as of that valuation  date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Effect of funding standard carryover balance reduction for 2008  plan year. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, if,  for the plan year beginning in 2008, the employer has made an election  to reduce some or all of the funding standard carryover balance as of  the first day of that year in accordance with ERISA section 303(f) and  Code section 430(f), then the present value (determined as of the  valuation   date for the plan year beginning in 2007 using the valuation interest  rate for that plan year) of the amount so reduced is not treated as part  of the funding standard account credit balance when that balance is  subtracted from the asset value under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of this section  are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person is not a contributing sponsor of a plan (other than  an exempt plan) as of the last day of the information year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person has revenue for its fiscal year ending within the  controlled group's information year that is five percent or less of the  revenue of the person's controlled group for the fiscal year(s) ending  within the information year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The person has annual operating income for the fiscal year  ending within the controlled group's information year that is no more  than the greater of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five percent of the controlled group's annual operating income  for the fiscal year(s) ending within the information year, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $5 million.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The person has net assets at the end of the fiscal year ending  within the controlled group's information year that is no more than the  greater of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five percent of the controlled group's net assets at the end of  the fiscal year(s) ending within the information year, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $5 million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>'' shall apply  in its place as those provisions are in effect for plan years beginning  before 2008.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minimum funding waiver--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. For purposes of  Sec. 4010.4(a)(3), a portion of the minimum funding waiver for a plan is  considered outstanding unless prior to the plan year ending within the  information year the statutory amortization period has ended, or, as of  the valuation date for the plan year ending within the information year,  the amortization bases are deemed to be reduced to zero pursuant to  ERISA section 303(e)(5) and Code section 430(e)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. Company A sponsors Plan X, which received a minimum  funding waiver of $700,000 for the plan year ending December 31, 2004,  and another waiver of $500,000 for the plan year ending December 31,  2008. Assume that the amortization bases of the waivers are not reduced  to zero pursuant to ERISA section 303(e)(5) and Code section 430(e)(5),  and the waivers are therefore outstanding for the full five-year  statutory amortization period. Also, assume Company A has a calendar  information year. For the 2009 information year, Company A must report  under ERISA section 4010. However, for the 2010 information year,  Company A, assuming no other obligation to report under ERISA section  4010, is not required to report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certain plans to which special funding rules apply. The  provisions of sections 104, 105, 106, and 402(b) of the Pension  Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (dealing with plans of  certain rural cooperatives, certain plans affected by settlement  agreements with PBGC, certain plans of government contractors, and  certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline  caterers), are disregarded for purposes of this part, except that these  provisions are taken into account in determining the information to be  submitted under Sec. 4010.8(i) of this part (in connection with the  actuarial valuation report).
