                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory limitations. In accordance with sec. 24(c) of the Act,  each State is authorized to register a new end use product for any use,  or an additional use of a federally registered pesticide product, if the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a special local need for the use within the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use is covered by necessary tolerances, exemptions or other  clearances under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346  et seq.), if the use is a food or feed use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Registration for the same use has not previously been denied,  disapproved, suspended or cancelled by the Administrator, or voluntarily  cancelled by the registrant subsequent to issuance by the Administrator  of a notice of intent to cancel that registration, because of health or  environmental concerns about an ingredient contained in the pesticide  product, unless such denial, disapproval, suspension or cancellation has  been superseded by subsequent action of the Administrator; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The registration is in accord with the purposes of FIFRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of registrations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amendments to federal registrations.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1)(ii) through  (iv) of this section, States may register any new use of a federally  registered pesticide product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State may register any use of a federally registered product  for which registration of other uses of the product was denied,  disapproved, suspended, or cancelled by the Administrator, provided that  the State may register a use not considered by the Administrator in  reaching such a determination only after the State consults with  appropriate EPA personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a  State may register any use of a federally registered product for which  registration of some or all uses has been voluntarily cancelled by the  registrant, provided that a State may register such a use only after the  State has consulted with appropriate EPA personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A State may not register an amendment to a federally registered  manufacturing-use product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New products. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) and  subparagraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a State may issue  registrations to meet special local needs for the following types of new  end-use products:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A product which is identical in composition to a federally  registered product, but which has differences in packaging, or in the  identity of the formulator.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A product which contains the same active and inert ingredients  as a federally registered product, but in different percentages.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section, a product containing a new combination of active, or active and  inert, ingredients.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State may register a new product only if each of the active  ingredients in the new product is present because of the use of one or  more federally registered products and if each of the inert ingredients  in the new product is contained in a federally registered product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A State may not register a new manufacturing-use product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A State may register any use of a new product containing an  ingredient described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the new  product registration is for a formulation or a use not included in the  denial, disapproval, suspension, or cancellation, or if the federally  registered use was voluntarily cancelled without a prior notice of  intent to cancel by the Administrator. However, a formulation or use of  such a new product which was not considered by the Administrator during  such proceedings, or which was not the subject of a notice of intent to  cancel, may be registered by a State only after the State consults with  appropriate EPA personnel regarding the registration application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of State registration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State registration issued  under FIFRA sec. 24(c) which meets the conditions described in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and which is not disapproved by  the Administrator under Sec. 162.154, shall be considered a federal  registration, but shall authorize distribution and use only within that  State. Accordingly, such registrations are subject to all provisions of  FIFRA which apply to currently registered products, including provisions  for cancellation and suspension of registrations, and reregistration of  products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State may require, as a condition of distribution or use of a  pesticide product within the State, that the pesticide product be  registered under State law as well as under FIFRA. Neither FIFRA sec.  24(c) nor Sec. Sec. 162.150-162.156 affects a State's right under its  own law to revoke, suspend, cancel, or otherwise affect such a  registration issued under State law. However, the federal registration,  whether issued under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24(c), is not affected by such a  State action.  [46 FR 2014, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended at 73 FR 75597, Dec. 12, 2008]</p>
