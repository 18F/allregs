For all other districts, meetings of all producers shall be held for such purpose. A meeting of handlers representing cooperative marketing organizations and a meeting of independent handlers shall be held in the production area to elect nominees for handler members and alternates. For nominations to the initial committee, the meetings may be sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture or by any agency or group requested to do so by such Department. For nominations for succeeding members and alternates on the committee, the committee shall hold such meetings or cause them to be held prior to June 15 of each year, after the effective date of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At each such meeting at least one nomination shall be designated for each position as member and alternate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nominations for committee members and alternates following the initial committee shall be supplied to the Secretary not later than July 1 each year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In districts having both cooperative and independent producer members, only producers who market their fruit through cooperative marketing organizations may participate in designating nominees for members and alternates representing cooperative producers; and only independent producers may participate in designating nominees for members and alternates representing independent producers. In all other districts, all producers may participate in designating the nominees for producer members and alternates. Only handlers representing cooperative marketing organizations may participate in designating nominees for members and alternates representing cooperative handlers; and only independent handlers may participate in designating nominees for members and alternates representing independent handlers. In the event that a person is engaged in producing fruit in more than one district such person shall elect the district within which he may participate, as aforesaid, in designating nominees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Regardless of the amount of fruit handled by a handler or the number of districts in which a person produces fruit, each person is entitled to cast only one vote on behalf of himself, his agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives in designating nominees

for committee members and alternates. An eligible voter's privilege of casting only one vote shall be construed to permit a voter to cast one vote for each position to be filled. Votes must be cast in person at all nomination meetings.</p>
