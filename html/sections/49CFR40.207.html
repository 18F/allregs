Sec.  40.159(a)(5) and 40.187(b)(2), (c)(1), and (e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT  requirements (e.g., being applied toward the number of tests needed to  meet the employer's minimum random testing rate).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A cancelled DOT test does not provide a valid basis for an  employer to conduct a non-DOT test (i.e., a test under company  authority).
