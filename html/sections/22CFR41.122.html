                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for revocation by consular officers. A consular officer,  the Secretary, or a Department official to whom the Secretary has  delegated this authority is authorized to revoke a nonimmigrant visa at  any time, in his or her discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisional revocation. A consular officer, the Secretary, or  any Department official to whom the Secretary has delegated this  authority may provisionally revoke a nonimmigrant visa while considering  information related to whether a visa holder is eligible for the visa.  Provisional revocation shall have the same force and effect as any other  visa revocation under INA 221(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of revocation. Unless otherwise instructed by the  Department, a consular officer shall, if practicable, notify the alien  to whom the visa was issued that the visa was revoked or provisionally  revoked. Regardless of delivery of such notice, once the revocation has  been entered into the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System  (CLASS), the visa is no longer to be considered valid for travel to the  United States. The date of the revocation shall be indicated in CLASS  and on any notice sent to the alien to whom the visa was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure for physically canceling visas. A nonimmigrant visa  that is revoked shall be canceled by writing or stamping the word  ``REVOKED'' plainly across the face of the visa, if the visa is  available to the consular officer. The failure or inability to  physically cancel the visa does not affect the validity of the  revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Revocation of visa by immigration officer. An immigration  officer is authorized to revoke a valid visa by physically canceling it  in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this  section if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alien obtains an immigrant visa or an adjustment of status  to that of permanent resident;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien is ordered excluded from the United States under INA  236, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, or removed from the United  States pursuant to INA 235;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alien is notified pursuant to INA 235 by an immigration  officer at a port of entry that the alien appears to be inadmissible to  the United States, and the alien requests and is granted permission to  withdraw the application for admission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A final order of deportation or removal or a final order  granting voluntary departure with an alternate order of deportation or  removal is entered against the alien;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The alien has been permitted by DHS to depart voluntarily from  the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> DHS has revoked a waiver of inadmissibility granted pursuant to  INA 212(d)(3)(A) in relation to the visa that was issued to the alien;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The visa is presented in connection with an application for  admission to the United States by a person other than the alien to whom  the visa was issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The visa has been physically removed from the passport in which  it was issued; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The visa has been issued in a combined Mexican or Canadian B-1/ B-2 visa and border crossing identification card, and the immigration  officer makes the determination specified in Sec. 41.32(c) with respect  to the alien's Mexican citizenship and/or residence or the determination  specified in Sec. 41.33(b) with respect to the alien's status as a  permanent resident of Canada.
