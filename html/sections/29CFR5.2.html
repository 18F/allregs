                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term Secretary includes the Secretary of Labor, the Deputy  Under Secretary for Employment Standards, and their authorized  representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and  Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of  Labor, or authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term Federal agency means the agency or instrumentality of  the United States which enters into the contract or provides assistance  through loan, grant, loan guarantee or insurance, or otherwise, to the  project subject to a statute listed in Sec. 5.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term Agency Head means the principal official of the Federal  agency and includes those persons duly authorized to act in the behalf  of the Agency Head.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term Contracting Officer means the individual, a duly  appointed successor, or authorized representative who is designated and  authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of the Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term labor standards as used in this part means the  requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contract Work Hours and Safety  Standards Act (other than those relating to safety and health), the  Copeland Act, and the prevailing wage provisions of the other statutes  listed in Sec. 5.1, and the regulations in parts 1 and 3 of this  subtitle and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term United States or the District of Columbia means the  United States, the District of Columbia, and all executive departments,  independent establishments, administrative agencies, and  instrumentalities of the United States and of the District of Columbia,  including corporations, all or substantially all of the stock of which  is beneficially owned by the United States, by the foregoing  departments,   establishments, agencies, instrumentalities, and including  nonappropriated fund instrumentalities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term contract means any prime contract which is subject  wholly or in part to the labor standards provisions of any of the acts  listed in Sec. 5.1 and any subcontract of any tier thereunder, let  under the prime contract. A State or local Government is not regarded as  a contractor under statutes providing loans, grants, or other Federal  assistance in situations where construction is performed by its own  employees. However, under statutes requiring payment of prevailing wages  to all laborers and mechanics employed on the assisted project, such as  the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, State and local recipients of Federal-aid  must pay these employees according to Davis-Bacon labor standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The terms building or work generally include construction  activity as distinguished from manufacturing, furnishing of materials,  or servicing and maintenance work. The terms include without limitation,  buildings, structures, and improvements of all types, such as bridges,  dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers,  mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways,  airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys,  jetties, breakwaters, levees, canals, dredging, shoring, rehabilitation  and reactivation of plants, scaffolding, drilling, blasting, excavating,  clearing, and landscaping. The manufacture or furnishing of materials,  articles, supplies or equipment (whether or not a Federal or State  agency acquires title to such materials, articles, supplies, or  equipment during the course of the manufacture or furnishing, or owns  the materials from which they are manufactured or furnished) is not a  building or work within the meaning of the regulations in this part  unless conducted in connection with and at the site of such a building  or work as is described in the foregoing sentence, or under the United  States Housing Act of 1937 and the Housing Act of 1949 in the  construction or development of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The terms construction, prosecution, completion, or repair mean  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All types of work done on a particular building or work at the  site thereof, including work at a facility which is deemed a part of the  site of the work within the meaning of (paragraph (l) of this section by  laborers and mechanics employed by a construction contractor or  construction subcontractor (or, under the United States Housing Act of  1937; the Housing Act of 1949; and the Native American Housing  Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, all work done in the  construction or development of the project), including without  limitation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Altering, remodeling, installation (where appropriate) on the  site of the work of items fabricated off-site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Painting and decorating;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturing or furnishing of materials, articles, supplies  or equipment on the site of the building or work (or, under the United  States Housing Act of 1937; the Housing Act of 1949; and the Native  American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 in the  construction or development of the project);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transportation between the site of the work within the  meaning of paragraph (l)(1) of this section and a facility which is  dedicated to the construction of the building or work and deemed a part  of the site of the work within the meaning of paragraph (l)(2) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Transportation of portion(s) of the building or work between a  site where a significant portion of such building or work is  constructed, which is a part of the site of the work within the meaning  of paragraph (l)(1) of this section, and the physical place or places  where the building or work will remain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for laborers and mechanics employed in the construction  or development of the project under the United States Housing Act of  1937; the Housing Act of 1949; and the Native American Housing  Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, and except as provided in  paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the transportation of materials  or supplies to or from the site of the work by employees of the  construction contractor or a construction subcontractor is not  ``construction, prosecution, completion, or repair'' (see   Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO v. United States  Department of Labor Wage Appeals Board (Midway Excavators, Inc.), 932  F.2d 985 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term public building or public work includes building or  work, the construction, prosecution, completion, or repair of which, as  defined above, is carried on directly by authority of or with funds of a  Federal agency to serve the interest of the general public regardless of  whether title thereof is in a Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The term site of the work is defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The site of the work is the physical place or places where the  building or work called for in the contract will remain; and any other  site where a significant portion of the building or work is constructed,  provided that such site is established specifically for the performance  of the contract or project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (l)(3) of this section, job  headquarters, tool yards, batch plants, borrow pits, etc., are part of  the site of the work, provided they are dedicated exclusively, or nearly  so, to performance of the contract or project, and provided they are  adjacent or virtually adjacent to the site of the work as defined in  paragraph (l)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not included in the site of the work are permanent home offices,  branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, tool yards, etc., of a  contractor or subcontractor whose location and continuance in operation  are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal or  federally assisted contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants,  batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., of a  commercial or material supplier, which are established by a supplier of  materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the site of  the work as stated in paragraph (l)(1) of this section, are not included  in the site of the work. Such permanent, previously established  facilities are not part of the site of the work, even where the  operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively, or nearly  so, to the performance of a contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The term laborer or mechanic includes at least those workers  whose duties are manual or physical in nature (including those workers  who use tools or who are performing the work of a trade), as  distinguished from mental or managerial. The term laborer or mechanic  includes apprentices, trainees, helpers, and, in the case of contracts  subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, watchmen or  guards. The term does not apply to workers whose duties are primarily  administrative, executive, or clerical, rather than manual. Persons  employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional  capacity as defined in part 541 of this title are not deemed to be  laborers or mechanics. Working foremen who devote more than 20 percent  of their time during a workweek to mechanic or laborer duties, and who  do not meet the criteria of part 541, are laborers and mechanics for the  time so spent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The terms apprentice, trainee, and helper are defined as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apprentice means (i) a person employed and individually  registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the  U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office  of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or with a State  Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Bureau, or (ii) a person in the  first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an  apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the  program, but who has been certified by the Office of Apprenticeship  Training, Employer and Labor Services or a State Apprenticeship Agency  (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an  apprentice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trainee means a person registered and receiving on-the-job  training in a construction occupation under a program which has been  approved in advance by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and  Training Administration, as meeting its standards for on-the-job  training programs and which has been so certified by that  Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> These provisions do not apply to apprentices and trainees  employed on projects subject to 23 U.S.C. 113 who are enrolled in  programs which have   been certified by the Secretary of Transportation in accordance with 23  U.S.C. 113(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A distinct classification of ``helper'' will be issued in wage  determinations applicable to work performed on construction projects  covered by the labor standards provisions of the Davis-Bacon and Related  Acts only where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from  those of any other classification on the wage determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice  in the area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal  training program. A ``helper'' classification will be added to wage  determinations pursuant to Sec. 5.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) only where, in  addition, the work to be performed by the helper is not performed by a  classification in the wage determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Every person performing the duties of a laborer or mechanic in  the construction, prosecution, completion, or repair of a public  building or public work, or building or work financed in whole or in  part by loans, grants, or guarantees from the United States is employed  regardless of any contractual relationship alleged to exist between the  contractor and such person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The term wages means the basic hourly rate of pay; any  contribution irrevocably made by a contractor or subcontractor to a  trustee or to a third person pursuant to a bona fide fringe benefit  fund, plan, or program; and the rate of costs to the contractor or  subcontractor which may be reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide  fringe benefits to laborers and mechanics pursuant to an enforceable  commitment to carry out a financially responsible plan of program, which  was communicated in writing to the laborers and mechanics affected. The  fringe benefits enumerated in the Davis-Bacon Act include medical or  hospital care, pensions on retirement or death, compensation for  injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity, or insurance  to provide any of the foregoing; unemployment benefits; life insurance,  disability insurance, sickness insurance, or accident insurance;  vacation or holiday pay; defraying costs of apprenticeship or other  similar programs; or other bona fide fringe benefits. Fringe benefits do  not include benefits required by other Federal, State, or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The term wage determination includes the original decision and  any subsequent decisions modifying, superseding, correcting, or  otherwise changing the provisions of the original decision. The  application of the wage determination shall be in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1.6 of this title.
