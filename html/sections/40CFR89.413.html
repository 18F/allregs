It must be demonstrated that the flow rate through each individual sample line is [4 percent of the average flow rate through all the sample lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use another method, if it has been approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All gaseous heated sampling lines shall be fitted with a heated filter to extract solid particles from the flow of gas required for analysis. The sample line for CO and CO2 analysis may be heated or unheated.
