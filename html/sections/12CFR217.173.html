This should be</p><p class="depth0">done for each of the four category/subcategories. The Board-regulated institution must disclose any</p><p class="depth0">significant differences in approach to estimating these variables within each category/subcategories. \2\ The PD, LGD and EAD disclosures in Table 6 (c) to Sec. 217.173 should reflect the effects of collateral,</p><p class="depth0">qualifying master netting agreements, eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives as defined under</p><p class="depth0">this part. Disclosure of each PD grade should include the exposure-weighted average PD for each grade. Where a</p><p class="depth0">Board-regulated institution aggregates PD grades for the purposes of disclosure, this should be a</p><p class="depth0">representative breakdown of the distribution of PD grades used for regulatory capital purposes. \3\ Outstanding loans and EAD on undrawn commitments can be presented on a combined basis for these disclosures. \4\ These disclosures are a way of further informing the reader about the reliability of the information</p><p class="depth0">provided in the ``quantitative disclosures: Risk assessment'' over the long run. The disclosures are</p><p class="depth0">requirements from year-end 2010; in the meantime, early adoption is encouraged. The phased implementation is</p><p class="depth0">to allow a Board-regulated institution sufficient time to build up a longer run of data that will make these</p><p class="depth0">disclosures meaningful. \5\ This disclosure item is not intended to be prescriptive about the period used for this assessment. Upon</p><p class="depth0">implementation, it is expected that a Board-regulated institution would provide these disclosures for as long</p><p class="depth0">a set of data as possible--for example, if a Board-regulated institution has 10 years of data, it might choose</p><p class="depth0">to disclose the average default rates for each PD grade over that 10-year period. Annual amounts need not be</p><p class="depth0">disclosed. \6\ A Board-regulated institution must provide this further decomposition where it will allow users greater</p><p class="depth0">insight into the reliability of the estimates provided in the ``quantitative disclosures: Risk assessment.''</p><p class="depth0">In particular, it must provide this information where there are material differences between its estimates of</p><p class="depth0">PD, LGD or EAD compared to actual outcomes over the long run.
