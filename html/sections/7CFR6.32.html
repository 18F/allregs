Requests for consideration of such adjustments must be submitted to the Licensing Authority no later than September 1. The Licensing Authority will obtain prior consent for such an adjustment of licenses from the government of the exporting country for quantities in accordance with the Uruguay Round commitment of the United States.</p>
