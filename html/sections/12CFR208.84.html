                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Insurance disclosures. In connection with the initial purchase of an insurance product or annuity by a consumer from you, you must disclose to the consumer, except to the extent the disclosure would not be accurate, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The insurance product or annuity is not a deposit or other obligation of, or guaranteed by, the bank or an affiliate of the bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The insurance product or annuity is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other agency of the United States, the bank, or (if applicable) an affiliate of the bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an insurance product or annuity that involves an investment risk, there is investment risk associated with the product, including the possible loss of value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Credit disclosure. In the case of an application for credit in connection with which an insurance product or annuity is solicited, offered, or sold, you must disclose that the bank may not condition an extension of credit on either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The consumer's purchase of an insurance product or annuity from the bank or any of its affiliates; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consumer's agreement not to obtain, or a prohibition on the consumer from obtaining, an insurance product or annuity from an unaffiliated entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing and method of disclosures--(1) In general. The disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section must be provided orally and in writing before the completion of the initial sale of an insurance product or annuity to a consumer. The disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section must be made orally and in writing at the time the consumer applies for an extension of credit in connection with which insurance is solicited, offered, or sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions for transactions by mail. If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by mail, you are not required to make the oral disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section. If you take an application for credit by mail, you are not required to make the oral disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for transactions by telephone. If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by telephone, you may provide the written disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section by mail within 3 business days beginning on the first business day after the sale, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C 6103(a). If you take an application for such credit by telephone, you may provide the written disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section by mail, provided you mail it to the consumer within three days beginning the first business day after the application is taken, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Electronic form of disclosures. (i) Subject to the requirements of section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (12 U.S.C. 7001(c)), you may provide the written disclosures required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section through electronic media instead of on paper, if the consumer affirmatively consents to receiving the disclosures electronically and if the disclosures are provided in a format that the consumer may retain or obtain later, for example, by printing or storing electronically (such as by downloading).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any disclosures required by paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section that are provided by electronic media are not required to be provided orally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disclosures must be readily understandable. The disclosures provided shall be conspicuous, simple, direct, readily understandable, and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information provided. For instance, you may use the following disclosures, in visual media, such as television broadcasting, ATM screens, billboards, signs, posters and written advertisements and promotional materials, as appropriate and consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">NOT A DEPOSIT</p><p class="depth0">NOT FDIC-INSURED</p><p class="depth0">NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY</p><p class="depth0">NOT GUARANTEED BY THE BANK</p><p class="depth0">MAY GO DOWN IN VALUE</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disclosures must be meaningful. (i) You must provide the disclosures required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in a meaningful form. Examples of the types of methods that could call attention to the nature and significance of the information provided include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A plain-language heading to call attention to the disclosures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A typeface and type size that are easy to read;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Wide margins and ample line spacing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Boldface or italics for key words; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Distinctive type size, style, and graphic devices, such as shading or sidebars, when the disclosures are combined with other information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You have not provided the disclosures in a meaningful form if you merely state to the consumer that the required disclosures are available in printed material, but you do not provide the printed material when required and do not orally disclose the information to the consumer when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to those disclosures made through electronic media for

which paper or oral disclosures are not required, the disclosures are not meaningfully provided if the consumer may bypass the visual text of the disclosures before purchasing an insurance product or annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Consumer acknowledgment. You must obtain from the consumer, at the time a consumer receives the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, or at the time of the initial purchase by the consumer of an insurance product or annuity, a written acknowledgment by the consumer that the consumer received the disclosures. You may permit a consumer to acknowledge receipt of the disclosures electronically or in paper form. If the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are provided in connection with a transaction that is conducted by telephone, you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain an oral acknowledgment of receipt of the disclosures and maintain sufficient documentation to show that the acknowledgment was given; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Make reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgment from the consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Advertisements and other promotional material for insurance products or annuities. The disclosures described in paragraph (a) of this section are required in advertisements and promotional material for insurance products or annuities unless the advertisements and promotional materials are of a general nature describing or listing the services or products offered by the bank.</p>
