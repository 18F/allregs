                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where disputes between States and Indian Tribes arise as a  result of differing water quality standards on common bodies of water,  the lead EPA Regional Administrator, as determined based upon OMB  circular A-105, shall be responsible for acting in accordance with the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Regional Administrator shall attempt to resolve such  disputes where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The difference in water quality standards results in  unreasonable consequences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dispute is between a State (as defined in Sec. 131.3(j) but  exclusive of all Indian Tribes) and a Tribe which EPA has determined is  eligible to the same extent as a State for purposes of water quality  standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A reasonable effort to resolve the dispute without EPA  involvement has been made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requested relief is consistent with the provisions of the  Clean Water Act and other relevant law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The differing State and Tribal water quality standards have been  adopted pursuant to State and Tribal law and approved by EPA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A valid written request has been submitted by either the Tribe  or the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Either a State or a Tribe may request EPA to resolve any dispute  which satisfies the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. Written  requests for EPA involvement should be submitted to the lead Regional  Administrator and must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A concise statement of the unreasonable consequences that are  alleged to have arisen because of differing water quality standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A concise description of the actions which have been taken to  resolve the dispute without EPA involvement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A concise indication of the water quality standards provision  which has resulted in the alleged unreasonable consequences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Factual data to support the alleged unreasonable consequences;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement of the relief sought from the alleged unreasonable  consequences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where, in the Regional Administrator's judgment, EPA involvement  is appropriate based on the factors of paragraph (b) of this section,  the Regional Administrator shall, within 30 days, notify the parties in  writing that he/she is initiating an EPA dispute resolution action and  solicit their written response. The Regional Administrator shall also  make reasonable efforts to ensure that other interested individuals or  groups have notice of this action. Such efforts shall include but not be  limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notice to responsible Tribal and State Agencies, and  other affected Federal agencies,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice to the specific individual or entity that is alleging  that an unreasonable consequence is resulting from differing standards  having been adopted on a common body of water,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public notice in local newspapers, radio, and television, as  appropriate,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Publication in trade journal newsletters, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other means as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If in accordance with applicable State and Tribal law an Indian  Tribe and State have entered into an agreement that resolves the dispute  or establishes a mechanism for resolving a dispute, EPA shall defer to  this agreement where it is consistent with the Clean Water Act and where  it has been approved by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> EPA dispute resolution actions shall be consistent with one or a  combination of the following options:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mediation. The Regional Administrator may appoint a mediator to  mediate the dispute. Mediators shall be EPA employees, employees from  other Federal agencies, or other individuals with appropriate  qualifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the State and Tribe agree to participate in the dispute  resolution process, mediation with the intent to establish Tribal-State  agreements, consistent with Clean Water Act section 518(d), shall  normally be pursued as a first effort.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mediators shall act as neutral facilitators whose function is  to encourage communication and negotiation between all parties to the  dispute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mediators may establish advisory panels, to consist in part of  representatives from the affected parties, to study the problem and  recommend an appropriate solution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The procedure and schedule for mediation of individual disputes  shall be determined by the mediator in consultation with the parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If formal public hearings are held in connection with the  actions taken under this paragraph, Agency requirements at 40 CFR 25.5  shall be followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arbitration. Where the parties to the dispute agree to  participate in the dispute resolution process, the Regional  Administrator may appoint an arbitrator or arbitration panel to  arbitrate the dispute. Arbitrators and panel members shall be EPA  employees, employees from other Federal agencies, or other individuals  with appropriate qualifications. The Regional administrator shall select  as arbitrators and arbitration panel members individuals who are  agreeable to all parties, are knowledgeable concerning the requirements  of the water quality standards program, have a basic understanding of  the political and economic interests of Tribes and States involved, and  are expected to fulfill the duties fairly and impartially.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The arbitrator or arbitration panel shall conduct one or more  private or public meetings with the parties and actively solicit  information pertaining to the effects of differing water quality permit  requirements on upstream and downstream dischargers, comparative risks  to public health and the environment, economic impacts, present and  historical water uses, the quality of the waters subject to such  standards, and other factors relevant to the dispute, such as whether  proposed water quality criteria are more stringent than necessary to  support designated uses, more stringent than natural background water  quality or whether designated uses are reasonable given natural  background water quality.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Following consideration of relevant factors as defined in  paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the arbitrator   or arbitration panel shall have the authority and responsibility to  provide all parties and the Regional Administrator with a written  recommendation for resolution of the dispute. Arbitration panel  recommendations shall, in general, be reached by majority vote. However,  where the parties agree to binding arbitration, or where required by the  Regional Administrator, recommendations of such arbitration panels may  be unanimous decisions. Where binding or non-binding arbitration panels  cannot reach a unanimous recommendation after a reasonable period of  time, the Regional Administrator may direct the panel to issue a non- binding decision by majority vote.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The arbitrator or arbitration panel members may consult with  EPA's Office of General Counsel on legal issues, but otherwise shall  have no ex parte communications pertaining to the dispute. Federal  employees who are arbitrators or arbitration panel members shall be  neutral and shall not be predisposed for or against the position of any  disputing party based on any Federal Trust responsibilities which their  employers may have with respect to the Tribe. In addition, arbitrators  or arbitration panel members who are Federal employees shall act  independently from the normal hierarchy within their agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The parties are not obligated to abide by the arbitrator's or  arbitration panel's recommendation unless they voluntarily entered into  a binding agreement to do so.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a party to the dispute believes that the arbitrator or  arbitration panel has recommended an action contrary to or inconsistent  with the Clean Water Act, the party may appeal the arbitrator's  recommendation to the Regional Administrator. The request for appeal  must be in writing and must include a description of the statutory basis  for altering the arbitrator's recommendation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The procedure and schedule for arbitration of individual  disputes shall be determined by the arbitrator or arbitration panel in  consultation with parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If formal public hearings are held in connection with the  actions taken under this paragraph, Agency requirements at 40 CFR 25.5  shall be followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dispute resolution default procedure. Where one or more parties  (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) refuse to participate in  either the mediation or arbitration dispute resolution processes, the  Regional Administrator may appoint a single official or panel to review  available information pertaining to the dispute and to issue a written  recommendation for resolving the dispute. Review officials shall be EPA  employees, employees from other Federal agencies, or other individuals  with appropriate qualifications. Review panels shall include appropriate  members to be selected by the Regional Administrator in consultation  with the participating parties. Recommendations of such review officials  or panels shall, to the extent possible given the lack of participation  by one or more parties, be reached in a manner identical to that for  arbitration of disputes specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through  (f)(2)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dispute Resolution Mechanism means the EPA mechanism established  pursuant to the requirements of Clean Water Act section 518(e) for  resolving unreasonable consequences that arise as a result of differing  water quality standards that may be set by States and Indian Tribes  located on common bodies of water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties to a State-Tribal dispute include the State and the  Tribe and may, at the discretion of the Regional Administrator, include  an NPDES permittee, citizen, citizen group, or other affected entity.
