                            <p class="depth0">Each person who submits a notice must include the information  specified in the notice form to the extent it is known to or reasonably  ascertainable by the submitter. However, no person is required to  include information which relates solely to exposure of human or  ecological populations outside of the United States. The notice form  requires the following information relating to the manufacture,  processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the new  chemical substance:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific chemical identity of the substance that the  person intends to manufacture or import, which includes the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The currently correct Chemical Abstracts (CA) name for the  substance, based on the Ninth Collective Index (9CI) of CA nomenclature  rules and conventions, and consistent with listings for similar  substances in the Inventory. For each substance having a chemical  composition that can be represented by a specific, complete chemical  structure diagram (a Class 1 substance), a CA Index Name must be  provided. For each chemical substance that cannot be fully represented  by a complete, specific chemical structure diagram (a Class 2  substance), or if the substance is a polymer, a CA Index Name or CA  Preferred Name must be provided (whichever is appropriate based on CA  9CI nomenclature rules and conventions). In addition, for a Class 2  substance, the notice must identify the immediate chemical precursors  and reactants by specific chemical name and Chemical Abstracts Service  Registry Number (CASRN), if the number is available. Tradenames or  generic names of chemical precursors or reactants are not acceptable as  substitutes for specific chemical names.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The currently correct CASRN for the substance if a CASRN  already exists for the substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a Class 1 substance and for any Class 2 substance for  which a definite molecular formula is known or reasonably ascertainable,  the correct molecular formula.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For a Class 1 substance, a complete, correct chemical structure  diagram; for a Class 2 substance or polymer, a correct representative or  partial chemical structure diagram, as complete as can be known, if one  can be reasonably ascertained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a polymer, the submitter must also report the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific chemical name and CASRN, if the number is  available, of each monomer and other reactant used, at any weight  percent, to manufacture the polymer. Tradenames or generic names of  chemical reactants or monomers are not acceptable as substitutes for  specific chemical names.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The typical percent by weight of each monomer and other  reactant in the polymer (weight of the monomer or other reactant  expressed as a percentage of the weight of the polymeric chemical  substance manufactured), and the maximum residual amount of each monomer  present in the polymer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For monomers and other reactants used at 2 weight percent or  less (based on the dry weight of the   polymer manufactured), indicate on the PMN form any such monomers and  other reactants that should be included as part of the polymer  description on the Inventory, where the weight percent is based on  either (A) the weight of monomer or other reactant actually charged to  the reaction vessel, or (B) the minimum weight of monomer or other  reactant required in theory to account for the actual weight of monomer  or other reactant molecules or fragments chemically incorporated  (chemically combined) in the polymeric substance manufactured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For a determination that 2 weight percent or less of a monomer  or other reactant is incorporated (chemically combined) in a polymeric  substance manufactured, as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B) of  this section, analytical data or appropriate theoretical calculations  (if it can be documented that analytical measurement is not feasible or  not necessary) to support this determination must be maintained at the  site of manufacture or import of the polymer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Measured or estimated values of the minimum number-average  molecular weight of the polymer and the amount of low molecular weight  species below 500 and below 1,000 molecular weight, with a description  of how the measured or estimated values were obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The person must use one of the following two methods to develop  or obtain the specified chemical identity information reported under  paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section and must identify the method  used in the notice:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1. Obtain the correct chemical identity information  required by paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section directly from the  Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), specifically from the CAS Registry  Services Inventory Expert Service, prior to submitting a notice to EPA.  A copy of the chemical identification report obtained from CAS must be  submitted with the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2. Obtain the correct chemical identity information  required by paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) from any source. The notice will  be incomplete according to Sec. 720.65(c)(1)(vi) if the person uses  Method 2 and any chemical identity information is determined to be  incorrect by EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an importer submitting the notice cannot provide all the  information specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section  because it is claimed as confidential by the foreign supplier of the  substance, the importer must have the foreign supplier follow the  procedures in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and provide the correct  chemical identity information specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of  this section directly to EPA in a joint submission or as a letter of  support to the notice, which clearly references the importer's notice  and PMN User Fee Identification Number. The statutory review process  will commence upon receipt of both the notice and the complete, correct  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a manufacturer cannot provide all the information specified  in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section because the new chemical  substance is manufactured using a reactant having a specific chemical  identity claimed as confidential by its supplier, the manufacturer must  submit a notice directly to EPA containing all the information known by  the manufacturer about the chemical identity of the reported substance  and its proprietary reactant. In addition, the manufacturer must ensure  that the supplier of the confidential reactant submit a letter of  support directly to EPA providing the specific chemical identity of the  confidential reactant, including the CAS number, if available, and the  appropriate PMN or exemption number, if applicable. The letter of  support must reference the manufacturer's name and PMN User Fee  Identification Number under Sec. 700.45(c)(3) of this chapter. The  statutory review period will commence upon receipt of both the notice  and the letter of support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The impurities anticipated to be present in the substance by  name, CAS Registry number, and weight percent of the total substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Known synonyms or trade names of the new chemical substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A description of the byproducts resulting from the manufacture,  processing, use, and disposal of the new chemical substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The estimated maximum amount to be manufactured or imported  during the first year of production and the estimated maximum amount to  be manufactured or imported during any 12-month period during the first  three years of production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A description of intended categories of use by function and  application, the estimated percent of production volume devoted to each  category of use, and the percent of the new substance in the formulation  for each commercial or consumer use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For sites controlled by the submitter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identity of sites where the new substance will be  manufactured, processed, or used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A process description of each manufacture, processing, and use  operation which includes a diagram of the major unit operations and  chemical conversions, the identity and entry point of all feedstocks,  and the points of release of the new chemical substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Worker exposure information, including worker activities,  physical form of the new substance to which workers may be exposed, the  number of workers, and the duration of activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information on release of the new substance to the environment,  including the quantity and media of release and type of control  technology used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For sites not controlled by the submitter, a description of each  type of processing and use operation involving the new chemical  substance, including identification of the estimated number of  processing or use sites, situations in which worker exposure to and/or  environmental release of the new chemical substance will occur, the  number of workers exposed and the duration of exposure, and controls  which limit worker exposure and environmental release.
