If disposed of, it must be done in a manner that protects against the contamination of other animal food; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All animal food manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding is conducted under such conditions and controls as are necessary to minimize the potential for the growth of undesirable microorganisms to protect against the contamination of animal food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Raw materials and other ingredients:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be examined to ensure that they are suitable for manufacturing and processing into animal food and must be handled under conditions that will protect against contamination and minimize deterioration. In addition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shipping containers (e.g., totes, drums, and tubs) and bulk vehicles holding raw materials and other ingredients must be examined upon receipt to determine whether contamination or deterioration of animal food has occurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Raw materials must be cleaned as necessary to minimize contamination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Raw materials and other ingredients, including rework, must be stored in containers designed and constructed in a way that protects against contamination and deterioration, and held under conditions, e.g., appropriate temperature and relative humidity, that will minimize the potential for growth of undesirable microorganisms and prevent the animal food from becoming adulterated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Susceptible to contamination with mycotoxins or other natural toxins must be evaluated and used in a manner that does not result in animal food that can cause injury or illness to animals or humans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If frozen, must be kept frozen.
