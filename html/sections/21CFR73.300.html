                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive carrot oil is the liquid or the  solid portion of the mixture or the mixture itself obtained by the  hexane extraction of edible carrots (Daucus carota L.) with subsequent  removal of the hexane by vacuum distillation. The resultant mixture of  solid and liquid extractives consists chiefly of oils, fats, waxes, and  carrotenoids naturally occurring in carrots. The definition of carrot  oil in this paragraph is for the purpose of identity as a color additive  only and shall not be construed as setting forth an official standard  for carrot oil or carrot oleoresin under section 401 of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Color additive mixtures for food use made with carrot oil may  contain only those diluents listed in this subpart as safe and suitable  in color additive mixtures for coloring foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. Carrot oil shall contain no more than 25 parts  per million of hexane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. Carrot oil may be safely used for  coloring foods generally, in amounts consistent with good manufacturing  practice, except that it may not be used to color foods for which  standards of identity have been promulgated under section 401 of the act  unless the use of added color is authorized by such standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling requirements. The label of the color additive and any  mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring  purposes shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color  additive is not   necessary for the protection of the public health, and therefore batches  thereof are exempt from the certification requirements of section 721(c)  of the act.</p>
