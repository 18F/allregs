                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preferred evidence. Evidence of a common-law marriage must give  the reasons why the informant believes that a marriage exists. If the  information described in this paragraph is not furnished on a form  provided by the Board, it must be submitted in the form of a sworn  statement. Preferred evidence of a common-law marriage is one of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If both the husband and wife are alive, each shall sign a  statement and get signed statements from one blood relative of each. The  statement of another individual may be submitted for each statement the  husband or wife is unable to get from a relative. Each signed statement  should show--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the husband and wife believed they were married;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for this belief; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the husband and wife have presented themselves to the  public as husband and wife.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If either the husband or wife is dead, the surviving spouse  shall furnish a signed statement and signed statements from two blood  relatives of the dead spouse. The surviving spouse's statement should  show that he or she and the dead spouse believed themselves to be  married, the basis for this belief, and that they presented themselves  to the public as husband and wife. The statements from relatives of the  dead spouse should support the surviving spouse's statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If both husband and wife are dead, the applicant shall get a  signed statement from one blood relative of each dead spouse. Each  statement should show that the husband and wife believed themselves to  be married, the basis for this belief, and that they presented  themselves to the public as husband and wife.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Statements by relatives and other individuals described in  paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section are not required when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The husband and wife entered into a ceremonial marriage which  was void because of a legal impediment to the marriage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the impediment was removed, the husband and wife  continued to live together as man and wife until the employee filed an  application or one of them died; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A valid common-law marriage was established, under the law of  the State in which they lived, by their continuing to live together as  man and wife.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other evidence of common-law marriage. When preferred evidence  of a   common-law marriage cannot be obtained, the claimant will be asked to  explain the reason therefor and to furnish other convincing evidence of  the marriage.
