                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owner of the account. Funds held in a financial institution  account (including savings, checking, and time deposits also known as  certificates of deposit) are considered your resources if you own the  account and can use the funds for your support and maintenance. We  determine whether you own the account and can use the funds by looking  at how the account is held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individually-held account. If you are designated as the sole  owner by the account title and you can withdraw and use funds from that  account for your support and maintenance, all of that account's funds  are your resource regardless of the source. For as long as these  conditions are met, we presume that you own 100 percent of the funds in  the account. This presumption is not rebuttable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Jointly-held account. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are the only subsidy claimant  or subsidy recipient who is an account holder on a jointly held account,  we presume that all of the funds in the account belong to you. If more  than one subsidy claimant or subsidy recipient are account holders, we  presume that the funds in the account belong to those individuals in  equal shares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you disagree with the ownership presumption as described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you may rebut the presumption.  Rebuttal is a procedure which permits you to furnish evidence and  establish that some or all of the funds in a jointly-held account do not  belong to you.</p>
