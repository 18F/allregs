                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. SBA will charge fees for processing requests as  outlined in this section. Fees must be paid by check or money order made  payable to SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions and applicable fees. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct costs means those expenses that SBA actually incurs in  searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use  requesters, reviewing) documents in response to an FOIA request. Direct  costs include the salary of the employee performing the work and the  cost of operating duplication machinery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records  responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of information within records and also includes  reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records  maintained in electronic form or format. SBA may charge search fees even  if they fail to locate records or if   records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. Search fees  are $30 per hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication means the making of a copy of a record. Copies can  take the form of paper, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or electronic  records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. SBA will  charge $.10 per page for photocopy duplication and the actual cost for  other methods. SBA will honor a requester's specified preference of form  or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with  reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office  responding to the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review refers to the examination of documents responsive to a  request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from  disclosure. It includes processing any record for disclosure, e.g., all  necessary redaction and preparation for disclosure. It also includes  time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a  business submitter under Sec. 102.7, but does not include time spent  resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of  exemptions. Review costs are recoverable even if a record is ultimately  not disclosed. Only commercial use requesters are assessed review costs.  Review costs are $30 per hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf  of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his  or her commercial, trade or profit interests, which can include  furthering those interests through litigation. When it appears the  requester will put the requested records to a commercial use, either  because of the nature of the request itself or where SBA has reasonable  cause to doubt a requester's stated use, SBA will seek additional  clarification. SBA will charge commercial use requesters the full direct  costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the  records sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Educational institution means a state-certified preschool,  elementary or secondary school; an accredited college or university; an  accredited institution of professional education; or any accredited or  state-certified institution of vocational education that operates a  program of scholarly research. An educational institution requester must  show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of  a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a  commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research. SBA will  provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of  reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that  is not operated on a commercial basis, and that is operated solely for  the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are  not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A  noncommercial scientific institution requester must show that the  request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying  institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but  are sought to further scientific research. SBA will charge noncommercial  scientific institution requesters for the cost of reproduction alone  after the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A representative of the news media is a requester actively  gathering information for one or more news media who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is employed by a news medium or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has a reasonable expectation of selling the information  obtained to one or more news media. A news medium is an entity organized  and operated to distribute information to the general public. A news  medium may provide information by subscription and may target its  dissemination to a narrow section of the general public so long as any  member of the general public may purchase information from it. A request  for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester  shall not be considered to be for commercial use. A news media requester  must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the  auspices of a qualifying news medium and that the records are not sought  for a commercial use but are sought to further the dissemination of  information to the general public. SBA will provide documents to  representatives of the news media for the cost of reproduction   alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A member of the general public is a requester who does not fit  into any of the categories in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this  section. SBA will charge requesters in this category search time after  the first two hours and duplication after the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other charges. SBA will recover the full costs of providing  special services, such as certifying that records are true copies or  sending copies by other than ordinary mail, to the extent that SBA  elects to provide them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Charging interest. SBA will charge interest on any unpaid bill  starting on the 31st day following the date of billing. Interest charges  will accrue at the maximum rate allowed under 31 U.S.C. 3717. If still  unpaid by the 91st day after the billing date, SBA may notify consumer  credit reporting agencies of the delinquency and/or take other  appropriate action in accordance with law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fee waivers or reductions. SBA will furnish responsive records  without charge or at a reduced charge when a requester can show that  disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is  likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the  operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must submit a request for a fee waiver or reduction to the  initial processing office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the basis of the information that you provide, the initial  processing office will determine whether you meet the fee waiver  requirements outlined in this section.</p>
