                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An Am broadcast station may, without specific authority from the  FCC, transmit stereophonic programs upon installation of type accepted  stereophonic transmitting equipment and the necessary measuring  equipment to determine that the stereophonic transmissions conform to  the modulation characteristics specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section. Stations transmitting stereophonic programs prior to March  21, 1994 may continue to do so until March 21, 1995 as long as they  continue to comply with the rules in effect prior to March 21, 1994.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following limitations on the transmitted wave must be met to  insure compliance with the occupied bandwidth limitations, compatibility   with AM receivers using envelope detectors, and any applicable  international agreements to which the FCC is a party:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transmitted wave must meet the occupied bandwidth  specifications of Sec.  73.44 under all possible conditions of program  modulation. Compliance with requirement shall be demonstrated either by  the following specific modulation tests or other documented test  procedures that are to be fully described in the application for type  acceptance and the transmitting equipment instruction manual. (See Sec.   2.983(d)(8) and (j)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Main channel (L + R) under all conditions of amplitude  modulations for the stereophonic system but not exceeding amplitude  modulation on negative peaks of 100%.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stereophonic (L-R) modulated with audio tones of the same  amplitude at the transmitter input terminals as in paragraph (b)(i) of  this section but with the phase of either the L or R channel reversed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Left and Right Channel only, under all conditions of  modulation for the stereophonic system in use but not exceeding  amplitude modulation on negative peaks of 100%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective on December 20, 1994, stereophonic transmissions shall  conform to the following additional modulation characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The audio response of the main (L + R) channel shall conform to  the requirements of the ANSI/EIA-549-1988, NRSC-1 AM Preemphasis/ Deemphasis and Broadcast Transmission Bandwidth Specifications (NRSC-1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The left and right channel audio signals shall conform to  frequency response limitations dictated by ANSI/EIA-549-1988.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The stereophonic difference (L-R) information shall be  transmitted by varying the phase of the carrier in accordance with the  following relationship:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  where:  L(t) = audio signal left channel, R(t) = audio signal right channel, m = modulation factor, and mpeak(L(t) + R(t)) = 1 for 100% amplitude modulation, mpeak(L(t)-R(t)) = 1 for 100% phase modulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The carrier phase shall advance in a positive direction when a  left channel signal causes the transmitter envelope to be modulated in a  positive direction. The carrier phase shall likewise retard (negative  phase change) when a right channel signal causes the transmitter  envelope to be modulated in a positive direction. The phase modulation  shall be symmetrical for the condition of difference (L-R) channel  information sent without the presence of envelope modulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Maximum angular modulation, which occurs on negative peaks of  the left or right channel with no signal present on the opposite channel  (L(t)=-0.75, R(t) = 0, or R(t)=-0.75, L(t) = 0) shall not exceed 1.25  radians.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A peak phase modulation of 0.785 radians  under the condition of difference (L-R) channel modulation and the  absence of envelope (L + R) modulation and pilot signal shall represent  100% modulation of the difference channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The composite signal shall contain a pilot tone for indication  of the presence of stereophonic information. The pilot tone shall  consist of a 25 Hz tone, with 3% or less total harmonic distortion and a  frequency tolerance of  0.1 H2, which  modulates the carrier phase  0.05 radians peak,  corresponding to 5% L-R modulation when no other modulation is present.  The injection level shall be 5%, with a tolerance of + 1, -1%.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The composite signal shall be described by the following  expression:   [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  where:  A = the unmodulated carrier voltage m = the modulation index Csn = the magnitude of the nth term of the sum signal Cdn = the magnitude of the nth term of the difference signal [omega]sn = the nth order angular velocity of the sum signal [omega]dn = the nth order angular velocity of the difference</p><p class="depth3">signal [omega]c = the angular velocity of the carrier  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Asn and Bsn are the n\th\ sine and cosine</p><p class="depth3">coefficients of Csn Adn and Bdn are the n\th\ sine and cosine</p><p class="depth3">coefficients of Cdn  [58 FR 66301, Dec. 20, 1993]</p>
