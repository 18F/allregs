                            <p class="depth0">Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as  amended (``Act''), sets forth certain responsibilities of Federal  agencies in carrying out the purposes of the National Historic  Preservation Act of 1966. Subsection 110(j) authorizes the Secretary of  the Interior to promulgate regulations under which the requirements in  section 110 may be waived in whole or in part in the event of a major  natural disaster or an imminent threat to the national security. Waiver  of responsibilities under section 110 does not affect an agency's  section 106 responsibilities for taking into account the effects of  emergency activities on properties included in or eligible for the  National Register of Historic Places and for affording the Advisory  Council on Historic Preservation an opportunity to comment on such  activities.</p>
