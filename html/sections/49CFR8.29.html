                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Historical researchers. (1) Persons outside the executive branch who are engaged in historical research projects may have access to classified information provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons outside the executive branch who are engaged in historical research projects may have access to classified information provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Access to the information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person to be granted access is trustworthy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this paragraph apply only to persons who are conducting historical research as private individuals or under private sponsorship and do not apply to research conducted under Government contract or sponsorship. The provisions are applicable only to situations where the classified information concerned, or any part of it, was originated by the Department or its contractors, or where the information, if originated elsewhere, is in the sole custody of the Department. Any person requesting access to material originated in another agency or to information under the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will be referred to the other agency or to NARA, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a request for access to classified information for historical research is received, it will be referred to the appropriate local security office. That office will obtain from the applicant completed Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, in triplicate, and Standard Form 87, Fingerprint Chart; a statement in detail to justify access, including identification of the kind of information desired and the organization or organizations, if any, sponsoring the research; and a written statement (signed, dated, and witnessed) with respect to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the applicant will abide by regulations of the Department:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To safeguard classified information; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To protect information that has been determined to be proprietary or privileged and is therefore not eligible for public dissemination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the applicant understands that any classified information that the applicant receives affects the security of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the applicant acknowledges an obligation to safeguard classified information or privileged information of which the applicant gains possession or knowledge as a result of the applicant's access to files of the Department.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the applicant agrees not to reveal to any person or agency any classified information or privileged information obtained as a result of the applicant's access except as specifically authorized in writing by the Department, and further agrees that the applicant shall not use the information for purposes other than those set forth in the applicant's application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That the applicant agrees to authorize a review of the applicant's notes and manuscript for the sole purpose of determining that no classified information or material is contained therein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> That the applicant understands that failure to abide by conditions of this statement will constitute sufficient cause for canceling the applicant's access to classified information and for denying the applicant any future access, and may subject the applicant to criminal provisions of Federal law as referred to in this statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> That the applicant is aware and fully understands that title 18, United States Code, Crimes and Criminal Procedures, and the Internal Security Act

of 1950, as amended, title 50, United States Code, prescribe, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of information respecting the national security, and for loss, destruction, or compromise of such information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> That this statement is made to the U.S. Government to enable it to exercise its responsibilities for the protection of information affecting the national security.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> That the applicant understands that any material false statement that the applicant makes knowingly and willfully will subject the applicant to the penalties of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The security office will process the forms in the same manner as specified for a preappointment national agency check for a critical-sensitive position. Upon receipt of the completed national agency check, the security office, if warranted, may determine that access by the applicant to the information will be clearly consistent with the interests of national security and the person to be granted access is trustworthy. If deemed necessary, before making its determination, the office may conduct or request further investigation. Before access is denied in any case, the matter will be referred through channels to the Director of Security and Administrative Management for review and submission to the Personnel Security Review Board for final review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If access to TOP SECRET or intelligence or communications security information is involved a special background investigation is required. However, this investigation will not be requested until the matter has been referred through channels to the Director of Security and Administrative Management for determination as to adequacy of the justification and the consent of other agencies as required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When it is indicated that an applicant's research may extend to material originating in the records of another agency, approval must be obtained from the other agency prior to the grant of access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Approvals for access will be valid for the duration of the current research project but no longer than 2 years from the date of issuance, unless renewed. If a subsequent request for similar access is made by the individual within one year from the date of completion of the current project, access may again be granted without obtaining a new National Agency Check. If more than one year has elapsed, a new National Agency Check must be obtained. The local security office will promptly advise its headquarters security staff of all approvals of access granted under the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An applicant may be given access only to that classified information that is directly pertinent to the applicant's approved project. The applicant may review files or records containing classified information only in offices under the control of the Department. Procedures must be established to identify classified material to which the applicant is given access. The applicant must be briefed on local procedures established to prevent unauthorized access to the classified material while in the applicant's custody, for the return of the material for secure storage at the end of the daily working period, and for the control of the applicant's notes until they have been reviewed. In addition to the security review of the applicant's manuscript, the manuscript must be reviewed by appropriate offices to assure that it is technically accurate insofar as material obtained from the Department is concerned, and is consistent with the Department's public release policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Former Presidential appointees. Persons who previously occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the President may be granted access to classified information or material that they originated, reviewed, signed, or received, while in public office, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is determined that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person agrees to safeguard the information, to authorize a review of the person's notes to assure that classified information is not contained therein, and that the classified information will not be further disseminated or published.</p>
