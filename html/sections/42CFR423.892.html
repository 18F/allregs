                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Change of ownership. Any of the following constitutes a change of ownership:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partnership. The removal, addition, or substitution of a partner, unless the partners expressly agree otherwise as permitted by applicable State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Asset sale. Transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the sponsor to another party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Corporation. The merger of the sponsor's corporation into another corporation or the consolidation of the sponsor's organization with one or more other corporations, resulting in a new corporate body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of ownership, exception. Transfer of corporate stock or the merger of another corporation into the sponsor's corporation, with the sponsor surviving, does not ordinarily constitute change of ownership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advance notice requirement. A sponsor that has a sponsor agreement in effect under this part and is considering or negotiating a change in ownership must notify CMS at least 60 days before the anticipated effective date of the change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of agreement. When there is a change of ownership as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and this results in a transfer of the liability for prescription drug costs, the existing sponsor agreement is automatically assigned to the new owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions that apply to assigned agreements. The new owner to whom a sponsor agreement is assigned is subject to all applicable statutes and regulations and to the terms and conditions of the sponsor agreement.</p>
