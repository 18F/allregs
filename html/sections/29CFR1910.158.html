This section applies to all small hose, Class II, and Class III standpipe systems installed to meet the requirements of a particular OSHA standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. This section does not apply to Class I standpipe systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protection of standpipes. The employer shall assure that standpipes are located or otherwise protected against mechanical damage. Damaged standpipes shall be repaired promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equipment-(1) Reels and cabinets. Where reels or cabinets are provided to contain fire hose, the employer shall assure that they are designed to facilitate prompt use of the hose valves, the hose, and other equipment at the time of a fire or other emergency. The employer shall assure that the reels and cabinets are conspicuously identified and used only for fire equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reels and cabinets.

(i) The employer shall assure that every 1\1/2\ (3.8 cm) or smaller hose

outlet used to meet this standard is equipped with hose connected and ready for use. In extremely cold climates where such installation may result in damaged equipment, the hose may be stored in another location provided it is readily available and can be connected when needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer shall assure that every 1\1/2\ (3.8 cm) or smaller hose

Unlined hose may remain in use on existing systems. However, after the effective date of this standard, unlined hose which becomes unserviceable shall be replaced with lined hose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer shall provide hose of such length that friction loss resulting from water flowing through the hose will not decrease the pressure at the nozzle below 30 psi (210 kPa). The dynamic pressure at the nozzle shall be within the range of 30 psi (210 kPa) to 125 psi (860 kPa).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nozzles. The employer shall assure that standpipe hose is equipped with shut-off type nozzles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Water supply. The minimum water supply for standpipe and hose systems, which are provided for the use of employees, shall be sufficient to provide 100 gallons per minute (6.3 l/s) for a period of at least thirty minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tests and maintenance-(1) Acceptance tests. (i) The employer shall assure that the piping of Class II and Class III systems installed after January 1, 1981, including yard piping, is hydrostatically tested for a period of at least 2 hours at not less than 200 psi (1380 kPa), or at least 50 psi (340 kPa) in excess of normal pressure when such pressure is greater than 150 psi (1030 kPa).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acceptance tests.

This pressure shall be maintained for at least 15 seconds and not more than one minute during which time the hose shall not leak nor shall any jacket thread break during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance. (i) The employer shall assure that water supply tanks are kept filled to the proper level except during repairs. When pressure tanks are used, the employer shall assure that proper pressure is maintained at all times except during repairs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer shall assure that water supply tanks are kept filled to the proper level except during repairs. When pressure tanks are used, the employer shall assure that proper pressure is maintained at all times except during repairs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall assure that valves in the main piping connections to the automatic sources of water supply are kept fully open at all times except during repair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer shall assure that hose systems are inspected at least annually and after each use to assure that all of the equipment and hose are in place, available for use, and in serviceable condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When the system or any portion thereof is found not to be serviceable, the employer shall remove it from service immediately and replace it with equivalent protection such as extinguishers and fire watches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The employer shall assure that hemp or linen hose on existing systems is unracked, physically inspected for deterioration, and reracked using a different fold pattern at least annually.
