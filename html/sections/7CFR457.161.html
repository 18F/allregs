The cash price per pound for U.S. No. 2  grade canola that reflects the maximum limits of quality deficiencies  allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade canola.</p><p class="depth0">Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the  Basic Provisions, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil  surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated into  the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered  planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be insurable  unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial  documents, or by written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Price of damaged production. The cash price per pound available if  the production were sold for canola that qualifies for quality  adjustment in accordance with section 12 of these crop provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Rapeseed.

Replanting Payment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that  limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting,  the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance  with these Crop Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as specified in section 10(a)(1), you must comply with  all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13  of the Basic Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss  to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90  percent of the production guarantee for the acreage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to  achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that is  considered appropriate by agricultural experts for the insured crop,  type and practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount  of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of  the production guarantee or 175 pounds, multiplied by your projected  price, multiplied by your share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable  for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by  the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be  reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the acreage is replanted to an insured crop type that is  different than the insured crop type originally planted on the acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The production guarantee, premium, and projected price and  harvest price, as applicable, will be adjusted based on the replanted  type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replanting payments will be calculated using your projected  price and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and  insured; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the  replanted type, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">11.
