For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the following items are not treated as changing the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided in the contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A change in a temporary guarantee with respect to the amounts to be credited as interest to the policyholder's account, or charged as mortality, morbidity, or expense charges, if the new guarantee applies for a period of ten years or less;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of benefits on annuitization using rates which are more favorable to the policyholder than the permanently guaranteed rates; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other items as specified by the Commissioner in subsequent guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception for contracts restructured by a court supervised rehabilitation or similar proceeding. No amount is included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration with respect to any change made to the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of contracts of an insurance company that is the subject of a rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding. This treatment applies only if the change--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Occurs as part of the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is approved by the state court, the state insurance department, or other state official with authority to act in the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Value of the contract--(i) In general. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the value of the new contract is established through the most recent sale by the company of a comparable contract.

For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the value of the new contract is established through the most recent sale by the company of a comparable contract. If the value of the new contract is not readily ascertainable, the value may be approximated by using the interpolated terminal reserve of the original contract as of the date of the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for group term life insurance contracts. In the case of any exchange involving a group term life insurance contract without cash value, the value of the new contract is deemed to be zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for certain policy enhancement and update programs--(A) In general. If the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of a specified insurance contract are changed pursuant to a policy enhancement or update program, the value of the contract included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration equals 30 percent of the value determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of a specified insurance contract are changed pursuant to a policy enhancement or update program, the value of the contract included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration equals 30 percent of the value determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Policy enhancement or update program defined. For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, a policy enhancement or update program means any offer or commitment by the insurance company to all of the policyholders holding a particular policy form to change the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees used to determine the contract's nonforfeiture benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An individual (A) owns a life insurance policy issued by a life insurance company (L1). On January 1, 1993, A purchases additional term insurance for $250, which is added as a rider to A's life insurance policy. The purchase of the additional term insurance does not change the interest mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided by A's life insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's purchase of the term insurance rider is not considered to result in a fundamentally different contract under paragraph (c)(3) of this section because the addition of the rider did not change the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture values of A's original life insurance policy. Therefore, L1 includes only the $250 received from A in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amounts excluded from the gross amount of premiums and other consideration--(1) In general. The following items are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The following items are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items treated by section 808(e) as policyholder dividends that are paid to the policyholder and immediately returned to the insurance company as a premium on the same contract that generated the dividends, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A policyholder dividend applied to pay a premium under the contract that generated the dividend;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Excess interest accumulated within the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A policyholder dividend applied for additional coverage (for example, a paid-up addition, extension of the period for which insurance protection is provided, or reduction of the period for which premiums are paid) on the contract that generated the dividend;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A policyholder dividend applied to reduce premiums otherwise payable on the contract that generated the dividend;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An experience-rated refund applied to pay a premium on the group contract that generated the refund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> An experience-rated refund applied to a premium stabilization reserve held with respect to the group contract that generated the refund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Premiums waived as a result of the disability of an insured or the disability or death of a premium payor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Premiums considered to be paid on a contract as the result of a partial surrender or withdrawal from the contract, or as a result of the surrender or withdrawal of a paid-up addition previously issued with respect to the same contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amounts treated as premiums upon the selection by a policyholder or by a beneficiary of a settlement option provided in a life insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association. Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association relating to an insurance company that is subject to an insolvency, delinquency, conservatorship, rehabilitation, or similar proceeding are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion not to apply to dividend accumulations. For purposes of section 848(d)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, amounts applied from a dividend accumulation account to pay premiums on a specified insurance contract are not amounts treated as paid to, and immediately returned by, the policyholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Return premiums. For purposes of section 848(d)(1)(B) and this section, return premiums do not include policyholder dividends (as defined in section 808), claims or benefits payments, or amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement. For the treatment of amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Net consideration for a reinsurance agreement--(1) In general. For purposes of section 848, the ceding company and the reinsurer must treat amounts arising from the reinsurance of a specified insurance contract consistently in determining their net premiums. See paragraph (g) of this section for restrictions on the amount of the net negative consideration for any reinsurance agreement that may be taken into account. See paragraph (h) of this section for special rules applicable to reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 848, the ceding company and the reinsurer must treat amounts arising from the reinsurance of a specified insurance contract consistently in determining their net premiums. See paragraph (g) of this section for restrictions on the amount of the net negative consideration for any reinsurance agreement that may be taken into account. See paragraph (h) of this section for special rules applicable to reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net consideration determined by a ceding company--(i) In general. The net consideration determined by a ceding company for a reinsurance agreement equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The net consideration determined by a ceding company for a reinsurance agreement equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The gross amount incurred by the reinsurer with respect to the reinsurance agreement, including any ceding commissions, annual allowances, reimbursements of claims and benefits, modified coinsurance reserve adjustments under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, experience-rated adjustments, and termination payments; less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The gross amount of premiums and other consideration incurred by the ceding company with respect to the reinsurance agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net negative and net positive consideration. If the net consideration is less than zero, the ceding company has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the ceding company has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Net consideration determined by the reinsurer--(i) In general. The net consideration determined by a reinsurer for a reinsurance agreement equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The net consideration determined by a reinsurer for a reinsurance agreement equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section; less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net negative and net positive consideration. If the net consideration is less than zero, the reinsurer has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the reinsurer has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Timing consistency required. For purposes of determining the net consideration of a party for a reinsurance agreement, an income or expense item is taken into account for the first taxable year for which the item is required to be taken into account by either party. Thus, the ceding company and the reinsurer must take the item into account for the same taxable year (or for the same period if the parties have different taxable years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Modified coinsurance and funds-withheld reinsurance agreements--(i) In general. In the case of a modified coinsurance or funds-withheld reinsurance agreement, the net consideration for the agreement includes the amount of any payments or reserve adjustments, as well as any related loan transactions between the ceding company and the reinsurer. The amount of any investment income transferred between the parties as the result of a reserve adjustment or loan transaction is treated as an item of consideration under the reinsurance agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a modified coinsurance or funds-withheld reinsurance agreement, the net consideration for the agreement includes the amount of any payments or reserve adjustments, as well as any related loan transactions between the ceding company and the reinsurer. The amount of any investment income transferred between the parties as the result of a reserve adjustment or loan transaction is treated as an item of consideration under the reinsurance agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain funds-withheld reinsurance agreements. In the case of a funds-withheld reinsurance agreement that is entered into after November 14, 1991, but before the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, and is terminated before January 1, 1995, the parties' net consideration in the year of termination must include the amount of the original reserve for any reinsured specified insurance contract that, in applying the provisions of subchapter L, was treated as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance for the taxable year in which the agreement became effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Treatment of retrocessions. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a retrocession agreement is treated as a separate reinsurance agreement. The party that is relieved of liability under a retrocession agreement is treated as the ceding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Mixed reinsurance agreement. If a reinsurance agreement includes more than one category of specified insurance contracts (or specified insurance contracts and contracts that are not specified insurance contracts), the portion of the agreement relating to each category of reinsured specified insurance contracts is treated as a separate agreement. The portion of the agreement relating to reinsured contracts that are not specified insurance contracts is similarly treated as a separate agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Treatment of policyholder loans. For purposes of determining the net consideration under a reinsurance agreement, the transfer of a policyholder loan receivable is treated as an item of consideration under the agreement. The interest credited with respect to a policyholder loan receivable is treated as investment income earned directly by the party holding the receivable. The amounts taken into account as claims and benefit reimbursements under the agreement must be determined without reduction for the policyholder loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 1992, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under an agreement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholders under the contracts reinsured. L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the assumption reinsurance agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $100,000 for assuming the life insurance contracts, and L2 agrees to pay L1 a $17,000 ceding commission. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, L1 has net negative consideration of ($83,000) ($17,000 ceding commission incurred by L2--$100,000 incurred by L1 for reinsurance). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, L2 has net positive consideration of $83,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On July 1, 1992, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under an agreement whereby L1 remains liable to the policyholders under the reinsured contracts.

L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the indemnity reinsurance agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $100,000 for reinsuring the life insurance contracts, and L2 agrees to pay L1 a $17,000 ceding commission. L1 agrees to pay L2 an amount equal to the future premiums on the reinsured contracts. L2 agrees to indemnify L1 for claims and benefits and administrative expenses incurred by L1 while the reinsurance agreement is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the period beginning July 1, 1992, and ending December 31, 1992, the following income and expense items are determined with respect to the reinsured contracts:

L2's net negative consideration is ($57,000). L1 includes the net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1993, an insurance company (L1) enters into a modified coinsurance agreement with another insurance company (L2), covering a block of individual life insurance contracts. Both L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the agreement, L2 is credited with an initial reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts at the inception of the agreement, any new premiums received with respect to the reinsured contracts, any decrease in L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts, and an amount of investment income determined by reference to L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts. L2 is charged for all claims and expenses incurred with respect to the reinsured contracts plus an amount reflecting any increase in L1's reserves. The agreement further provides that cash settlements between the parties are made at the inception and termination of the agreement, as well as at the end of each calendar year while the agreement is in effect. The cash settlement is determined by netting the sum of the amounts credited to L2 against the sum of the amounts charged to L2 with respect to the reinsured policies. L1's reserves on the reinsured policies at the inception of the reinsurance agreement are $375,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the cash settlement formula, L2 is credited with an initial reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the reinsured policies ($375,000), but is charged an amount reflecting L1's policy reserve requirements ($375,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For the period ending December 31, 1993, L2 is also credited and charged the following amounts with respect to the reinsured contracts.

with respect to the contracts. As part of the agreement, L2 makes a loan to L1 equal to the amount of the reserves on the reinsured contracts. L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts on the effective date of the agreement are $375,000.

Therefore, L2 takes into account $45,000 ($25,000+$20,000=$45,000) as reimbursements for death benefits, and $20,000 ($5,000+$15,000=$20,000) as reimbursements for surrender benefits. After adjustment for these items, L2 has net positive consideration of $27,000, which is determined by subtracting the sum of the amounts charged to L2 ($45,000+$20,000+$8,000=$73,000) from the sum of the amounts credited to L2 ($100,000). L1 has net negative consideration of ($27,000) under the agreement. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the $27,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net negative foreign capitalization amount, the negative amount reduces (but not below zero) the unamortized balances of the amounts previously capitalized (beginning with the amount capitalized for the most recent taxable year) to the extent attributable to prior years' net positive foreign capitalization amounts. The amount by which previously capitalized amounts is reduced is allowed as a deduction for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover of remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount. The net negative foreign capitalization amount, if any, remaining after the reduction described in paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section is carried over to reduce a future net positive capitalization amount. The remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount may only offset a net positive foreign capitalization amount in a future year, and may not be used to reduce the amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848(a) for the taxable year, or to reduce the unamortized balances of specified policy acquisition expenses from preceding taxable years, with respect to directly written business or reinsurance agreements other than agreements for which the election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reduction of net positive foreign capitalization amount by carryover amounts allowed. If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount, that amount is reduced (but not below zero) by any carryover of net negative foreign capitalization amounts from preceding taxable years. Any remaining net positive foreign capitalization amount is taken into account as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (h) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1993, a life insurance company (L1) enters into a reinsurance agreement with a foreign corporation (X) covering a block of annuity contracts issued to residents of the United States. X is not subject to taxation either directly under subchapter L or indirectly under subpart F on the premiums for the reinsurance agreement with L1. L1 makes the election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for the taxable year with respect to

parties not subject to United States taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the taxable year ended December 31, 1993, L1 has net negative consideration of ($25,000) under its reinsurance agreement with X. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, L1's net negative foreign capitalization amount for the 1993 taxable year equals ($437.50), which is determined by multiplying L1's net negative consideration on the agreement with X ($25,000) by the percentage in section 848(c)(1) for the reinsured specified insurance contracts (1.75%). Under paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, L1 carries over the net negative foreign capitalization amount of $437.50) to future taxable years. The net negative foreign capitalization amount may not be used to reduce the amounts which L1 is required to capitalize on directly written business or reinsurance agreements other than those agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1 except that L1 terminates its reinsurance agreement with X and receives $35,000 on December 31, 1994. For the 1994 taxable year, L1 has net positive consideration of $35,000 under its agreement with X. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, L1's net positive net foreign capitalization amount for the 1984 taxable year equals $612.50, which is determined by multiplying the net positive consideration on the agreement with X ($35,000) by the percentage in section 848(c)(1) for the reinsured specified insurance contracts (1.75%). Under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, L1 reduces the net positive foreign capitalization amount for the taxable year by the net negative foreign capitalization amount carried over from preceding taxable years ($437.50). After this reduction, L1 includes $175 ($612.50-$437.50) as specified policy acquisition expenses for the 1994 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount--(1) In general. This paragraph (i) authorizes a carryover of an excess negative capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) to reduce amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848.

This paragraph (i) authorizes a carryover of an excess negative capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) to reduce amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848. Paragraph (i)(4) provides special rules for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess negative capitalization amount. The excess negative capitalization amount with respect to a category of specified insurance contracts for a taxable year is equal to the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The negative capitalization amount with respect to that category; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount that can be utilized under section 848(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of excess negative capitalization amount.

This paragraph (i)(4) applies only for the taxable year in which an insolvent insurance company has an excess negative capitalization amount and has net negative consideration under a reinsurance agreement. See paragraph (i)(4)(v) of this section for the definition of ``insolvent.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When applicable. This paragraph (i)(4) applies only for the taxable year in which an insolvent insurance company has an excess negative capitalization amount and has net negative consideration under a reinsurance agreement. See paragraph (i)(4)(v) of this section for the definition of ``insolvent.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election to forego carryover of excess negative capitalization amount. At the joint election of the insolvent insurance company and the other party to the reinsurance agreement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The insolvent insurance company reduces the excess negative capitalization amount which would otherwise be carried over under paragraph (i)(1) of this section by the amount determined under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The other party reduces the amount of its specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year by the amount determined under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount of reduction to the excess negative capitalization amount and specified policy acquisition expenses.

To make an election under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, each party to the reinsurance agreement must attach an election statement to its federal income tax return (including an amended return) for the taxable year for which the election is effective. The election statement must identify the reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under this paragraph (i)(4) has been made, state the amount of the reduction to the insolvent insurance company's excess negative capitalization amount that is attributable to the agreement, and be signed by both parties. An election under this paragraph (i)(4) is effective for the taxable year specified in the election statement, and may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Presumptions relating to the insolvency of an insurance company undergoing a court supervised rehabilitation or similar state proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), an insurance company which is undergoing a rehabilitation, conservatorship, or similar state proceeding shall be presumed to be insolvent if the state proceeding results in--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An order of the state court finding that the fair market value of the insurance company's assets is less than its liabilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The use of funds, guarantees, or reinsurance from a guaranty association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A reduction of the policyholders' available account balances; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A substantial limitation on access to funds (for example, a partial or total moratorium on policyholder withdrawals or surrenders that applies for a period of 5 years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Example. The principles of this paragraph (i)(4) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An insurance company (L1) is the subject of a rehabilitation proceeding under the supervision of a state court. The state court has made a finding that the fair market value of L1's assets is less than its liabilities. On December 31, 1993, L1 transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an assumption reinsurance agreement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholders under the contracts reinsured. Under the agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $2,000,000 for assuming the life insurance contracts. This negative net consideration causes L1 to incur an excess negative capitalization amount of $138,600 for the 1993 taxable year. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As part of the reinsurance agreement, L1 and L2 agree to make an election under paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Under the election, L1 agrees to forgo the carryover of the $138,600 excess negative capitalization amount for future taxable years. L2 must include the $2,000,000 net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration. L2 reduces its specified policy acquisition expenses for the 1993 taxable year by $138,600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Ceding commissions with respect to reinsurance of contracts other than specified insurance contracts. A ceding commission incurred with respect to the reinsurance of an insurance contract that is not a specified insurance contract is not subject to the provisions of section 848(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective dates--(1) In general. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction in the amount of net negative consideration to ensure consistency of capitalization for reinsurance agreements. Section 1.848-2(g) (which provides for an adjustment to ensure consistency) is effective for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, without regard to the date on which the reinsurance agreement was entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Net consideration rules. Section 1.848-2(f) (which provides rules for determining the net consideration for a reinsurance agreement) applies to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, under a reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994, under a reinsurance agreement entered into before November 15, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination of the date on which a reinsurance agreement is entered into.

The election and special rules in paragraph (h) of this section relating to the determination of amounts required to be capitalized on reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation apply to taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount. The provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, including the special rule for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies, are affected with respect to amounts arising in taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.
