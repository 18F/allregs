                                Sec. 300.115  Regional Response Teams.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response  actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of  oil, preparedness activities will be carried out in conjunction with  Area Committees, as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels  that of the NRT, as described in Sec. 300.110, but also includes state  and local representation. The RRT provides:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate regional mechanism for development and  coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is  taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC/RPM  during such response actions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter- area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and  NCP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing  team, which consists of designated representatives from each  participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments  (as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from  the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident- specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to  the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard  federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the  Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of  the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures,  planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related  matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area  Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions,  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the  operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge or  release. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the  incident-specific RRT, including participation by state and local  governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the  incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the  designated OSC/RPM. The designated OSC/RPM directs response efforts and  coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs  of RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for  response actions, the chair shall be the member agency providing the  OSC/RPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each participating agency should designate one member and at  least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional  subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may  designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure  appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating  states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member  to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange for representation  with the RRT appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies  and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to  meetings of the RRT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from  their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT  work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of  the OSCs/RPMs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide  OSCs/   RPMs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate  with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the  region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to  make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC/RPM as  specified in the RCP and ACP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified  representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and  maintaining ACPs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all  RRT activities. Each state governor is requested to assign an office or  agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate  representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for,  make available, and coordinate state resources; and to serve as the  contact point for coordination of response with local government  agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT  representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission  (SERC), described in Sec. 300.205(d), apprised of RRT activities and  coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited  to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state  law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also  invited to participate in such activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional  response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the  preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs  for the federal response to discharges and releases, and provide  technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT  should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local  emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation,  implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local  emergency planning committee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges or releases  on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment  readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and  private organizations, and recommend improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations  of response operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Encourage the state and local response community to improve its  preparedness for response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In coordination with Area Committees and in accordance with any  applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning  for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting  agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents  in accordance with subpart J of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or  releases outside the region;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to  encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the  region;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried  out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend  changes in ACPs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a  year, no later than January 31 and July 31. At a minimum, reports should  summarize recent activities, organizational changes, operational  concerns, and efforts to improve state and local coordination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program  for announced and unannounced exercises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific  response team when a discharge or release:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC/RPM in the  place where it occurs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transects state boundaries;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare  of the United States or the environment, or to regionally significant  amounts of property; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is a worst case discharge, as described in Sec. 300.324. RCPs  shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The RRT will be activated during any discharge or release upon a  request from the OSC/RPM, or from any RRT representative, to the chair  of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in  writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be  notified immediately when the RRT is activated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not  need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited  sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the  RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency  representatives shall meet at the call of the chair and may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM, advise the OSC/ RPM on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC/RPM  specific actions to respond to the discharge or release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private  agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to  respond to a discharge or release or to monitor response operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Help the OSC/RPM prepare information releases for the public  and for communication with the NRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the  regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC/RPM that a  different OSC/RPM should be designated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments  occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may  provide facilities and personnel for communications, information  storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location  of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in  all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in  the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair  determines that the OSC/RPM no longer requires RRT assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation  is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or  other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential  concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of  regionwide response effectiveness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a  matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question  concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary  actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level,  it may be referred to the NRT, described in Sec. 300.110, for advice.</p>
