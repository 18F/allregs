                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who believes that he, she or it would be damaged by the registration of a mark on the Principal Register may file in the Office a written request, addressed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, to extend the time for filing an opposition. The written request need not be verified, but must be signed by the potential opposer or by the potential opposer's attorney, as specified in Sec.  11.1 of this chapter, or authorized representative, as specified in Sec.  11.14(b) of this chapter. Electronic signatures pursuant to Sec.  2.193(c) are required for electronically filed extension requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written request to extend the time for filing an opposition to an application filed under section 1 or 44 of the Act must be filed either on paper or through ESTTA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written request to extend the time for filing an opposition to an application filed under section 66(a) of the Act must be filed through ESTTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A written request to extend the time for filing an opposition must identify the potential opposer with reasonable certainty. Any opposition filed during an extension of time should be in the name of the person to whom the extension was granted. An opposition may be accepted if the person in whose name the extension was requested was misidentified through mistake or if the opposition is filed in the name of a person in privity with the person who requested and was granted the extension of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The time for filing an opposition shall not be extended beyond 180 days from the date of publication. Any request to extend the time for filing an opposition must be filed before thirty days have expired from the date of publication or before the expiration of a previously granted extension of time, as appropriate. Requests to extend the time for filing an opposition must be filed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A person may file a first request for either a thirty-day extension of time, which will be granted upon request, or a ninety-day extension of time, which will be granted only for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a person was granted a thirty-day extension of time, that person may file a request for an additional sixty-day extension of time, which will be granted only for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After receiving one or two extensions of time totaling ninety days, a person may file one final request for an extension of time for an additional sixty days. The Board will grant this request only upon written consent or stipulation signed by the applicant or its authorized representative, or a written request by the potential opposer or its authorized representative stating that the applicant or its authorized representative has consented to the request, or a showing of extraordinary circumstances. No further extensions of time to file an opposition will be granted under any circumstances.
