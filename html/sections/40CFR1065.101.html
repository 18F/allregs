                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart specifies equipment, other than measurement  instruments, related to emission testing. The provisions of this subpart  apply for all engine dynamometer testing where engine speeds and loads  are controlled to follow a prescribed duty cycle. See subpart J of this  part to determine which of the provisions of this subpart apply for  field testing. This equipment includes three broad categories- dynamometers, engine fluid systems (such as fuel and intake-air  systems), and emission-sampling hardware.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other related subparts in this part identify measurement  instruments (subpart C), describe how to evaluate the performance of  these instruments (subpart D), and specify engine fluids and analytical  gases (subpart H).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subpart J of this part describes additional equipment that is  specific to field testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Figures 1 and 2 of this section illustrate some of the possible  configurations of laboratory equipment. These figures are schematics  only; we do not require exact conformance to them. Figure 1 of this  section illustrates the equipment specified in this subpart and gives  some references to sections in this subpart. Figure 2 of this section  illustrates some of the possible configurations of a full-flow dilution,  constant-volume sampling (CVS) system. Not all possible CVS  configurations are shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Dynamometer testing involves engine operation over speeds and  loads that are controlled to a prescribed duty cycle. Field testing  involves measuring emissions over normal in-use operation of a vehicle  or piece of equipment. Field testing does not involve operating an  engine over a prescribed duty cycle.
