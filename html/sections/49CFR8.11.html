                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Executive Order 12958 confers upon the Secretary of Transportation the authority to originally classify information as SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL with further authorization to delegate this authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following delegations of authority originally to classify information as ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'', which may not be redelegated, are hereby made:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The Deputy Secretary; Assistant Secretary for Administration; Director of Intelligence and Security; Director of Security and Administrative Management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal Aviation Administration. Administrator; Assistant Administrator for Security and Hazardous Materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maritime Administration. Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Although the delegations of authority set out in paragraph (b) of this section are expressed in terms of positions, the authority is personal and is invested only in the individual occupying the position. The authority may not be exercised ``by direction of'' a designated official. The formal appointment or assignment of an individual to one of the identified positions or a designation in writing to act in the absence of one of these officials, however, conveys the authority originally to classify information as ``SECRET''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Previous delegations and redelegations of authority within the Department of Transportation originally to classify information are hereby rescinded.
