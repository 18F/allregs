                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An intended registrant must submit a Department of State form DS-2032 (Statement of Registration) to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance by following the submission guidelines available on the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Web site at www.pmddtc.state.gov. The Statement of Registration must be signed by a U.S. person senior officer (e.g., chief executive officer, president, secretary, partner, member, treasurer, general counsel) who has been empowered by the intended registrant to sign such documents, with the exception that a foreign senior officer may sign the Statement of Registration if the intended registrant seeks only to register as a foreign broker. The Statement of Registration may include subsidiaries and affiliates when more than 50 percent of the voting securities are owned by the registrant or the subsidiaries and affiliates are otherwise controlled by the registrant (see Sec. 120.40 of this subchapter). The intended registrant, whether a U.S. or foreign person, shall submit documentation that demonstrates it is incorporated or otherwise authorized to do business in its respective country. Foreign persons who are required to register shall provide information that is substantially similar in content to that which a U.S. person would provide under this provision (e.g., foreign business license or similar authorization to do business). The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls will notify the registrant if the Statement of Registration (form DS-2032) is incomplete either by notifying the registrant of what information is required or through the return of the entire registration package.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Frequency of registration and fee. A person who is required to register must do so on an annual basis by submitting a completed Statement of Registration (form DS-2032) and a fee following the fee guidelines available on the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Web site at www.pmddtc.state.gov. Registrants are not required to submit a separate statement of registration and pay an additional fee when provisions in Sec. 129.3(d) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Frequency of registration and fee. A person who is required to register must do so on an annual basis by submitting a completed Statement of Registration (form DS-2032) and a fee following the fee guidelines available on the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Web site at www.pmddtc.state.gov. Registrants are not required to submit a separate statement of registration and pay an additional fee when provisions in Sec. 129.3(d) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expiration of registration. A registrant must submit its request for registration renewal at least 30 days, but no earlier than 60 days, prior to the expiration date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lapse in registration. A registrant who fails to renew a registration and, after an intervening period, seeks to register again must pay registration

fees for any part of such intervening period during which the registrant engaged in the business of brokering defense articles or defense services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement of Registration Certification. The Statement of Registration (form DS-2032) of the intended registrant shall include a certification by an authorized senior officer of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the intended registrant or its parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed in the Statement of Registration, or any of its chief executive officers, presidents, vice presidents, secretaries, partners, members, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel), or any member of the board of directors of the intended registrant, or of any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed in the Statement of Registration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has ever been indicted or otherwise charged (e.g., charged by criminal information in lieu of indictment) for or has been convicted of violating any U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in Sec. 120.27 of this subchapter or violating a foreign criminal law on exportation of defense articles where conviction of such law carries a minimum term of imprisonment of greater than 1 year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the intended registrant is foreign owned or foreign controlled (see Sec. 120.37 of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is foreign owned or foreign controlled, the certification shall include an explanation of such ownership or control, including the identities of the foreign person or persons who ultimately own or control the registrant. This requirement applies to a registrant who is a U.S. person and is owned or controlled by a foreign person. It also applies to a registrant who is a foreign person and is owned or controlled by a foreign person from the same country or a foreign person from another country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A registrant must, within five days of the event, provide to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls a written notification, signed by a senior officer (e.g., chief executive officer, president, secretary, partner, member, treasurer, general counsel), if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any of the persons referred to in Sec. 129.8(c) is indicted or otherwise charged (e.g., charged by criminal information in lieu of indictment) for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in Sec. 120.27 of this subchapter or violating a foreign criminal law on exportation of defense articles where conviction of such law carries a minimum term of imprisonment of greater than 1 year; or becomes ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to export or import defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S. government; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a change in the following information contained in the Statement of Registration (form DS-2032):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Registrant's name;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Registrant's address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Registrant's legal organization structure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ownership or control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The establishment, acquisition or divestment of a U.S. or foreign subsidiary or other affiliate who is engaged in brokering activities or otherwise required to be listed in registrant's Statement of Registration; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Board of directors, senior officers, partners and owners.</p><p class="depth4">Note 1 to paragraph (d): All other changes in the Statement of Registration must be provided as part of annual registration renewal.</p><p class="depth4">Note 2 to paragraph (d): For one year from October 25, 2013, ``Amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations: Registration and Licensing of Brokers, Brokering Activities, and Related Provisions,'' RIN 1400-AC37, the following changes must be provided as part of the annual registration renewal: pursuant to Sec. 129.3(d), changes to combine an existing broker registration with an existing manufacturer/exporter registration, and pursuant to Sec. 129.8(a), changes to an existing registration to remove partially owned and not otherwise controlled subsidiaries or affiliates, which are not the subject of an internal reorganization, merger, acquisition, or divestiture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A U.S. or foreign registrant must provide written notification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at least sixty (60) days in advance of any intended sale or transfer to a foreign

person of ownership or control of the registrant or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate listed and covered in its Statement of Registration. Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining any prior approval required under this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, another company or a subsidiary or division of another company, shall advise the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The new firm name and all previous firm names;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The registration number that will continue and those that are to be discontinued (if any); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The numbers of all approvals for brokering activities under the continuing registration number, since any approval not the subject of notification will be considered invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A registrant whose registration lapses because of failure to renew and, after an intervening period, seeks to register again must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period during which the registrant engaged in the business of brokering activities.
