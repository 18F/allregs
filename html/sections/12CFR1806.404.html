                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sufficient funds available to cover estimated awards. All BEA Program Awards are subject to the availability of funds. If the amount of appropriated funds available during a funding round is sufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, and an Applicant meets all of the program requirements specified in this part, then such Applicant shall receive an actual award amount that is

calculated by the CDFI Fund in the manner specified in Sec.  1806.403.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Insufficient funds available to cover estimated awards. If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, then the CDFI Fund will select Recipients and determine actual award amounts based on the process described in subsection 1806.404(c) and any established maximum dollar amount of awards that may be awarded for the Distressed Community Financing Activities category, as described in the applicable NOFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Priority of awards. In circumstances where there are insufficient funds to cover estimated awards, the CDFI Fund will rank Applicants based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, and in each category of Qualified Activity (e.g., Service Activities) according to the priorities described in this paragraph (c). Selections within each priority category will be based on the Applicants' relative rankings within each category, and based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, subject to the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First priority. If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient for all estimated award amounts, first priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second priority. If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first priority Applicants but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, second priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Distressed Community Financing Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third priority. If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first and second priority Applicants, but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, third priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Calculating actual award amounts. The CDFI Fund will determine actual award amounts based upon the availability of funds, increases in Qualified Activities from the Baseline to the Assessment Period, and an Applicant's priority ranking. If an Applicant receives an award for more than one priority category described in this section, the CDFI Fund will combine the award amounts into a single BEA Program Award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unobligated or deobligated funds. The CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may use any deobligated funds or funds not obligated during a funding round:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To select Applicants not previously selected, using the calculation and selection process contained in this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To make additional monies available for a subsequent funding round; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As otherwise authorized by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Limitation. The CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may deny or limit the amount of a BEA Program Award for any reason.</p>
