                            <p class="depth0">Use the following forms to transfer ownership:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SF 97, The United States Government Certificate to Obtain Title to a Motor Vehicle, if both of the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The motor vehicle will be retitled by a State, Commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purchaser intends to operate the motor vehicle on highways.</p><p class="depth3">Note to Sec. 102-34.305(a)(2):</p><p class="depth3">Do not use SF 97 if the Government-owned motor vehicle is either not designed or not legal for operation on highways. Examples are construction equipment, farm machinery, and certain military-design motor vehicles and motor vehicles that are damaged beyond repair in crashes and intended to be sold as salvage only. Instead, use an appropriate bill of sale or award document. Examples are Optional Form 16, Sales Slip--Sale of Government Personal Property, and SF 114C, Sale of Government Property-Bid and Award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SF 97 is optional for foreign fleet motor vehicles because foreign governments may require the use of other forms.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 102-34.305: The original SF 97 is printed on secure paper to identify readily any attempt to alter the form. The form is also pre-numbered to prevent duplicates. State motor vehicle agencies may reject certificates showing erasures or strikeovers.</p>
