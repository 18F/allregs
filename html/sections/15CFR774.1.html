                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope of the control list. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes ``items''--i.e., ``commodities,'' ``software,'' and ``technology''--subject to the authority of BIS. The CCL does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL may contain a reference to such controls. In addition, those items ``subject to the EAR'' but not identified on the CCL are identified by the designator ``EAR99.'' See Sec. 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are ``subject to the EAR.'' EAR Part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ECCN cross-references for items subject to exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. (1) Prior to October 15, 2013, the CCL contained certain ECCNs that were only included as cross references to items subject to the export control regulations administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ECCNs formerly listed on the CCL that, as of October 15, 2013 were subject to the export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 10 CFR part 110 are: 0A001, 0B001, 0B002, 0B003, 0B004, 0B005, 0B006, 0C001, 0C002, 0C004, 0C005, 0C006, 0C201 and 1C012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following multilateral export control regime reference is provided, as an additional point of historical reference: 0C201--INFCIRC 254 Part 1, 5.3.1(b).</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b): ECCNs 0D001 and 0E001 are ``subject to the ITAR'' (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130). These ECCNs are retained on the CCL as cross references to the ITAR, although the former cross references to export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (see 10 CFR part 110) for ECCN 0D001, and to the Department of Energy (see 10 CFR part 810) for 0E001 were removed from the Control(s) paragraph in the License Requirements section of these two ECCNs and added as a more general jurisdictional cross reference in a heading note added to these two ECCNs as of June 5, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where to find the CCL? The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part, and Supplement No. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Conventions related to the use of quotation marks on the CCL. The use of double quotation marks on the CCL is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the CCL that are defined in part 772 (Definitions of Terms), or for purposes of ECCNs, where a definition is provided in the ``related definitions'' paragraph in the License Requirements section of ECCNs or sometimes in Notes and Technical Notes for particular ECCNs and that definition is specific to that particular ECCN. In this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the CCL that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. It is also a useful compliance practice to review the ``Related Definitions'' paragraph and Notes and Technical Notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular ECCN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of double quotes. If a term on the CCL uses double quotes it means there is a defined term in part 772. However, the absence of double quotes does not mean that a term used on the CCL is not defined in part 772. Because the CCL includes many terms that are defined in part 772, BIS's practice is to use double quotes for certain key terms and to use double quotes when needed for consistency with multilateral export control regime based entries, such as many derived from control lists, in particular for the Wassenaar Arrangement that also uses the double quotes convention. However, because of the large number of defined terms used on the CCL and a desire to avoid hindering readability by placing quotes around too many words used in particular ECCNs, BIS's practice is to not add double quotes around certain terms, such as items and commodities. This convention also applies to the use of double quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of single quotes. The CCL also includes a convention regarding the use of single quotes. Single quotes on the CCL identify a term as a defined term in the context of a particular ECCN. This convention also applies to the use of single quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.

The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.2. For the purpose of 1A007.b the detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, ``composite'', dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or ``laser'' irradiation.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2: 1Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.</p><p class="depth0">Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.</p><p class="depth0">b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;</p><p class="depth0">2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a

controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;</p><p class="depth0">3. ``Laser'' Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave ``laser'' beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;</p><p class="depth0">4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.</p><p class="depth0">c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:</p><p class="depth0">1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);</p><p class="depth0">2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and</p><p class="depth0">3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757 [deg]C) to 1,375 K (1,102 [deg]C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.</p><p class="depth0">d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 [deg]C) at 0.1 MPa.</p><p class="depth0">e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.</p><p class="depth0">f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.</p><p class="depth0">g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or sputter deposition.Accompanying Technical Information to Table on Deposition Techniques:</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Technology'' for pretreatments of the substrates listed in the Table, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a.

Sec. Supplement No. 4 to Part 774--Commerce Control List Order of Review</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As described in EAR Sec. 734.3, the EAR govern only items ``subject to the EAR,'' e.g., items not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. Thus, for example, if an item is described in the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR Part 121) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130), including one

of its catch-all paragraphs, then the item is a ``defense article'' subject to the ITAR and there is no need to review the CCL with respect to whether it describes the item. See 22 CFR Sec. 120.6 (``Defense article means any item or technical data designated in Sec. 121.1 of the ITAR. The policy described in Sec. 120.3 is applicable to designations of additional items''). If an item is not described on the USML and is otherwise ``subject to the EAR,'' then work through each of the following steps to determine where the item is covered by the CCL or, if it is not covered by the CCL, and is therefore designated as EAR99.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step 1. To classify an item ``subject to the EAR'' against the CCL, review the general characteristics of the item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category (0 through 9) on the CCL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2. Once the potentially applicable CCL categories are identified, determine which product group within the CCL category or categories--i.e., A, B, C, D, or E--is applicable to the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 3. The ``600 series'' describes military items that were once subject to the ITAR. The 9x515 ECCNs describe ``spacecraft,'' related items, and some radiation-hardened microelectronic circuits that were once subject to the ITAR under USML Category XV. Just as the ITAR effectively trumps the EAR, items described in a 9x515 ECCN or ``600 series'' ECCN trump other ECCNs on the CCL. Thus, the next step in conducting a classification analysis of an item ``subject to the EAR'' is to determine whether it is described in a 9x515 ECCN or ``600 series'' ECCN paragraph other than a ``catch-all'' paragraph such as a ``.x'' paragraph that controls unspecified ``parts'' and ``components'' ``specially designed'' for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. If so, the item is classified under that 9x515 ECCN or ``600 series'' ECCN paragraph even if it would also be described in another ECCN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 4. If the item is not described in a 9x515 ECCN or ``600 series'' ECCN, then determine whether the item is classified under a 9x515 ECCN or ``600 series'' catch-all paragraph, i.e., one that controls non-specific ``parts,'' ``components,'' ``accessories,'' and ``attachments'' ``specially designed'' for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. Such items are generally in the ``.x'' paragraph of ECCN 9A515 or a ``600 series'' ECCN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Step 4.a. Determine whether the item would meet the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the ``specially designed'' definition in Sec. 772.1 of the EAR. (These are informally known as the ``catch'' paragraphs.) If not applicable, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a ``specially designed'' control parameter. Skip to Step 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 4.b. If the item meets the criteria of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the ``specially designed'' definition, then determine whether any of the provisions of paragraph (b) of the ``specially designed'' definition would apply. (These are informally known as the ``release'' provisions.) If so, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a ``specially designed'' control parameter.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a)(4): The emphasis on the word ``control'' in Steps 4.a and 4.b is deliberate. Some ECCNs use ``specially designed'' as a de-control parameter. If an item would not be classified under a particular ECCN because it falls within the scope of either subparagraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the ``specially designed'' definition, then there is no need to analyze whether any element of paragraph (b) of the definition would apply to the item. One needs only review the ``release'' provisions in paragraph (b) of the ``specially designed'' definition if paragraph (a) of the ``specially designed'' definition applies to the item in a ``control'' paragraph of an ECCN that uses the term ``specially designed.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Step 5. If an item is not classified by a ``600 series'' or in a 9x515 ECCN, then starting from the beginning of the product group analyze each ECCN to determine whether any other ECCN in that product group describes the item. If any ECCN uses the term ``specially designed,'' see Steps 4.a and 4.b above in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) respectively. If the item is described in one of these ECCNs, then the item is classified under that ECCN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Step 6. If the item is not described under any ECCN of any category of the CCL, then the item is designated as EAR99. EAR99 items may require a license if destined for a prohibited or restricted end user, end use or destination. See paragraphs (g) through (n) of Sec. 732.3 ``Steps Regarding the Ten General Prohibitions,'' or General Prohibitions Four through Ten of part 736 of the EAR for license requirements other than those imposed by the CCL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
