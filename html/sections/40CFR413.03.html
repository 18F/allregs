I further certify that this facility is implementing the toxic organic management plan submitted to the control authority.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In requesting that no monitoring be required industrial users of POTWs shall submit a toxic organic management plan that specifies to the control authority's satisfaction the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If monitoring is necessary to measure compliance with the TTO standard the industrial user need analyze only for those pollutants which would reasonably be expected to be present.
