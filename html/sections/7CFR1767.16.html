                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Classification of electric plant at effective date of system of  accounts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same  as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion  of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in  classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these  changes, the   balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior  system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of  plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of  the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following  instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be  ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not  be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged  to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the  USoA in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of  management as exercised under a USoA, or under accounting practices  previously followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive)  shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed  by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired  as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original  cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after  giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or  amortization shall be recorded in Account 114, Electric Plant  Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be  determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the  predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant  previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference  between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for  depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary  adjustments for retirements from date of acquisition, shall be entered  in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference  between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly  includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in Account 116, Other  Electric Plant Adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease  property under Sec. 1767.15(s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, shall  be recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account  120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Electric plant to be recorded at cost. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All amounts included  in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or  system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible  plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who  first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant  shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility  except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease  property under Sec. 1767.15 (s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, and is  recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Lease, or Account  120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases. Where the term ``cost'' is  used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in  this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the consideration given for property is other than cash,  the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis  (see, however, the definition of cost in Sec. 1767.10). In the entry  recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described  with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be  prepared to furnish RUS the particulars of its determination of the cash  value of the consideration if other than cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred  payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for  interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such  form of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other  value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the  form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric  plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such  construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its  equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when  assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of  accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work  order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along  with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a  credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Components of construction cost. The cost of construction  properly includible in the electric plant accounts shall include, where  applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined  hereunder:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contract work includes amounts paid for work performed under  contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to  the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Labor includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility  engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation  insurance, payroll taxes, and similar items of expense. It does not  include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to  construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included  in other items hereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Materials and supplies includes the purchase price at the point  of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of  inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and  the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining  the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper  allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials  recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work  involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of  materials and supplies.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for  example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools  and implements, shall not be charged to utility plant accounts unless  the correctness of the accounting therefor is verified by current  inventories. The cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating  expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of such items, or, if  such items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost shall be  included as part of the cost of the construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transportation includes the cost of transporting employees,  materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work  equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction.  It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the  utility's own transportation equipment.

It does not include the  cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short  life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See Item  in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.) When a particular construction job  requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines,  transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the  appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be  include in the cost of construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Shop service includes the proportion of the expense of the  utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that  the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be  included in ``materials and supplies.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Protection includes the cost of protecting the utility's  property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing  damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for  discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and  prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid  to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous  items of expenditures in connection with construction work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Injuries and damages includes expenditures or losses in  connection with construction work on account of injuries to persons and  damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of and  defense against actions for such injuries and damages. Insurance  recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to  persons incident to construction shall be credited to the account or  accounts to which such compensation is   charged. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property  damages incident to construction shall be credited to the account or  accounts charged with the cost of the damages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Privileges and permits includes payments for and expenses  incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in  connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or  public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents, or  amounts chargeable as franchises and consents for which see Account 302,  Franchises and Consents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Rents includes amounts paid for the use of construction  quarters and office space occupied by construction forces and amounts  properly includible in construction costs for such facilities jointly  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Engineers and supervision includes the portion of the pay and  expenses of engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, inspectors, superintendents  and their assistants applicable to construction work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> General administration capitalized includes the portion of the  pay and expenses of the general officers and administrative and general  expenses applicable to construction work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Engineering services includes amounts paid to other companies,  firms, or individuals engaged by the utility to plan, design, prepare  estimates, supervise, inspect, or give general advice and assistance in  connection with construction work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Insurance includes premiums paid or amounts provided or  reserved as self-insurance for the protection against loss and damages  in connection with construction, by fire or other casualty, injuries or  deaths of persons other than employees, damages to property of others,  defalcation of employees and agents, and the nonperformance of  contractual obligations of others. It does not include workmen's  compensation or similar insurance on employees included as ``labor'' in  Item in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Law expenditures includes the general law expenditures incurred  in connection with construction and the court and legal costs directly  related thereto, other than law expenses included in ``Protection,''  Item in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, and in Injuries and damages,  Item in paragraph (c)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Taxes includes taxes on physical property (including land)  during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in  construction costs before the facilities become available for service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)(i)</em>  of this section. No allowance for funds used during construction charges  shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction  projects which have been abandoned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance  for funds used during construction shall be: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16SE91.004  Where:  Ai = Gross allowance for borrowed funds used during</p><p class="depth0">construction rate. Ac = Allowance for other funds used during construction rate. S = Average short-term debt.   s = Short-term debt interest rate. D = Long-term debt. d = Long-term debt interest rate.

W = Average balance in construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel</p><p class="depth0">in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and</p><p class="depth0">fabrication, less asset retirement costs related to plant</p><p class="depth0">under construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rate shall be determined annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The balance for long-term debt, preferred stock, and patronage  capital assigned shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the  prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The cost rate for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be  the weighted average cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The cost rate for patronage capital assigned shall be the  entity's incremental borrowing rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average  balance for construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process  of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication shall be  estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual  data becomes available.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When only a portion of a plant or project is placed in  operation or is completed and ready for service but the construction  work as a whole is incomplete, that part of the cost of the property  placed in operation or ready for service shall be treated as ``Electric  Plant in Service,'' and an allowance for funds used during construction  thereon as a charge to construction shall cease. Allowance for funds  used during construction on that part of the cost of the plant which is  incomplete may continue to be charged to construction until such time as  it is placed in operation or is ready for service, except as limited in  Item in paragraph (c)(17) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Earnings and expenses during construction. The earnings and  expenses during construction shall constitute a component of  construction costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The earnings shall include revenues received or earned for power  produced by generating plants during the construction period and sold or  used by the utility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Where such power is sold to an independent purchaser before  intermingling with power generated by other plants, the credit shall  consist of the selling price of the energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the power generated by a plant under construction is  delivered to the utility's electric system for distribution and sale, or  is delivered to an associated company, or is delivered to and used by  the utility for purposes other than distribution and sale (for  manufacturing or industrial use, for example), the credit shall be the  fair value of the energy so delivered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Revenue shall also include rentals for lands, buildings, and  other property, and miscellaneous receipts not properly includible in  other accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses shall consist of the cost of operating the power  plant, and other costs incident to the production and delivery of the  power for which construction is credited under paragraph (c)(18)(i) of  this section, including the cost of repairs and other expenses of  operating and maintaining lands, buildings, and other property, and  other miscellaneous and like expenses not properly includible in other  accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Training costs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When it is necessary that employees be  trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being  constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are  new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a  component of construction cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training  costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See  Sec. 1767.17 (d).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Studies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Studies include the costs of studies such as  nuclear operational, safety, or seismic studies, or environmental  studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to plant under  construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Studies relative to facilities in service shall be charged to  Account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Asset retirement. The costs recognized as a result of asset  retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of  utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Overhead construction costs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All overhead construction  costs, such as   engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses,  construction engineering and supervision performed by others than the  accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages,  relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular  jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably  applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its  equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit,  both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts as  the time the property is retired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As far as practicable, the determination of payroll charges  includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card  distributions thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be  made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to  construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have  a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The addition to direct construction cost of arbitrary  percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The records supporting the entries for overhead constructions  costs shall be so kept as to show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total amount of each overhead for each year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to  each construction work order and to each electric plant account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The bases of distribution of such costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Electric plant purchased or sold. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When electric plant  constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase,  merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective  date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including  expenses incidental thereto properly includible in electric plant, shall  be charged to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be  credited to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and  concurrently charged to the appropriate electric plant in service  accounts and to Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account  105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use; and Account 107, Construction  Work in Progress--Electric, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The depreciation and amortization applicable to the original  cost of the properties purchased shall be charged to Account 102,  Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the  appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation or  amortization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost to the utility of any property includible in Account  121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount remaining in Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased  or Sold, shall then be closed to Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition  Adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or  system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary  to substantially rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to  the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except  replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of  the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When any property acquired as an operating unit or system  includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the  accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its  consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting  for such property shall be presented to RUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In connection with the acquisition of electric plant  constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if  possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired or  certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity  with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of  its own construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is  sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger,  consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold   or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility  plant accounts, including amounts carried in Account 114, Electric Plant  Acquisition Adjustments, and the amounts (estimated if not known)  carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision  for depreciation and amortization and in Account 252, Customer Advances  for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and contra entries  made to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise  ordered by RUS, the difference, if any, between:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The net amount of debits and credits, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The consideration received for the property (less commissions  and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in Account  421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or Account 421.2, Loss on  Disposition of Property. (See Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or  Sold.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: In cases where existing utilities merge or consolidate because  of financial or operating reasons or statutory requirements rather than  as a means of transferring title of purchased properties to a new owner,  the accounts of the constituent utilities, with the approval of RUS, may  be combined. In the event original cost has not been determined, the  resulting utility shall proceed to determine such cost as outlined  herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Expenditures on leased property. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cost of substantial  initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and  betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service  property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of  subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such  property, shall be charged to the electric plant account appropriate for  the class of property leased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action  of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be  spread over the life of the lease by charges to Account 404,  Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the service life is not terminated by action of the lease  but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net  salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of  (1) are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or  operating leases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If improvements made to property leased for a period of more  than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a  period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be  charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or  by amortization thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Land and land rights. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The accounts for land and land rights  shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights,  interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others,  such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion  rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in  land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and  rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and  grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with  the construction and installation of plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts  directly benefited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where special assessments for public improvements provide for  deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged  to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried  in an appropriate liability account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate  interest account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in  the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the  appropriate tax account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel,  other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or  other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant accounts to which  related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber  and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increase  in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the   natural resources) from the sale of timber or its products or other  natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating  income account when such land has been recorded in Account 105, Electric  Plant Held for Future Use, or classified as plant in service, otherwise  to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or  retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights- of-way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more  than one year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership,  full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used,  city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or  to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and  number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall  refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land  or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the  sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, shall be included in  Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses  from Disposition of Utility Plant, when such property has been recorded  in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to Account  421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of  Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized  and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with  respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public  improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If, at the  time of acquisition of an interest in land, such interest extends to  buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which  are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall  be separately appraised and a cost allocated to land and buildings or  improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are  removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of  removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the  account in which the cost of land is recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the  purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the  specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land  purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which  is not to be used in utility operations.

class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or  without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the  electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner  set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If the retirement  unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and  credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision  for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and  the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such  depreciation account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be  accounted for as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, if a substantial addition results,  otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the  book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in  which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of  depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for  depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and  credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item  retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its  inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is  retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when  such minor item is retired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced  independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of  replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for  the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial  betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected  more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater  capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at  current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the  appropriate electric plant accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at  which such property is included in the electric plant accounts,  including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be  determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done, it  shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost  of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof,  an appropriate average book cost of the units with due allowance for any  differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the  units retired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the  appropriate land accounts. If the land is sold, the difference between  the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or  amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the  sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making  the sale) shall be recorded in Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of  Utility Plant, or Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility  Plant, when the   property has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for  Future Use, otherwise to Accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of  Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If  the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility,  the book cost shall be charged to Account 105, Electric Plant Held for  Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant  retired shall be charged in its entirety to Account 108, Accumulated  Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant in Service. Any  amounts which, by approval or order of RUS, are charged to Account  182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to Account 108.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in Account  302, Franchises and Consents, and Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible  Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the  accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text  of Account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric  Utility Plant in Service; Account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term  Electric Plant; and Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Work order and property record system required. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each utility  shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means  of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for  additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be  included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all  items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those  relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance  costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the  nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total  cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant  account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering  jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant  account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are  classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units  or retirement units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Transfers of property. When property is transferred from one  electric plant account to another, from one utility department to  another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or  area to another, to or from Account 101, Electric Plant in Service;  Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account 105, Electric  Plant Held for Future Use, and Account 121, Nonutility Property, the  transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof  from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related  amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for  depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the  segregation of such accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Common utility plant. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the utility is engaged in more than  one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its  utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for  other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is  impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the  accounts, such property, with the approval of RUS, may be designated and  classified as ``common utility plant.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant  shall be included in Account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable  in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted  for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in Accounts 101 to  107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in Account 116, Other  Electric Plant Adjustments; any amounts classifiable as common plant  acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to  disposition as provided in Paragraphs C and B of Accounts 114 and 116,  respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original  cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to  the detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The utility shall be prepared to show, at any time, and to  report to RUS annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility  plant accounts (301 to 399) the book cost of common utility plant, the  allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common  utility plant, and the basis of the allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of  the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to  the property classified as common utility plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and  amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts  prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation  of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall  be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of  allocation used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Transmission and distribution plant. For the purpose of this  system of accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transmission system is all land, conversion structures, and  equipment employed at a primary source of supply (i.e. generating  station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) to change  the voltage or frequency of electricity for the purpose of its more  efficient or convenient transmission; all land, structures, lines,  switching and conversion stations, high tension apparatus, and their  control and protective equipment between a generating or receiving point  and the entrance to a distribution center or wholesale point; and all  lines and equipment whose primary purpose is to augment, integrate or  tie together the sources of power supply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distribution system is all land, structures, conversion  equipment, lines, line transformers, and other facilities employed  between the primary source of supply (i.e. generating station, or point  of receipt in the case of purchased power) and of delivery to customers,  which are not includible in transmission system, as defined in Item in  paragraph (n)(1) of this section, whether or not such land, structures,  and facilities are operated as part of a transmission system or as part  of a distribution system.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Stations which change electricity from transmission to  distribution voltage shall be classified as distribution stations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where poles or towers support both transmission and distribution  conductors, the poles, towers, anchors, guys, and rights-of-way shall be  classified as transmission system. The conductors, cross-arms, braces,  grounds, tiewire, and insulators shall be classified as transmission or  distribution facilities, according to the purpose for which used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where underground conduit contains both transmission and  distribution conductors, the underground conduit and right-of-way shall  be classified as distribution system.
