                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. The book income  adjustment is 50 percent of the excess, if any, of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted net book income (as defined in paragraph (b) of  this section) of the taxpayer, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income for the  taxable year.   For purposes of this section, pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income is alternative minimum taxable income, determined without regard  to the book income adjustment or the alternative tax net operating loss  determined under section 56(a)(4). See paragraph (a)(4) of this section  for examples relating to the computation of the income adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxpayers subject to the book income adjustment. The book income  adjustment is applicable to any corporate taxpayer that is not an S  corporation, regulated investment company (RIC), real estate investment  trust (REIT), or real estate mortgage investment company (REMIC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this section). See paragraph (a)(4), Example 4  of this section. For purposes of this section, with respect to any  taxable year the term ``consolidated group'' has the same meaning as in  Sec.  1.1502-1T. See paragraph (d)(6) of this section for rules relating  to adjustments attributable to related corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A has adjusted net book income of $200 and  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income of $100. A must  increase its pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income by $50  (($200-$100) x .50).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation B has adjusted net book income of $200 and  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income of $300. B does not  have a book income adjustment for the taxable year because its adjusted  net book income does not exceed its pre-adjustment alternative minimum  taxable income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation C has adjusted net book income of negative  $200 and pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income of negative  $300. C must increase its pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income by $50 ((-$200 - (-$300)) x .50). Thus, C's alternative minimum  taxable income determined after the book income adjustment, but without  regard to the alternative tax net operating loss, is negative $250 (- $300 + $50).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Corporations D and E are a consolidated group for tax  purposes. D and E do not have a consolidated financial statement. On  their separate financial statements D and E have adjusted net book  income of $100 and $50 respectively, and pre-adjustment alternative  minimum taxable income of $50 and $80 respectively. Assuming there are  no intercompany transactions, DE's consolidated adjusted net book income  (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) is $150 and its  consolidated pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income (as  defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) is $130.   DE must increase its consolidated pre-adjustment alternative minimum  taxable income by $10 (($150-$130)x.50).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted net book income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. ``Adjusted net book  income'' means the net book income (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section) adjusted as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer may not  make any adjustments to net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net book income--(i) In general. ``Net book income'' means the  income or loss for a taxpayer reported in the taxpayer's applicable  financial statement (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section). Net  book income must take into account all items of income, expense, gain  and loss of the taxable year, including extraordinary items, income or  loss from discontinued operations, and cumulative adjustments resulting  from accounting method changes. Net book income is not reduced by any  distributions to shareholders. See paragraph (b)(5)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section  for a similar rule for corporations using current earnings and profits  to compute net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Measures of net book income. Except as described in paragraph  (b)(5) of this section, net book income is disclosed on the income  statement included in a taxpayer's applicable financial statement. Such  income statement must reconcile with the balance sheet, if any, that is  included in the applicable financial statement and must be used in  computing changes in owner's equity reflected in the applicable  financial statement. See paragraph (c) of this section for the  definition of an applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax-free transactions and tax-free income. Net book income  includes income or loss that is reported on a taxpayer's applicable  financial statement regardless of whether such income or loss is  recognized, realized or otherwise taken into account for other Federal  income tax purposes. See paragraph (b)(7), Examples 1, 2 and 3 of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of dividends and other amounts. The adjusted net book  income of a taxpayer shall include the earnings of other corporations  not filing a consolidated Federal income tax return with the taxpayer  only to the extent that amounts are required to be included in the  taxpayer's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code with respect to the  earnings of such other corporation (e.g., dividends received from such  corporation and amounts included under subpart A). See paragraph (b)(7),  Examples 4 and 5 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional rules for consolidated groups--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consolidated  adjusted net book income. ``Consolidated adjusted net book income''  means the consolidated net book income (as defined in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section), after taking into account the adjustments  under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consolidated net book income. Consolidated net book income is  the income or loss of a consolidated group as reported on its applicable  financial statement as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consolidated pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income. Consolidated pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income  is the taxable income of the consolidated group for the taxable year,  determined with the adjustments provided in sections 56 and 58 (except  for the book income adjustment and the alternative tax net operating  loss determined under section 56(a)(4)) and increased by the preference  items described in section 57.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cross references. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for  rules relating to the applicable financial statement of related  corporations and paragraph (d)(6) of this section for rules relating to  adjustments attributable to related corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Computation of adjusted net book income when taxable year and  financial accounting year differ--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a taxpayer's  applicable financial statement is prepared on the basis of a financial  accounting year that differs from the year that the taxpayer uses for  filing its Federal income tax return, adjusted net book income must be  computed either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By including a pro rata portion of the adjusted net book income  for each financial accounting year that includes any part of the  taxpayer's taxable year (see paragraph (b)(7), Example 6 of this  section), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In accordance with the election described in paragraph  (b)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Estimating adjusted net book income. If a taxpayer is using the  pro rata approach described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section  and an applicable financial statement for part of the taxpayer's taxable  year is not available when the taxpayer files its Federal income tax  return, the taxpayer must make a reasonable estimate of adjusted net  book income for the pro rata portion of the taxable year. If the actual  pro rata portion of adjusted net book income that results from the  taxpayer's applicable financial statement for the financial accounting  year exceeds the estimate of adjusted net book income used on the  original tax return and results in additional tax liability, the  taxpayer must file an amended Federal income tax return reflecting such  additional liability. The amended return must be filed within 90 days of  the date the previously unavailable applicable financial statement is  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, if a  taxpayer uses a 52-53 week year for financial accounting or Federal  income tax purposes, the last day of such year shall be deemed to occur  on the last day of the calendar month ending closest to the end of such  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Time of making election. An election under this paragraph  (b)(4)(iii) is made by attaching the statement described in paragraph  (b)(4)(iii)(C) of this section to the taxpayer's Federal income tax  return for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer is eligible to  make the election. An election under this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) that is  made prior to the first taxable year in which the taxpayer is eligible  to make the election (as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C) of  this section) is valid unless revoked pursuant to paragraph  (b)(4)(iii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Eligibility to make and manner of making election. A taxpayer is  eligible to make the election specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of  this section in the first taxable year beginning after 1986 in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxpayer has an accounting year ending five or more months  after the end of its taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The use of the pro rata approach described in paragraph  (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section produces an excess of adjusted net book  income over pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income, as  defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer has an excess of tentative minimum tax over regular  tax for the taxable year, as defined in section 55(a), or is liable for  the environmental tax imposed by section 59A.  Thus, a taxpayer is not required to evaluate the merits of an election  to compute its adjusted net book income based on the applicable  financial statement prepared for the financial accounting year ending  within the taxpayer's taxable year unless the taxpayer, when using the  pro rata approach described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section,  either has an excess of tentative minimum tax over its regular tax or is  liable for the environmental tax imposed by section 59A. The election  statement must set forth the electing taxpayer's name, address, taxpayer  identification number, taxable year and financial accounting year. An  election under this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) will apply for the taxable  year when initially made and for all subsequent years until revoked with  the consent of the District Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Election or revocation of election made on an amended return. An  election under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section may be made by  attaching the statement described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C) to an  amended return for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer is  eligible to make the election. An election under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)  of this section that was made prior to   the first taxable year in which the taxpayer was eligible to make the  election, as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C) of this section,  may be revoked by filing an amended return for the taxable year in which  the election was initially made. However, an election made or revoked on  an amended return under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section will be  allowed only if the amended return is filed no later than December 14,  1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(B)(1)</em> of this section for priority  rules relating to statements required to be filed with the SEC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Computation of net book income using current earnings and  profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a taxpayer does not have an applicable  financial statement, or only has a statement described in paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section and makes the election described in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, net book income for purposes of this section is  equal to the taxpayer's current earnings and profits for its taxable  year. Generally, a taxpayer's current earnings and profits is computed  under the rules of section 312 and the regulations thereunder. Current  earnings and profits therefore is reduced by Federal income tax expense  and any foreign tax expense for foreign taxes eligible for the foreign  tax credit under section 27 of the Code. Current earnings and profits is  then adjusted as described in paragraph (d) of this section to arrive at  adjusted net book income. No adjustment is made under paragraph (d) of  this section, however, for any adjustment that is already reflected in  current earnings and profits. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for  adjustments to net book income with respect to certain taxes. For  purposes of this section, current earnings and profits is not reduced by  any distribution to shareholders. See paragraph (d)(3)(iv), Example 5 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Current earnings and profits of a consolidated group. For  purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), the current earnings and profits of a  consolidated group is the aggregate of the current earnings and profits  of each member of the group, as determined pursuant to paragraph  (d)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Additional rules for computation of net book income of a foreign  corporate taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adjusted net book income of a foreign taxpayer.  Adjusted net book income of a foreign corporate taxpayer (``foreign  taxpayer'') means the effectively connected net book income (as defined  in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section) of the foreign taxpayer, after  taking into account the adjustments under the rules of paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effectively connected net book income of a foreign taxpayer-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Effectively connected net book income of a foreign  taxpayer is the income or loss reported in its applicable financial  statement (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section), but only  to the extent that such amount is attributable to items of income or  loss that would be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of  a trade or business in the United States by the foreign taxpayer as  determined under either the principles of section 864(c) and the  regulations thereunder, or any other applicable provision of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Thus, if for tax purposes an item of  income or loss is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a  trade or business in the United States, then the income or loss reported  on the foreign taxpayer's applicable financial statement attributable to  such item is effectively connected net book income. See paragraph  (b)(7), Examples 11, 12 and 13 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain exempt amounts. Effectively connected net book income  does not include any amount attributable to an item that is exempt from  United States taxation under sections 883, 892, 894 or 895 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986. See paragraph (b)(7), Examples 14 and 15  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of net book income of a foreign taxpayer using  current earnings   and profits. If a foreign taxpayer does not have an applicable financial  statement or only has a statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of  this section and makes the election described in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section, net book income for purposes of this section is equal to  the foreign taxpayer's current earnings and profits that are  attributable to income or loss that is effectively connected (or treated  as effectively connected) with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States. Effectively connected current earnings and profits are  computed under the rules of section 884(d) and the regulations  thereunder, relating to effectively connected earnings and profits for  purposes of computing the branch profits tax, but without regard to the  exceptions set forth under section 884(d)(2)(B) through (E). For  purposes of this section, effectively connected current earnings and  profits are not reduced by any remittances or distributions. Effectively  connected current earnings and profits takes into account Federal income  tax expense and any foreign tax expense; however, see paragraph (d)(3)  of this section for adjustments to net book income with respect to  certain taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A owns 100 percent of corporation B and the  AB affiliated group files a consolidated Federal income tax return. AB  uses a calendar year for both financial accounting and tax purposes.  During 1987, A transfers all of its stock in B for stock on an acquiring  corporation in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). Although  AB recognizes no taxable gain on the transfer pursuant to section 354,  gain from the transfer is reported on AB's 1987 applicable financial  statement. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, AB's net  book income includes the book gain attributable to the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation C uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. C adopted a plan of liquidation prior to  August 1, 1986. On June 1, 1987, C makes a bulk sale of all of its  assets subject to liabilities and completely liquidates. Pursuant to  section 633(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the Act), section 337, as  in effect prior to its amendment by the Act, applies. Thus, C will  generally not recognize taxable gain upon the bulk sale. However, C's  applicable financial statement for the period January 1, 1987 through  June 1, 1987, reports net book income of $500, $400 of which is  attributable to the bulk sale of assets on June 1, 1987. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, C's net book income includes the  amount attributable to the bulk sale. Thus, assuming C has no other  adjustments to net book income, its adjusted net book income for the  period January 1, 1987 through June 1, 1987, is $500.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation Z has a large inventory of marketable  securities. On its applicable financial statement, Z marks these  securities to market, i.e., as they appreciate in value, Z restates  their value on its balance sheet to their fair market value, and  increases the income on its income statement by that amount. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the adjusted net book income of Z  includes the income from the valuation adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Corporation D owns 100 percent of E, a controlled foreign  corporation as defined in section 957. Both D and E use a calendar year  for financial accounting and tax purposes. D's applicable financial  statement includes E. Pursuant to section 951, D includes $100 of E's  subpart F income in its gross income for 1987. Although D's applicable  financial statement is adjusted to eliminate E's income, pursuant to  paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, D's adjusted net book income for  1987 includes the $100 of gross income included under section 951.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Corporation F owns 20 percent of G, a foreign  corporation. Both F and G use a calendar year for financial accounting  and tax purposes. During 1987, G pays F a $100 dividend. F's applicable  financial statement accounts for F's investment in G by the equity  method. F is eligible for a deemed paid foreign tax credit of $30 with  respect to the dividend from G and must include the $130 in gross income  pursuant to section 78 of the Code. Although F's applicable financial  statement is adjusted to eliminate F's income from G under the equity  method, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, F's adjusted  net book income for 1987 includes the $130 of gross income recognized  with respect to the dividend from G.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Corporation H files its Federal income tax return on a  calendar year basis. However, its applicable financial statement is  based on a fiscal year ending June 30. H does not make the election  described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, H's adjusted net book income for  calendar year 1987 is computed by adding 50 percent of adjusted net book  income from the applicable financial statement for the year ending June  30, 1987 and 50 percent of adjusted net book income from the applicable  financial statement for the year ending June 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Corporation J files its Federal income tax returns for  1987, 1988, and 1989 on   a calendar year basis. However, its applicable financial statement is  based on a year ending May 31. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this  section, J elects in 1987 to compute its adjusted net book income by  using the applicable financial statement for the fiscal year ending May  31, 1987. Unless the District Director consents to revocation of the  election, for calendar year 1988 or 1989, J's adjusted net book income  for 1988 and 1989 is determined from its applicable financial statements  for the years ending May 31, 1988 and May 31, 1989, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as in Example 7, except that J's  applicable financial statement is based on a year ending April 30. Since  April 30, is less than 5 months after December 31, the end of J's  taxable year, J is not permitted to make the election described in  paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The facts are the same as in Example 8, except H files  quarterly and annual financial statements with the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC). The fourth quarter statement is included as a  footnote to the annual statement that it files with the SEC. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, H may not determine its net book  income by aggregating its four quarterly statements for 1987. Thus, H's  net book income is computed as described in Example 8.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Corporation I is a United States corporation with a 100  percent owned subsidiary, J, a foreign sales corporation (FSC). I uses a  calendar year for both financial accounting and tax purposes. Income  from J is consolidated in I's applicable financial statement. I and J do  not file a consolidated tax return. In 1987, J pays a dividend to I of  $100 out of J's earnings and profits. For purposes of this example, it  is assumed that the distribution is made out of the profits attributable  solely to foreign trade income determined through use of the  administrative pricing rules of section 925(a) (1) and (2). Accordingly,  the distribution is eligible for the 100 percent dividends received  deduction under section 245(c). Although I's applicable financial  statement is adjusted to eliminate income or loss attributable to J, the  entire amount of the dividend distribution must be included in I's  adjusted net book income pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Corporation K is a foreign corporation incorporated  under the laws of country X. K uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. In 1987, K actively conducts a real estate  business, L, in the United States. The financial statement that is used  as K's applicable financial statement (as determined under paragraph  (c)(5)(ii) of this section) discloses total net income of $150. Of this  amount, $100 is attributable to L's real estate business and $50 is  attributable to dividends paid to L from its investment in certain  securities. The securities investment is not connected with L's real  estate business. Under the rules of section 864, only $100 is  effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States. Thus, K's effectively connected net book income for 1987  equals $100.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Assume the same facts as in Example 11 except that K's  applicable financial statement also discloses $75 attributable to  investment real property located in the United States, so that the net  income amount reported on the financial statement equals $225. The $75  of income is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States. K, for regular tax purposes, makes an  election under section 882(d) to treat this income as effectively  connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  As a result, K's effectively connected net book income for 1987 equals  $175 ($100+$75).</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Corporation M is a foreign corporation that actively  conducts a manufacturing business, N, in the United States. M is a  calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax purposes.  In 1987, the financial statement that is used as M's applicable  financial statement (as determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this  section) reflects an anticipated loss from the sale of a division of N.  For Federal income tax purposes the loss is not recognized in 1987, but  rather is recognized in 1988 when M sells the division. In determining  M's effectively connected net book income for 1987, the anticipated loss  reported on M's 1987 applicable financial statement is taken into  account because the reported loss is effectively connected to the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States under the principles  of section 864.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. Corporation O is a foreign corporation that is engaged  in the international shipping business. O is incorporated under the laws  of X. O is a calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and  tax purposes. In 1987, O actively conducts a shipping business, P,  within the United States. The statement that is used in 1987 as O's  applicable financial statement (as determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)  of this section) discloses income of $100 that is attributable to P's  operation of ships in international traffic. Under section 864, $50 is  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States. However, the United States income tax treaty with X  exempts from United States income tax any income derived by a resident  of X from the operation of ships in international traffic. Thus,  pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, no amount of P's  income is includible in O's effectively connected net book income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Assume the same facts as in Example 14 except that there  is no United   States income tax treaty with X. However, X by statute exempts United  States citizens and United States corporations from tax imposed by X on  gross income derived from the operation of a ship or ships in  international traffic. Under section 883(a), P's income of $50 that is  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States is exempt from United States taxation. Thus, pursuant to  paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, no amount of P's income is  includible in O's effectively connected net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> that has the highest priority, as determined under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Generally, an applicable financial  statement includes an income statement, a balance sheet (listing assets,  liabilities, and owner's equity including changes thereto), and other  appropriate information. An income statement alone may constitute an  applicable financial statement for purposes of this section if the other  materials described in this paragraph are not prepared or used by the  taxpayer. However, an income statement that does not reconcile with  financial materials otherwise issued will not qualify as an applicable  financial statement. For purposes of determining the book income  adjustment, the following may be considered applicable financial  statements (subject to the rules relating to priority among statements  under paragraph (c)(3) of this section)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statement required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC). A financial statement that is required to be filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certified audited financial statement. A certified audited  financial statement that is used for credit purposes, for reporting to  shareholders or for any other substantial non-tax purpose. Such a  statement must be accompanied by the report of an independent (as  defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  Professional Standards, Code of Professional Conduct, Rule 101 and its  interpretations and rulings) Certified Public Accountant or, in the case  of a foreign corporation, a similarly qualified and independent  professional who is licensed in any foreign country. A financial  statement is ``certified audited'' for purposes of this section if it  is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Certified to be fairly presented (an unqualified or ``clean''  opinion),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subject to a qualified opinion that such financial statement is  fairly presented subject to a concern about a contingency (a qualified  ``subject to'' opinion),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Subject to a qualified opinion that such financial statement is  fairly presented, except for a method of accounting with which the  accountant disagrees (a qualified ``except for'' opinion), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Subject to an adverse opinion, but only if the accountant  discloses the amount of the disagreement with the statement.   Any other statement or report, such as a review statement or a  compilation report that is not subject to a full audit is not a  certified audited statement. See paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this  section for a special rule for a statement accompanied by a review  report when there are statements of equal priority. See also paragraph  (d)(5)(iii) of this section for rules relating to adjustments for  information disclosed in an accountant's opinion to a certified audited  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Financial statement provided to a government regulator. A  financial statement that is required to be provided to the Federal  government or any agency thereof (other than the Securities and Exchange  Commission), a state government or any agency thereof, or a political  subdivision of a state or any agency thereof. An income tax return,  franchise tax return or other tax return prepared for the purpose of  determining any tax liability that is filed with a Federal, state or  local government or agency cannot be an applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other financial statements. A financial statement that is used  for credit purposes, for reporting to shareholders, or for any other  substantial non-tax purpose, even though such financial statement is not  described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Required use of current earnings and profits. If a taxpayer does  not have a financial statement described in   paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the taxpayer  does not have an applicable financial statement. In that case, net book  income for the taxable year will be treated as being equal to the  taxpayer's current earnings and profits for the taxable year. See  paragraph (b)(5) of this section for rules relating to the computation  of current earnings and profits for the taxable year. See paragraph  (c)(4) of this section for rules relating to use of a financial  statement for a substantial non-tax purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election to treat net book income as equal to current earnings  and profits for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a taxpayer's only  financial statement is a statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of  this section, the taxpayer may elect to treat net book income as equal  to the taxpayer's current earnings and profits for all taxable years in  which the taxpayer is eligible to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time of making election. An election under this paragraph  (c)(2) is made by attaching the statement described in paragraph  (c)(2)(iii) of this section to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return  for the first taxable year the taxpayer is eligible to make the  election. An election under this paragraph (c)(2), which is made prior  to the first taxable year in which the taxpayer is eligible to make the  election, as determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, is  valid unless revoked pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligibility to make and manner of making election. A taxpayer  is eligible to make the election in the first taxable year in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer has an applicable financial statement described in  paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The use of this applicable financial statement produces an  excess of adjusted net book income over preadjustment alternative  minimum taxable income, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The taxpayer has, as determined under section 55(a), an excess  of tentative minimum tax over regular tax for the taxable year, or is  liable for the environmental tax imposed by section 59A.   Thus, a taxpayer is not required to evaluate the merits of an election  to use its current earnings and profits as its net book income unless  the taxpayer, when using an applicable financial statement described in  paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, has an excess of tentative minimum  tax over its regular tax or is liable for the environmental tax imposed  by section 59A. The election statement must set forth the electing  taxpayer's name, address and taxpayer identification number, state that  the election is being made under the provisions of section 56(f)(3)(B),  and state that the only financial statement of the taxpayer is a  financial statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.  An election under this paragraph (c)(2) is effective for every taxable  year in which the taxpayer does not have a financial statement described  in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section and may be  revoked only with the consent of the District Director. See paragraph  (c)(6), Example 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election or revocation of election made on an amended return.  An election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be made by  attaching the statement described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) to an amended  return for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer is eligible to  make the election. An election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section  that was made prior to the first taxable year in which the taxpayer was  eligible to make the election, as determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)  of this section, may be revoked by filing an amended return for the  taxable year in which the election was initially made. However, an  election made or revoked on an amended return will be allowed only if  the amended return is filed no later than December 14, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Election by common parent of consolidated group. The election by  the common parent of a consolidated group to treat net book income as  equal to current earnings and profits shall bind all members of the  group. This rule shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer that first,  has made the election on a return filed before August 16, 1990, second,  applied the election only to those members of the group that are   themselves eligible to make the election, and third, properly  consolidated the adjusted net book income of the group. In order to  change its election to apply to all members of the group, a taxpayer  must attach a statement to an amended return for the first taxable year  the taxpayer is eligible to make the election. However, an election made  on an amended return under this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) will be allowed  only if the amended return is filed no later than December 14, 1990. See  paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section regarding the current earnings and  profits of a consolidated group. See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this  section for adjustments that apply when a consolidated group uses  current earnings and profits to compute its net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priority among statements--(i) In general. If a taxpayer has  more than one financial statement described in paragraphs (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement is the statement with the highest priority. Priority is  determined in the following order--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A financial statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A certified audited statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A financial statement required to be provided to a Federal or  other government regulator described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any other financial statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)  of this section.   For example, corporation A, which uses a calendar year for both  financial accounting and tax purposes, prepares a financial statement  for calendar year 1987 that is provided to a state regulator and an  unaudited financial statement that is provided to A's creditors. The  statement provided to the state regulator is A's financial statement  with the highest priority and thus is A's applicable financial  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and (c)(1)(iv) of this  section, within each of these categories the taxpayer's applicable  financial statement is determined according to the following priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement used for credit purposes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement used for disclosure to shareholders, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other statement used for other substantial non-tax purposes.   For example, corporation B uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. B prepares a financial statement for  calendar year 1987 that it uses for credit purposes and prepares another  financial statement for calendar year 1987 that it uses for disclosure  to shareholders. Both financial statements are unaudited. The statement  used for credit purposes is B's financial statement with the highest  priority and thus is B's applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section (relating to financial statements  required to be provided to a Federal or other governmental regulator)  that are of equal priority, the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement is determined according to the following priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement required to be provided to the Federal government or  any of its agencies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement required to be provided to a State government or any  of its agencies, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A statement required to be provided to any subdivision of a  state or any agency of a subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Statements of equal priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) and paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this  section, if a taxpayer has two or more financial statements of equal  priority (determined under paragraphs (c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii) and  (c)(3)(iii) of this section), the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement is the statement that results in the greatest amount of  adjusted net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions to the general rule in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A). (1)  In the case of two or more financial statements described in paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section (relating to financial statements required to  be filed with the   SEC) that are of equal priority, a certified audited financial statement  has a higher priority than an unaudited financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of two or more financial statements described in  paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section (relating to other financial  statements) that are of equal priority, a financial statement  accompanied by an auditor's ``review report'' has a higher priority than  another financial statement of otherwise equal priority. For purposes of  this section, an auditor's review report is defined in the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountant Professional Standards, AR  section 100.32. See paragraph (c)(6), Examples and 3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of financial statement for a substantal non-tax purpose. In  order to be an applicable financial statement for purposes of computing  the book income adjustment, a financial statement described in paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(1)(iv) must be used by the taxpayer for credit  purposes, for disclosure to shareholders, or for any other substantial  non-tax purpose. A financial statement is used by a taxpayer if the  taxpayer reasonably anticipates that users of the statement will rely on  it for non-tax purposes. Thus, a financial statement used for the  purpose of computing the book income adjustment is not an applicable  financial statement even if it is provided to shareholders or creditors,  unless the taxpayer reasonably anticipates that users of the statement  will rely on it for non-tax purposes. See paragraph (c)(6), Examples 4,  5, 19 and 20 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicable financial statement of related  corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Applicable financial statement of a consolidated  group. The applicable financial statement of a consolidated group (as  defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) is the financial statement  of the common parent (within the meaning of section 1504(a)(1)) of the  consolidated group that has the highest priority under the rules of  paragraphs (c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii) and (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section. See  paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section for rules relating to adjustments to  net book income of a consolidated group. See paragraph (c)(6), Example 7  of this section. See paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section for rules  relating to the election by the common parent of a consolidated group to  use current earnings and profits to compute net book income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> (1) or (2),  whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Two or more financial statements reporting on the same  corporations. If two or more financial statements of equal priority  report on the same corporations, the consolidated group's applicable  financial statement is determined under the rules of paragraph  (c)(3)(iv) of this section. Thus, the financial statement that results  in the greatest consolidated adjusted net book income is the  consolidated group's applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Two or more financial statements reporting on different  corporations. If two or more financial statements of equal priority  report on different corporations, the consolidated group's applicable  financial statement is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The statement that reflects the greatest amount of gross  receipts attributable to members of the consolidated group, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section, the consolidated group still has financial statements  of equal priority, the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section  apply. See paragraph (c)(6), Examples 7 and 8 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rule for related corporations. If any portion of the net  book income   of a corporation (the ``first corporation'') is included on the  applicable financial statement of a second corporation, but the first  and second corporations are not members of the same consolidated group,  the applicable financial statement of the second corporation is  disregarded when determining the applicable financial statement of the  first corporation. Thus, the applicable financial statement of the first  corporation is the financial statement of highest priority determined  under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section without regard to  the financial statement of the second corporation. Pursuant to paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section, if a separate financial statement is not  prepared by the first corporation, the rules of paragraph (b)(5)  (relating to current earnings and profits) apply. See paragraph (c)(6),  Examples 9 and 10 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Anti-abuse rule. The special rules of this paragraph (c)(5)(i)  will not apply if the taxpayer rearranges its corporate structure or  modifies its financial reporting and the principal purpose of such  action is to use the special rules of this paragraph (c)(5)(i) to reduce  the amount of the book income adjustment. In such cases, the District  Director may, based upon all the facts and circumstances, determine the  taxpayer's applicable financial statement. See paragraph (c)(6),  Examples 13 and 14 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable financial statement of a foreign corporation with a  United States trade or business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The applicable  financial statement of a foreign taxpayer conducting one or more trades  or businesses in the United States is the financial statement prepared  by any such trade or business (or attributable to more than one such  trades or businesses) that has the highest priority as determined under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section. See paragraph (c)(6), Example 15 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rules for applicable financial statement of a trade or  business of a foreign taxpayer--(1) Financial statement prepared under  foreign generally accepted accounting principles. Subject to the rules  of this section, a financial statement prepared by a United States trade  or business using generally accepted accounting principles of a foreign  country may be an applicable financial statement under this paragraph  (c). See paragraph (c)(6), Example 16 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Financial statement denominated in United States dollars. Except  as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, the financial  statement of a United States trade or business must be denominated in  United States dollars in order to be considered the applicable financial  statement of the foreign taxpayer under this paragraph (c). See  paragraph (c)(6), Example 17 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>  (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Two or more financial statements reporting on the same trades or  businesses. If two or more financial statements of equal priority report  on the same United States trades or businesses, the applicable financial  statement of the foreign taxpayer is determined under the rule of  paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. In applying this rule, adjusted  net book income (as defined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section)  shall be used. Thus, the financial statement that results in the  greatest amount of adjusted net book income is the foreign taxpayer's  applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Two or more financial statements reporting on different trades  or businesses. If two or more financial statements of equal priority  report on different United States trades or businesses, the foreign  taxpayer's applicable financial statement is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The financial statement that reflects the greatest amount of  gross receipts attributable to United States trades or businesses, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)(2)(i)</em> of  this section, the foreign taxpayer still has financial statements of  equal priority, the financial statement determined under the   rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (using effectively  connected adjusted net book income).  See paragraph (c)(6), Example 18 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Anti-abuse rules. The special rules of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)  will not apply if a trade or business conducted in the United States by  a foreign taxpayer modifies its financial reporting and the principal  purpose of such action is to reduce the amount of the book income  adjustment. In such cases, the District Director may, based upon all the  facts and circumstances, determine the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement. See paragraph (c)(6), Example 21, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Supplement or amendment to an applicable financial statement-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Excluding a restatement of net book income. An applicable financial  statement includes any supplement or amendment thereto (excluding a  restatement of net book income) for the taxable year that is prepared  and used for a substantial non-tax purpose (within the meaning of  paragraph (c)(4) of this section) prior to the date the taxpayer's  Federal income tax return for the taxable year would be due if the time  for filing were extended under section 6081. For example, a calendar  year taxpayer's applicable financial statement includes any supplement  or amendment prepared and used prior to September 15 of the year  immediately following its taxable year. If a taxpayer files its Federal  income tax return before the issuance of a supplement or amendment to  the applicable financial statement and before the extended due date for  filing under section 6081, the taxpayer must file an amended Federal  income tax return reporting any additional tax that results from  treating the supplement or amendment as part of the applicable financial  statement. A supplement or amendment (excluding restatements of net book  income) to an applicable financial statement after the date specified in  section 6081 is disregarded for purposes of the book income adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Restatement of net book income. If a taxpayer restates net book  income in what otherwise would have been its applicable financial  statement (its ``original financial statement''), referred to in this  section as a ``restatement of net book income,'' prior to the date that  the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for such taxable year would be  due if the time for filing were extended under section 6081, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the financial statement that includes the restated net book  income is of a higher priority than the original financial statement,  the restated financial statement is the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the financial statement that includes the restated net book  income is of equal priority to the original financial statement and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The restatement is attributable to an error (as described in  Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, paragraph 13), the restated  financial statement is the taxpayer's applicable financial statement, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The restatement is not attributable to an error, the original  and restated financial statements will be considered of equal priority,  and paragraph (c)(3)(iv) will apply. Thus, the taxpayer's applicable  financial statement is the financial statement that results in the  greatest amount of adjusted net book income.  See paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section for rules that apply to  restatements occurring after the due date (including the extension under  section 6081) of the return for the taxable year to which the applicable  financial statement relates. See paragraph (c)(6), Examples 11 and 12 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1987, Corporation A only has a financial statement  described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and elects to treat  net book income as equal to its current earnings and profits. In 1988, A  has a certified audited financial statement (as described in paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section). In 1989, A only has a statement described  in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. In 1988, A's certified audited  financial statement is its applicable financial statement. However, in  1989, A is bound by the election it made in 1987 (unless revoked with  the consent of the District Director) and must treat net book income as  equal to its current earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation B prepares two unaudited financial  statements. Both statements are distributed to creditors and are used  for substantial non-tax purposes. The   first financial statement is accompanied by an auditor's review report  while the second statement has no auditor's review report. B has no  other financial statement. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of  this section, the financial statement accompanied by the auditor's  review report is B's applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except the  financial statement accompanied by an auditor's review report is  distributed to shareholders while the other statement is distributed to  creditors, and both statements are used for substantial non-tax  purposes. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, B's  applicable financial statement is the statement distributed to its  creditors. Paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this section does not apply  because the two statements are not of equal priority after applying  paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Corporation C is a closely held corporation with two  shareholders. Both shareholders participate in the business on a day-to- day basis and are aware of the financial status of the business. C  prepares a financial statement that is used by C's two shareholders to  calculate bonuses. The financial statement prepared by C is used for a  substantial non-tax purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Corporation D prepares a financial statement that it only  sends to banks with which D is neither currently doing business nor  negotiating. D does not reasonably anticipate that the financial  statement will be relied on by the banks for any non-tax purpose, and  therefore, for purposes of computing net book income, the financial  statement is not used for a substantial non-tax purpose. The result  would be the same if D sent the statement to a bank whose only  relationship to D is that it holds a mortgage on D's property and D's  rights and obligations under the mortgage are not affected by changes in  its financial condition. The result would also be the same if D sent the  statement to a bank with which D is doing business, and the statement is  not reasonably expected to come to the attention of the bank's employees  who are responsible for D's account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Corporation E and its subsidiaries, F and G are a  consolidated group. Certified audited financial statements are prepared  by EF and by FG. Both statements are used for substantial non-tax  purposes. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the  financial statement that is prepared by EF is the applicable financial  statement of the consolidated group. However, pursuant to paragraph  (d)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an adjustment will be required to include  the adjusted net book income attributable to G. The result would be the  same even if the financial statement prepared by FG is of higher  priority (under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section) than the  statement prepared by E and F.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Corporation H and its subsidiaries I, J, and K are a  consolidated group. Certified audited financial statements are prepared  by H and I and by H, J, and K. Both statements are used for substantial  non-tax purposes. The financial statement prepared by H, J, and K  includes the greater amount of gross receipts attributable to members of  the consolidated group and thus, pursuant to paragraph  (c)(5)(i)(B)(2)(i) of this section, it is the consolidated group's  applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Corporation L and its subsidiary M are a consolidated  group. Corporation L also owns 100 percent of N, a foreign corporation  that is not part of the consolidated group. A certified audited  financial statement prepared by L, M and N discloses gross receipts of  $200, of which $150 is attributable to L and M, and a separate certified  audited financial statement prepared by L and M discloses gross receipts  of $150. Both statements are used for substantial non-tax purposes.  Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section, the consolidated  group's applicable financial statement is the statement prepared by L, M  and N.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Corporation O is 60 percent owned by corporation P and 40  percent owned by corporation Q. Both P and Q prepare financial  statements that are required to be filed with the SEC reflecting their  respective interests in O. O also separately prepares a certified  audited financial statement, or uses a summary of its books and records  for credit purposes. Under paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C), O's separate  statement is its applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Assume the same facts as in Example 9 except that O does  not prepare a separate financial statement or a summary of its books and  records for credit purposes. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this  section, O must treat its net book income as equal to its current  earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Corporation R uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. Initially, R issues its calendar year 1987  financial statement on March 1, 1988. R's adjusted net book income  resulting from this statement is $80. This would be R's applicable  financial statement for 1987, but for the restatement described in the  next sentence. On September 1, 1988, R restates its 1987 financial  statement to correct an error (as described in Accounting Principles  Board Opinion No. 20, paragraph 13). The restated financial statement is  of the same priority as the initial financial statement. The restatement  results in adjusted net book income for calendar year 1987 of $50.  Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2)(i) of this section, the restated  financial statement is treated as R's 1987 applicable financial  statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Assume the same facts as in Example (11), except that R  restates its financial statement in order to reflect a change in  accounting method. Since the restatement does not result from an error,  paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Pursuant  to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section, R's 1987 applicable  financial statement is the financial statement for 1987 that results in  the greater amount of adjusted net book income. Thus, R's March 1, 1988  financial statement is treated as its 1987 applicable financial  statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Corporation S, which is not a member of an affiliated  group, uses a calendar year for both financial accounting and tax  purposes. S's 1987 applicable financial statement is a certified audited  financial statement. On January 1, 1988, S transfers all of its assets  subject to liabilities to T, a newly created subsidiary that is 100  percent owned by S. The principal purpose of the transfer is to use the  special rules of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to reduce the  adjusted net book income of S. For calendar year 1988, T prepares and  uses a certified audited financial statement. Since S's only asset is  its investment in T, S does not prepare a financial statement for  calendar year 1988. In addition, since S is only a holding company, T's  1988 certified audited financial statement reports the same net book  income that would have been reported on a consolidated ST financial  statement. If paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D) of this section does not apply,  ST's 1988 applicable financial statement is the financial statement of S  (the parent of the consolidated group) with the highest priority. Under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, since S does not have a financial  statement in 1988, the net book income of the ST consolidated group is  ordinarily deemed to equal the aggregate earnings and profits of the  members of the consolidated group. However, given these facts, the  District Director may determine that the 1988 certified audited  financial statement of T is the 1988 applicable financial statement of  the ST consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. The facts are the same as in Example 13, except that S  has owned 100 percent of T for several years prior to calendar year  1987. In addition, prior to 1987, ST prepared a consolidated certified  audited financial statement. For calendar year 1987, ST does not prepare  a consolidated certified audited financial statement. Instead, T  prepares and uses a certified audited financial statement while S does  not prepare a financial statement. The principal purpose of the change  in financial reporting is to use the special rules of paragraph  (c)(5)(i) of this section to reduce the adjusted net book income of the  ST consolidated group. Given these facts, the District Director may  determine that the 1987 certified audited financial statement of T is  the 1987 applicable financial statement of the ST consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Corporation U is a foreign corporation incorporated in  A. U is a calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax  purposes. U actively conducts three real estate businesses, X, Y and Z,  in the United States. In 1987, X prepares a certified audited financial  statement that it provides to its United States creditor. In addition,  in 1987, X, Y and Z each prepare unaudited financial statements that  they provide to U for incorporation in U's worldwide financial  statement. Under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, U's applicable  financial statement is the certified audited financial statement  prepared by X. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(7) of this section, an  adjustment is required to include any of U's effectively connected net  book income that is not included in X's certified audited financial  statement (i.e., the effectively connected net book income attributable  to Y and Z).</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. Corporation A is a foreign corporation incorporated in  Z. A is a calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax  purposes. A actively conducts a real estate business, B, in the United  States. B prepares a certified audited financial statement for 1987  using the accounting principles of Z that it provides to A for  incorporation into A's worldwide financial statement. In addition, B  prepares a review statement for 1987 using United States generally  accepted accounting principles that it provides to its United States  creditors. Both the certified statement and the review statement are  denominated in United States dollars. Under paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) and  (c)(5)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, the financial statement prepared under  the accounting principles of Z is the applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. Assume the same facts as in Example (16) except that  amounts are reported on B's certified audited financial statement in the  currency of Z and amounts are reported on B's review statement in United  States dollars. Since the review statement is denominated in United  States dollars, under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(2) of this section, it is  the applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. Corporation C is a foreign corporation incorporated in  Z. C is a calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax  purposes. C actively conducts two real estate businesses, D and E, in  the United States. D and E each separately prepare a certified audited  financial statement for 1987 that they provide to their United States  creditors. D's financial statement reports gross receipts of $100. E's  financial statement reports gross receipts of $200. Under paragraph  (c)(5)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, E's certified audited financial  statement is the applicable financial statement and must be adjusted  under the rules of paragraph (d)(7) of   this section to include effectively connected book income attributable  to D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. F is a foreign corporation incorporated in X. F is a  calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax purposes. F  actively conducts a banking business, G, in the United States. G has  been engaged in business in the United States since 1977. For the years  1977 through 1986, G did not prepare a separate financial statement.  However, each year G provided F with its books, records and other raw  financial data. F used this data in preparing its worldwide financial  statement. G provides F with its 1987 books and records on January 5,  1988, in accordance with its historic practice. On February 15, 1988, G  prepares an unaudited financial statement for calendar year 1987 that it  provides to F. The principal purpose of creating this financial  statement is to reduce net book income. Under these facts, the financial  statement provided by G is not intended to be reasonably relied upon by  F in preparing its worldwide financial statement. Therefore, for  purposes of computing net book income, G's financial statement has not  been used for a substantial non-tax purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Example 20. Assume the same facts as in Example 19 except that for  purposes of preparing F's 1987 worldwide financial statement, G does not  provide F with any raw financial data, and G only provides F with an  audited financial statement that is prepared for a substantial non-tax  purpose. Under these facts, the financial statement provided by G is  intended to be relied upon by F in preparing its worldwide financial  statement. Therefore, for purposes of computing net book income, G's  financial statement has been used for a substantial non-tax purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Example 21. Corporation H is a foreign corporation incorporated in  I. H is a calendar year taxpayer for both financial accounting and tax  purposes. H actively conducts a real estate business, J, in the United  States. For the years 1976 through 1986, J prepared a certified audited  financial statement using United States dollars that it provided to H.  In 1987, J prepares a certified audited financial statement using the  currency of I. The principal purpose of the modification of J's  financial reporting is to reduce the amount of the book income  adjustment. Given these facts, the District Director may determine that  J's 1987 certified audited financial statement prepared in the currency  of I is J's applicable financial statement for 1987, and such statement  must be converted into United States dollars based upon the translation  used to prepare the certified audited financial statement in the  currency of I. Accordingly, the effectively connected net book income of  J for 1987 is the effectively connected net book income reported on the  financial statement that has been converted into United States dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments to net book income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Adjusted net  book income is computed by making the adjustments described in this  paragraph (d) to net book income (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section). No adjustment may be made to net book income except as  provided in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Historic practice. For purposes of this  paragraph (d), historic practice is defined as an accounting practice  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Was used consistently by the taxpayer for each of the 2 years  immediately preceding its first taxable year beginning after 1986, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Was used on the financial statement that would have been the  taxpayer's applicable financial statement (as determined under paragraph  (c) of this section) for each of the 2 years immediately preceding its  first taxable year beginning after 1986 if section 56(f), as amended by  the Tax Reform Act of 1986, had been in effect.  Thus, in order for a calendar year corporation to have an historic  practice in 1987, the corporation must have used the accounting practice  in its 1985 and 1986 financial statements. However, to be treated as  used for purposes of this paragraph, an accounting practice must have  been used prior to April 23, 1987. For example, an accounting practice  that is first used after April 23, 1987, in a restatement of a  taxpayer's 1985 and 1986 financial statements is not the taxpayer's  historic practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accounting literature. For purposes of this paragraph (d), the  term ``accounting literature'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as defined in  the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Professional  Standards, AU Sec.  411.05, paragraphs (a) through (c), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pronouncements by the SEC including, but not limited to,  Regulations S-X, SEC Financial Reporting Releases, and SEC Staff  Accounting Bulletins,  that are effective for the accounting period covered by the applicable  financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>. See paragraph (d)(4)(vii) of this section for  an adjustment for certain deferred foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for certain foreign taxes. Net book income is not  adjusted to disregard taxes imposed by a foreign country or possession  of the United States if the taxpayer does not choose to take the  benefits of section 901 (relating to the foreign tax credit) with  respect to these taxes for the taxable year. The rule in the preceding  sentence only applies to the amount of taxes the taxpayer deducts in the  current taxable year under section 164(a). See paragraph (d)(3)(iv),  Example 4 of this section. Net book income also is not adjusted to  disregard foreign taxes that cannot be claimed as a credit (other than  by virtue of a foreign tax credit limitation). Thus, a taxpayer does not  add back to net book income any taxes it is not allowed to claim as a  credit against its United States income tax liability because of section  245(a)(8), 901(j), 907(b) or 908 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain valuation adjustments. Income tax expense under  paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not include valuation  adjustments such as the valuation adjustments related to purchase  accounting described in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.  16, paragraph 89. However, income tax expense does include the tax  associated with any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of any  asset the basis of which was adjusted under paragraph 89 of Opinion 16.  See paragraph (d)(3)(iv), Example 6 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A has $120 of net book income. In calculating  net book income, A has deducted $20 of state income tax expense and $60  of Federal income tax expense. Assuming there are no other adjustments  to net book income, A's adjusted net book income is $180 ($120 of net  book income + $60 of Federal income tax expense). Pursuant to paragraph  (d)(3)(i) of this section, no adjustment is made for the state income  tax expense.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A also  has a net extraordinary item of $40. Thus, A has net book income of $160  ($120 + $40). The $40 net extraordinary item is composed of a $70 gross  extraordinary item less $30 of Federal income tax expense. Assuming  there are no other adjustments to net book income, A's adjusted net book  income is $250 ($160 of net book income + $60 of Federal income tax  expense on book income other than the extraordinary item + $30 of  Federal income tax expense on the extraordinary item).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that in  calculating A's $120 of net book income, A has $50 of Federal income tax  expense and $10 of foreign income tax expense. The $10 of foreign income  tax expense results from a foreign branch and is composed of $7 of  current foreign income tax expense and $3 of deferred foreign income tax  expense. A chooses to take the benefits of the foreign tax credit under  section 901 for the current taxable year. Assuming there are no other  adjustments to net book income, A's adjusted net book income is $180  ($120 of net book income + $50 of Federal income tax expense + $10 of  foreign income tax expense).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that A does  not choose to take the benefits of the foreign tax credit in the current  taxable year and instead deducts the $7 of current foreign income tax  paid. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, net book income  is not adjusted for the $7 of current foreign income tax expense.  However, net book income is adjusted for the $3 of deferred foreign  income tax expense. Thus, assuming there are no other adjustments to net  book income, D's adjusted net book income is $173 ($120 of net book  income + $50 of Federal income tax expense + $3 of deferred foreign  income tax expenses).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. In 1987, corporation B only has a financial statement  described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. B elects pursuant to  paragraph (c)(2) of this section to treat net book income as equal to  its current earnings and profits. B's current earnings and profits in  1987 is $60, after reduction for $40 of Federal income tax (see  paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of   this section, B must make a $40 adjustment to net book income. Thus,  assuming no other adjustments to net book income, B's 1987 adjusted net  book income is $100 ($60 of net book income + $40 adjustment for Federal  income taxes).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Corporation A acquires assets from corporation B in a  transaction where the tax basis of B's assets will carry over to A. For  financial accounting purposes, A will account for the acquisition in  accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16. One of  the assets acquired from B has an appraised value of $10,000. However,  because the tax basis of B's assets will carry over to A, A's tax basis  in the asset is only $7,000. Given these facts, APB Opinion No. 16,  paragraph 89 requires that the asset be recorded at $10,000 less the tax  effect of the difference between the appraised value and the tax basis.  Assuming a 30 percent tax rate for A, the asset would be recorded at  $9,100 ($10,000 appraised value--($3,000 difference between the  appraised value and the tax basis x 30 percent)). If A sells the asset  for $10,000, A will recognize a book gain of $900 with respect to the  sale (assuming the asset is not amortized for book purposes). However, A  will also have income tax expense of $900 (($10,000 sales proceeds-- $7,000 tax basis) x 30 percent) with respect to the sale. Thus, A will  have no net book income from the sale. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii)  of this section, A's income tax expense includes the $900 of income tax  expense attributable to the effects of the valuation adjustment made in  accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, paragraph 89. As a result, A's  adjusted net book income with respect to its asset sale is $900 ($0 of  net book income + $900 adjustment for income tax expense).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments to prevent omission or duplication--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  In order to prevent omissions or duplications, net book income must be  adjusted for the items described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) through  (d)(4)(vii) of this section and for such other items as approved or  required by the Commissioner in published guidance. Except as provided  in this paragraph (d), a taxpayer may not adjust net book income to  prevent omission or duplication of items. See paragraph (d)(4)(viii),  Example 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for depreciating an asset below its cost. Net book  income must be adjusted to exclude depreciation or amortization expense  to the extent such expense exceeds the asset's financial accounting  historical cost (``excess depreciation''). However, no adjustment is  required if excess depreciation has been the taxpayer's historic  practice (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section) or if the  excess depreciation is properly attributable to negative salvage value  (i.e., where the cost of removal or clean-up exceeds the salvage value).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consolidated group using current earnings and profits. In the  case of a consolidated group that uses its aggregate current earnings  and profits as net book income (as determined under the rules of  paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section), the current earnings and profits  of the group is the aggregate of the current earnings and profits of  each member of the group. In determining aggregate current earnings and  profits, the adjustments described in Sec.  1.1502-33 apply except for  the adjustment for intercompany distributions with respect to stock and  obligations or members of the group described in Sec.  1.1502-33(c)(1)  and the investment adjustment described in Sec.  1.1502-33(c)(4)(ii)(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Restatement of a prior year's applicable financial statement-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a taxpayer restates an applicable financial statement  and as a result, the net book income for a taxable year is restated  after the last date that the taxpayer could have filed its Federal  income tax return for such taxable year (if it had obtained an extension  of time under section 6081 of the Code), net book income for the first  successor year (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(D) of this section)  must be adjusted by that part of the cumulative effect of the  restatement on net book income attributable to taxable years beginning  after 1986. To the extent that the cumulative effect of the restatement  on net book income includes a tax component, paragraph (d)(3) of this  section may apply. See paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section for rules  relating to the restatement of an applicable financial statement prior  to the date the taxpayer's return for the taxable year would be due if  the time for filing the return is extended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reconciliation of owner's equity in applicable financial  statements. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The beginning balance of owner's equity on the taxpayer's  applicable financial statement for the current taxable year is different  than the ending   balance of owner's equity on the taxpayer's applicable financial  statement for the preceding taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer is not otherwise subject to the restatement rules  in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section,  the taxpayer will be deemed to have restated its applicable financial  statement for the preceding year and paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this  section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Use of different priority applicable financial statements in  consecutive taxable years. If the priority of a taxpayer's applicable  financial statement (as determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)  of this section) for the current taxable year is different than the  priority of the taxpayer's applicable financial statement for the  preceding taxable year, the taxpayer shall be required to adjust net  book income to the extent required under the rules of either paragraph  (d)(4)(iv) (A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> First successor year defined. The ``first successor year'' is  the first taxable year for which the taxpayer could have timely filed a  return if it had obtained an extension of time under section 6081 of the  Code after the restatement occurs. For example, if a calendar year  corporation restates and uses its 1987 applicable financial statement  between September 16, 1988 and September 15, 1989, any adjustment  resulting from the restatement will be made in the taxpayer's 1988  Federal income tax return. If the restatement occurs prior to September  15, 1988, the rules of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Exceptions. (1) No adjustment is made under paragraph  (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section for a restatement prepared in accordance  with APB Opinion No. 16, paragraph 53, requiring restatements of  financial statements to reflect the combined operation of corporations  combined in a pooling transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In order to prevent duplication of an adjustment, an adjustment  otherwise required under paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) of this section may be  decreased to take into account an adjustment previously made under the  disclosure rules described in paragraph (d)(5) of the section. See  paragraph (d)(4)(viii), Example 3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> to the extent any  portion of the subpart F income was recognized during taxable years  beginning before 1987. See Example 5 of paragraph (d)(4)(viii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> to the extent the separate  corporation's income is attributable to taxable years beginning before  1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em>  to the extent the foreign taxes were deferred during taxable years  beginning before 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. In 1986, A's financial statement included a  $100 financial accounting loss for a plant shutdown. A could not deduct  the loss on its 1986 Federal income tax return. In 1987, A deducts the  loss from the 1986 plant shutdown in its 1987 Federal income tax return.  As a result, A's 1987 adjusted net book   income exceeds its 1987 pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income by $100 (an amount equal to the deduction for the 1986 plant  shutdown). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, A cannot  make an adjustment to net book income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation B uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. B issues its calendar year 1987 applicable  financial statement on March 1, 1988. The applicable financial statement  reports net book income for the calendar years 1985 through 1987 of $50,  $70, and $80, respectively. On March 1, 1989 when it issues its calendar  year 1988 applicable financial statement, B restates its 1985, 1986, and  1987 applicable financial statements. The restatement results from a  change in accounting method that is made during calendar year 1988.  After restatement, B's net book income for 1985, 1986, and 1987 is $60,  $80, and $90, respectively. Based upon these facts, the cumulative  effect of the restatement on B's net book income for years prior to 1988  is $30. However, since $20 of the cumulative effective is attributable  to years beginning before 1987, B's 1988 net book income is increased by  only $10 ($30-$20). If the cumulative effect includes a tax adjustment,  see paragraph (d)(3) of this section</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts for Corporation B as in Example 2,  except that B's 1987 net book income of $80 is increased by $10 for  purposes of B's 1987 Federal income tax return. The $10 adjustment is  made pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section relating to  disclosure in the accountant's opinion. Specifically, the accountant's  opinion on B's 1987 applicable financial statement disclosed that if D  had used a certain accounting method, B's 1987 net book income would  have been $90 rather than $80. The restatement of B's 1987 applicable  financial statement on March 1, 1988 results entirely from B changing to  the accounting method referred to in the 1987 accountant's opinion.  Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(E)(2) of this section, no adjustment is  made to B's 1988 net book income as a result of the restatement of B's  1987 applicable financial statement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that when A  issues its 1987 applicable financial statement it also restates the net  book income reported on its 1986 financial statement to exclude the $100  loss attributable to the plant shutdown. Furthermore, the $100 loss from  the plant shutdown is included in A's 1987 net book income as reported  on its 1987 applicable financial statement. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)  of this section, no adjustment is made to A's 1987 net book income as a  result of the restatement of A's 1986 net book income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Corporation D is a domestic corporation. D owns ten  percent of the issued and outstanding stock of corporation F, a foreign  corporation. D and F file separate financial statements and federal  income tax returns, both on a calendar-year basis. F is a controlled  foreign corporation as defined in section 957. In 1987, D includes ten  percent of F's subpart F income in its income under section 951. F makes  no actual distributions to D in that year, and D's applicable financial  statement includes the earnings of F only when actual distributions are  made. See paragraph (d)(6)(i)(A) of this section. In 1987, D must adjust  its net book income under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section to  include ten percent of F's subpart F income. In 1988, F makes an actual  distribution to D which qualifies for the exclusion of section 959. D  includes this actual distribution as income on its applicable financial  statement for 1987.

The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. For calendar years 1984 through 1986, A  used the cash method of accounting on its financial statement and  disclosed in a footnote the net income or loss that would have resulted  if the accrual method of accounting had been used. A's 1987 net book  income, as reported on its 1987 applicable financial statement, is $100  and is calculated on the cash method of accounting. In addition, a  footnote in A's 1987 applicable financial statement states that A's 1987  net book income would have been $30 greater had the accrual method of  accounting been used. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(2) of this  section, A's 1987 footnote disclosure is not considered specifically  authorized by the accounting literature. However, since A made such  disclosure for calendar years 1985 and 1986, the 1987 disclosure is in  accordance with A's historic practice, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i)  of this section. Since A satisfies the   exception described in paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A)(2) of this section, no  adjustment is made to A's 1987 net book income for the footnote  disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

Since the equity adjustment is specifically  authorized in the accounting literature, C satisfies the exception  described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(1) of this section, and no  adjustment is made to C's 1987 net book income for the $50 equity  adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts for coporation D as in Example (3),  except that D's equity adjustment is for foreign currency transaction  gains instead of foreign currency translation gains. Pursuant to FASB  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, foreign currency  transaction gains (as compared with foreign currency translation gains)  are included in the income statement rather than in equity. In addition,  in 1985 and 1986, D included foreign currency transaction gains in its  income statement. Since D does not satisfy either of the exceptions  described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, D's 1987 adjusted  net book income is $250 ($200 of net book income plus $50 equity  adjustment).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Corporation E uses a calendar year for both financial  accounting and tax purposes. E's net book income for 1988 is $100. The  $100 of net book income includes $30 of financial accounting loss  attributable to a cumulative adjustment as of January 1, 1988, resulting  from a change in E's accounting method. The $30 cumulative loss is  disclosed in E's 1988 applicable financial statement. If E had made the  accounting method change in calendar year 1987, the cumulative loss as  of January 1, 1987 would have been $20. Based upon the above facts, E  must increase net book income by $20 to disregard that portion of the  cumulative adjustment attributable to years beginning before 1987. Thus,  assuming no other adjustments to net book income, E's adjusted net book  income for 1988 is $120 ($100 plus $20).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adjustments applicable to related corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consolidated  returns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of  this section, the book income adjustment with respect to a consolidated  group (as described under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) is computed  based on the consolidated adjusted net book income (as defined in  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section). In the case of any corporation  that is not included in the consolidated group, consolidated adjusted  net book income of the consolidated group shall include only the sum of  the dividends received from such other corporation and other amounts  includible in gross income under this chapter with respect to the  earnings of such other corporation.

Consolidated net book income reported on the applicable  financial statement (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this  section) shall be adjusted to include net book income attributable to a  corporation that is included in the consolidated group but is not  included in the applicable financial statement. Net book income for the  corporation not included in the applicable financial statement of the  consolidated group is the net book income reported on such corporation's  applicable financial statement (determined under the rules of paragraph  (c) of this section and adjusted under the rules of this paragraph (d)).  The adjusted net book income of such corporation must be consolidated  with the adjusted net book income of other members of the consolidated  group and appropriate adjustments, including consolidating elimination  entries, must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments to net book income for minority interests.  Consolidated net book income must be adjusted to include income or loss  allocated to minority interests in members of the consolidated group.

Any dividend received from a corporation  eligible for the credit provided by section 936 (relating to the  possession tax credit) shall be included in adjusted net book income.  For example, assume corporation A owns 100 percent of B, a section 936  corporation, and B pays a $100 dividend to A. Furthermore, assume that  of the $100 dividend, $15 of withholding tax is paid to a possession of  the United States, so that A only receives $85 from the dividend.

The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation A and its 100 percent owned subsidiary B and  its 90 percent owned subsidiary C are a consolidated group. A also owns  100 percent of D, a foreign corporation. ABC's applicable financial  statement is a certified audited financial statement that includes A, B,  C and D. The net book income reported on the statement excludes $10 of  C's net book income that is attributable to the 10 percent minority  interest in C held outside of the consolidated group. Pursuant to  paragraph (d)(6)(i)(B)(2) of this section, net book income of the  consolidated group must be adjusted to include the $10 of net book  income attributable to the minority interest in C. In addition, pursuant  to paragraph (d)(6)(i)(C) of this section, net book income shown on the  applicable financial statement must be adjusted to eliminate the net  book income attributable to D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation E owns 100 percent of F, a finance  subsidiary, and EF are a consolidated group. Since F is a finance  subsidiary E's applicable financial statement accounts for F under the  equity method of accounting. F also prepares a separate financial  statement that is of equal or higher priority than E's applicable  financial statement. In 1987, E's applicable financial statement  includes $60 of equity income from F. The $60 of equity income reflects  a reduction for $40 of Federal income tax expense. Thus, E's equity  income from F prior to the reduction for Federal income tax expense, is  $100 ($60 + $40). Since E's applicable financial statement includes E's  equity income in F, F's separate financial statement is not relevant for  determining the adjusted net book income of the EF consolidated group.  However, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(6)(i)(B)(3) of this  section, E is required to adjust its equity income in F by the $40 of  Federal income tax expense attributable to F. Thus, assuming there are  no other adjustments, E's adjusted net book income with respect to F is  $100.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as Example (2), except that E  reports its equity income in F without reduction for F's Federal income  tax expense. The $40 of Federal income tax expense attributable to F is  combined with E's Federal income tax expense. Assuming no other  adjustments, E's adjusted net book income with respect to F is $100.  Thus, E's adjusted net book income with respect to F will be the same  regardless of whether E's equity income in F is reported before or after  taxes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. A, a domestic corporation, uses a calendar year for both  financial accounting and tax purposes. On January 1, 1987, A purchases  100 percent of F, a foreign corporation, for $100. F does not file a  Federal income tax return and A does not recognize any taxable income  with respect to F under section 951 (relating to controlled foreign  corporations). In its applicable financial statement, A accounts for its  investment in F under the equity method of accounting. Thus, A's initial  investment in F is $100. During calendar year 1987, F has $50 of net  book income but makes no dividend payments to A. Under the equity method  of accounting, A's net book income includes the $50 of net book income  attributable to A's net book investment in F. Thus, A's investment in F  is increased to $150. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(6)(i)(C) of this  section, A's net book income is adjusted to eliminate the $50 of net  book income attributable to F. On January 1, 1988, A sells F for $150.  Since A's investment in F under the equity method of accounting is $150,  A's net book income for 1988 will not include any gain on the sale of F.  However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(6)(iv), A's 1988 net book income must  be increased by $50, the amount of net book income previously eliminated  with respect to A's investment in F. The result would be the same if  instead of accounting for its investment in F under the equity method of  accounting, A and F prepare a consolidated financial statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Adjustments for foreign taxpayers with a United States trade or  business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)   of this section, the book income adjustment with respect to a foreign  taxpayer with a United States trade or business is computed based on the  effectively connected net book income of the foreign taxpayer (as  defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section). The net book income  amount reported on the applicable financial statement of the foreign  taxpayer (as determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section) must  be adjusted to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include effectively connected net book income attributable to a  trade or business conducted in the United States by the foreign taxpayer  that is not reported on the applicable financial statement.

B  prepares a certified audited financial statement that it provides to its  United States creditor. C does not prepare a financial statement. The  certified audited financial statement prepared by B is treated as A's  applicable financial statement under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this  section. B's certified audited financial statement, in addition to  amounts related to the conduct of its real estate business, also reports  income received from its investment in United States securities,  unrelated to its conduct of business in the United States that does not  qualify as effectively connected net book income. In order to determine  A's effectively connected net book income from the net book income  reported on the applicable financial statement, such statement must be  adjusted to exclude amounts attributable to the securities. In addition,  book income or loss attributable to C, to the extent effectively  connected to its business in the United States, must be included in the  effectively connected net book income reported on B's financial  statement. Since C does not have a financial statement, C's effectively  connected net book income is determined by computing its effectively  connected earnings and profits under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Adjustment for corporations subject to subchapter F.

In addition, net book  income is reduced by expenses payable under either section 7(i) or  section 7(j) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1606  (i) and (j)) only when deductions for such expenses are allowed for tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insurance companies.

Redesignated and amended by  T.D. 8138, 52 FR 15309, Apr. 28, 1987]     Sec.  1.56A-2  Deferral of tax liability in case of certain net operating losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 56(b) provides for the deferral of liability  for the minimum tax where, for the taxable year, the taxpayer has--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A net operating loss for such taxable year any portion of which  (under sec. 172) remains as a net operating loss carryover to a  succeeding taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Items of tax preference in excess of the minimum tax exemptions  (hereinafter referred to as ``excess tax preferences'').  In such a case, an amount of tax equal to the lesser of the tax imposed  under section 56(a) (after allowance of the retirement income credit to  the extent that such credit cannot be used against the other taxes  imposed by chapter 1) or 10 percent of the amount of the net operating  loss carryover described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is  deferred. Such amount is not treated as tax imposed in such taxable  year, but is treated as tax imposed in the succeeding taxable year or  years in which the net operating loss is used as provided in paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section. Deferral will result in the above case  regardless of the character of the tax preference items. Thus, for  example, if the taxpayer has $1,030,000 of items of tax preference,  including the stock option item of tax preference, and a $750,000 net  operating loss available for carryover to subsequent taxable years, the  amount of tax imposed for the taxable year under section 56(a) is  $100,000 and $75,000 is deferred by application of section 56(b).  Therefore, only $25,000 is treated as tax imposed for the taxable year.  The provisions of this section are applicable in the case of a net  operating loss or comparable item such as an operations loss under  section 812 and an unused loss as defined in section 825(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> in subsequent years exceed the amount of the tax that was deferred  in the loss year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Priority of reduction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a portion of a net operating loss  is attributable to an amount of excess tax preferences, such portion is  considered to reduce taxable income in succeeding taxable years only  after the other portion (if any) of such net operating loss is used to  reduce taxable income. Accordingly, if the amount of a net operating  loss which may be carried to succeeding taxable years is reduced because  of a modification required to be made pursuant to section 172(b)(2),  such reduction is to be considered to be first from that portion of the  net operating loss that is attributable to excess tax preferences. If a  portion of a net operating loss carryover which is attributable to an  amount of excess tax preferences is not used to reduce taxable income in  any succeeding taxable year, no minimum tax will be imposed with respect  to such portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of Sec.  1.58-7), the amount of such deductions is  not included in the portion of the net operating loss not attributable  to excess tax preferences.

The other portion of the net operating loss is increased  by the amount of suspense preferences which reduce taxable income in  subsequent taxable years but are not converted to actual items of tax  preference (or are so converted but   used against the minimum tax exemption of the loss year). See Sec.   1.58-7(c)(1)(iii) example 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiple net operating loss carryovers. In determining whether a  net operating loss is used to reduce taxable income in a taxable year to  which two or more net operating losses are carried, the ordering rules  of section 172(b) and the regulations thereunder are to be applied.  Thus, for example, the portion of a net operating loss carried over from  an earlier taxable year which is attributable to an amount of excess tax  preference is used to reduce taxable income in the carryover year before  any portion of any other net operating loss carried over or back from a  taxable year subsequent to the earlier taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1970, A, a calendar year taxpayer, who is a single  individual, has $180,000 of items of tax preference, a $150,000 net  operating loss of which $100,000 may be carried forward, and no tax  liability under chapter 1 without regard to the minimum tax. His minimum  tax computed under section 56(a) is $15,000 (10 percent times ($180,000  minus $30,000)). Under section 56(b)(1) an amount equal to the lesser of  the amount determined under section 56(a) ($15,000) or 10 percent of the  net operating loss which may be carried forward ($10,000) is treated as  a deferred liability. Thus, his minimum tax liability for 1970 is $5,000  ($15,000 minimum tax under section 56(a) minus $10,000 deferred tax  liability under section 56(b)). If, in 1971, he has $80,000 of taxable  income before the deduction for the 1970 net operating loss, his minimum  tax liability is $8,000 (10 percent of the amount by which the net  operating loss carryforward from 1970 reduces taxable income) plus any  minimum tax liability resulting from items of tax preference arising in  1971. If, by reason of the modifications provided by section 172(b)(2),  no portion of the 1970 net operating loss remains as a carryover from  1971, no further minimum tax liability will result from the items of tax  preference arising in 1970.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1970, A, a calendar year taxpayer who is a single  individual, has $90,000 of items of tax preference, a $100,000 net  operating loss available for carryover to future taxable years, no net  operating loss carryovers from prior taxable years, and no tax liability  under chapter 1 without regard to the minimum tax. His minimum tax  computed under section 56(a) is $6,000 (10 percent times ($90,000 minus  $30,000)). Under section 56(b)(1) an amount equal to the lesser of the  amount determined under section 56(a) ($6,000) or 10 percent of the net  operating loss subject to carryforward ($10,000) is treated as a  deferred liability. Thus, A owes no minimum tax in 1970 and the entire  $6,000 of minimum tax liability is deferred. Under section 56(b)(2), the  portion of the net operating loss attributable to the excess tax  preferences described in section 56(b)(1)(B) is $60,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In 1971, A has $25,000 of taxable income before the deduction  for the 1970 net operating loss. Thus, in 1971, A has no minimum tax  liability attributable to the items of tax preference arising in 1970  since, by application of section 56(b)(3), the portion of the 1970 net  operating loss carryforward not attributable to the excess described in  section 56(b)(1)(B), or $40,000, is considered applied against taxable  income before the remaining portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(B)</em> and the remaining $35,000  of reduction in taxable income is considered attributable to such  excess. A's 1972 minimum tax attributable to items of tax preference  arising in 1970 is, therefore, $3,500 (10 percent times $35,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In 1973, A has $80,000 of taxable income before the deduction  for the 1970 net operating loss. The remaining $25,000 of the 1970 net  operating loss carryforward is used to reduce taxable income in 1973.  Thus, A's 1973 minimum tax liability attributable to items of tax  preference arising in 1970 is $2,500 (10 percent times $25,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 1971, M Corporation, a Western Hemisphere trade  corporation (as defined in sec. 921), reporting on a calendar year basis  has $20,000 of taxable income after all deductions including the Western  Hemisphere trade deduction allowable under section 922 in the amount of  $30,000. In 1970, M Corporation had a net operating loss of $100,000 all  of which was available for carryover to 1971 and $60,000 of which was  attributable to excess tax preferences. In computing the amount of the  1970 net operating loss carried over to 1972 pursuant to section 172(b),  the 1971 Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction is not taken  into account. Thus, M Corporation's recomputed income under section  172(b) is $50,000 ($20,000 taxable income plus $30,000 Western  Hemisphere trade corporation deduction). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of  this section, $20,000 of the $40,000 portion of the 1970 net operating  loss not attributable to excess tax preferences is considered to reduce  taxable income in 1971 and $30,000 of the $60,000 portion of the 1970  net operating loss attributable to excess tax preferences is considered  reduced   pursuant to section 172(b)(2). Thus, M Corporation has no 1971 minimum  tax attributable to items of tax preference arising in 1970. Of the  $50,000 remaining of the 1970 net operating loss, $30,000 is  attributable to excess tax preference.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 1972, A, a calendar year taxpayer who is a single  individual, has $25,000 of taxable income resulting from $50,000 of net  long-term capital gains. In 1971, A had a net operating loss of $100,000  all of which is available to carryover to 1972 and $60,000 of which is  attributable to excess tax preferences. By application of section 172(b)  only $50,000 of the 1971 net operating loss is carried over to 1973.  Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, $25,000 of the $40,000  portion of the 1971 net operating loss not attributable to excess tax  preferences is considered to reduce taxable income in 1972. Of the  $50,000 remaining of the 1971 net operating loss, $15,000 is not  attributable to excess tax preferences and $35,000 is attributable to  excess tax preferences. Thus, the $25,000 section 1202 deduction, in  effect, reduces the portion of the 1971 net operating loss attributable  to excess tax preferences. Because a net operating loss carryover is  reduced to the extent of any section 1202 deduction, section 1202  deductions do not normally produce a tax benefit in such circumstances  and, pursuant to Sec.  1.57-4, would not be treated as items of tax  preference. However, in this case, to the extent the portion of the 1971  net operating loss carryover attributable to excess tax preferences is  reduced by reason of the section 1202 deduction, such deduction does  result in a tax benefit to the taxpayer and is, therefore, treated as an  item of tax preference in 1971.

For fiscal 1969- 1970 the taxpayer has $180,000 of items of tax preference and a $50,000  net operating loss. In fiscal year 1970-1971, the taxpayer uses the full  net operating loss carryover from 1969-1970 to reduce his taxable income  by $50,000. Thus, without regard to the proration rules applicable under  this section, the taxpayer's minimum tax liability for items of tax  preference arising in 1969-1970 is $15,000, i.e., 10 percentx($180,000- $30,000), of which $5,000, i.e., 10 percentx$50,000, is deferred until  1970-1971 under the principles of section 56(b) and section 1.56A-2.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989, the  alternative minimum taxable income of any taxpayer described in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section is increased by the adjustment for  adjusted current earnings.

Nonetheless, P is not permitted a negative adjustment because  P had no prior increases in its alternative minimum taxable income due  to an adjustment for adjusted current earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In 1991, P has a positive adjustment of $225,000 (75 percent of  the $300,000 excess of adjusted current earnings over pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income). P is not allowed to use the prior  year's excess of pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income over  adjusted current earnings to reduce its 1991 positive adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In 1992, P is permitted a negative adjustment of $75,000, the  full amount of 75 percent of the $100,000 excess of pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income over adjusted current earnings for  the taxable year. This is because P's prior cumulative increases in  alternative minimum taxable income due to the positive adjustments for  adjusted current earnings exceed the negative adjustment for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In 1993, P has a potential negative adjustment (before the  cumulative limitation) of $300,000 (75 percent of the $400,000 excess of  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income over adjusted current  earnings). P's net cumulative increases in alternative minimum taxable  income due to the adjustment for adjusted current earnings are $150,000  ($225,000 increase in 1991, less $75,000 decrease in 1992). Thus, P's  negative adjustment in 1993 is limited to $150,000. P may not use the  remaining portion ($150,000) of the negative adjustment for 1993 to  reduce positive adjustments in other taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Negative amounts. In determining whether an excess exists under  paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, a positive amount exceeds a  negative amount by the sum of the absolute numbers, and a smaller  negative amount exceeds a larger negative amount by the difference  between the absolute numbers. Thus, for example, a positive amount of  adjusted current earnings of $30 exceeds a negative amount (or loss) of  pre-adjustment AMTI of $10 by the sum of the absolute numbers, or $40  (30+10). Accordingly, the adjustment for adjusted current earnings would  be 75 percent of $40, or $30. In contrast, a negative amount of adjusted  current earnings of $10 exceeds a negative amount (or loss) of pre- adjustment alternative minimum taxable income of $30 by the difference  between the absolute numbers, or $20 (30-10). Accordingly, the  adjustment for adjusted current earnings would be 75 percent of $20, or  $15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Taxpayers subject to adjustment for adjusted current earnings.  The adjustment for adjusted current earnings applies to any corporation  other than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An S corporation as defined in section 1361,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A regulated investment company as defined in section 851,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A real estate investment trust as defined in section 856, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A real estate mortgage investment conduit as defined in section  860A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> General rule for applying Internal Revenue Code provisions in  determining adjusted current earnings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided by regulations or other guidance issued by the  Internal Revenue Service, all Internal Revenue Code provisions that  apply in determining the regular taxable income of a taxpayer also apply  in determining adjusted current earnings. For example, the rules of part  V of subchapter P (relating to original issue discount and similar  matters) of the Code apply in determining the amount (and the timing) of  any interest income included in adjusted current earnings under this  section. In applying Code provisions, however, the adjustments of  section 56(g) and this section are also taken into account. For example,  in applying the capitalization provisions of section 263A, the amount of  depreciation to be capitalized is based on the amount of depreciation  allowed in computing adjusted current earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (a)(5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corporation N is a calendar year manufacturer of golf clubs. N  places new manufacturing equipment in service in 1990. The regular tax  depreciation allowable for this equipment is $80,000; the pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income depreciation is $60,000; and the  adjusted current earnings depreciation is $40,000. All of the golf clubs  N produces in 1990 are unsold and are in ending inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to section 263A and Sec.  1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(I), N must  capitalize the depreciation allowed for the year for the new  manufacturing equipment in the ending inventory of golf clubs. Thus,  when N sells the golf clubs (or is deemed to have sold them under its  normal method of accounting), the cost of goods sold attributable to the  capitalized depreciation will be $80,000 in computing regular taxable  income; $60,000 in computing pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income; and $40,000 in computing adjusted current earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Definitions. The following terms have the following meanings for  purpose of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income. Pre- adjustment alternative minimum taxable income is the alternative minimum  taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, determined under  section 55(b)(2), but without the adjustment for adjusted current  earnings under section 56(g) and this section, without the alternative  tax net operating loss deduction under section 56(a)(4), and without the  alternative tax energy preference deduction under section 56(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusted current earnings. Adjusted current earnings is the  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income of the taxpayer for  the taxable year, adjusted as provided in section 56(g) and this  section. To the extent an amount is included (or deducted) in computing  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income for the taxable year  (whether because an adjustment is made under section 56 or 58, because  of a tax preference item under section 57, or because the item is  reflected in taxable income), that amount is not again included (or  deducted) in computing adjusted current earnings for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Earnings and profits. Earnings and profits means current  earnings and profits within the meaning of section 316(a)(2), that is,  earnings and profits for the taxable year computed as of the close of  the taxable year of the corporation without diminution by reason of any  distributions made during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Application to foreign corporations. See paragraph (m) of this  section for rules relating to the application of this section to foreign  corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>. Generally, the rules for computing the adjusted  current earnings depreciation deduction differ depending on the taxable  year in which the property is placed in service and the method used in  computing the depreciation deduction for taxable income purposes. See  Sec.  1.168(i)-1(k) for an election to use general asset accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  through (f)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> does not apply  to property described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to  certain property described in sections 168 (f)(1) through (f)(4)) or to  property described in paragraph (b)(5)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section (relating to  certain churning transactions described in section 168(f)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for computing the depreciation deduction. The  depreciation deduction for property described in this paragraph (b)(2)  is the amount determined by using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The adjusted basis of the property as determined in computing  alternative minimum taxable income as of the close of the last taxable  year beginning before January 1, 1990,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The straight-line method, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The recovery period that consists of the remainder of the  recovery period applicable to the property under the alternative  depreciation system of section 168(g).    Thus, the recovery period begins on the first day of the first taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1989, and ends on the last day of the  recovery period that would have applied had the recovery period for the  property originally been determined under section 168(g). In determining  the recovery period that would have applied, the property is deemed  placed in service on the date it was considered placed in service under  the depreciation convention that would have applied to the property  under section 168(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation X, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and  places in service on August 1, 1987, computer-based telephone central  office switching equipment. This is the only item of depreciable  property X places in service during 1987. Thus, the applicable  convention under section 168(d) is the half-year convention. As of  December 31, 1989, the adjusted basis of the property used in computing  alternative minimum taxable income is $42,000. The recovery period that  would have applied to the property under section 168(g)(2) is 9.5 years  (from July 1, 1987 to December 31, 1996). Thus, the recovery period for  computing adjusted current earnings under section 56(g)(4)(A)(ii) and  this paragraph (b)(2) begins on January 1, 1990, and ends on December  31, 1996. X's 1990 depreciation deduction for computing adjusted current  earnings is $6,000, determined under the straight-line method by  dividing $42,000 (adjusted basis) by 7 (recovery period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> does not apply to property described in paragraph  (b)(4) or (b)(5)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section (relating to certain section 168(f)  property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for computing the depreciation deduction. The  depreciation deduction for property described in this paragraph (b)(3)  is the amount determined by using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The adjusted basis of the property as determined in computing  taxable income as of the close of the last taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1990,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The straight-line method, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The recovery period that consists of the remainder of the  recovery period applicable to the property under the alternative  depreciation system of section 168(g).

In determining the recovery period  that would have applied, the property is deemed placed in service on the  date it was considered placed in service under the depreciation  convention that would have applied to the property under section 168(d)  (without regard to section 168(d)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation Y, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and  places in service on December 1, 1986, computer-based telephone central  office switching equipment. The depreciation convention that would have  applied to this property under section 168(d) (without regard to section  168(d)(3)) is the half-year convention. As of December 31, 1989, the  adjusted basis of the property used in computing taxable income is  $21,000. The recovery period for the property under section 168(g)(2) is  9.5 years (from July 1, 1986 to December 31, 1995). Thus, the recovery  period for computing adjusted current earnings under section  56(g)(4)(A)(iii) and this paragraph (b)(3) begins on January 1, 1990,  and ends on December 31, 1995. Y's 1990 depreciation deduction for  computing adjusted current earnings is $3,500, determined under the  straight-line method by dividing $21,000 (adjusted basis) by 6 (recovery  period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> is determined in the same manner as used in   computing taxable income, without regard to when the property is placed  in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> applies to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of new ACRS, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property placed in service before January 1, 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> does  not require the income on the contract to be included in adjusted  current earnings, however, because the income will be taken into account  in the taxable year the contract is completed and therefore is  considered to be taken into account in determining pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain amounts not taken into account in determining whether an  item is permanently excluded. The fact that proceeds from an income item  may eventually be reflected in pre-adjustment alternative minimum  taxable income of another taxpayer on the liquidation or disposal of a  business, or similar circumstances, is not taken into account in  determining whether the item is permanently excluded from pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income. Thus, for example, a corporation's  adjusted current earnings include interest excluded from pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income under section 103 even though the  interest might eventually be reflected in the pre-adjustment alternative  minimum taxable income of a corporate shareholder as gain on the  liquidation of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> are taken into  account using the taxpayer's method of accounting and are subject to any  provisions or limitations of the Code that would have applied if the  amounts had been deductible in determining pre-adjustment alternative  minimum taxable income. For example, section 267(a)(2) may affect the  timing of a deduction otherwise disallowed under section 265(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules. Adjusted current earnings does not include the  following amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income from the discharge of indebtedness. Amounts that are  excluded from gross income under section 108 of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986 or any corresponding provision of prior law (including the  Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, case law, income tax regulations and  administrative pronouncements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Federal income tax refunds. Refunds of federal income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Income earned on behalf of states and municipalities. Amounts  that are excluded from gross income under section 115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of life insurance contracts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This  paragraph (c)(5) addresses the treatment of life insurance contracts in  determining adjusted current earnings. These rules apply to life  insurance contracts as defined in section 7702. Generally, death  benefits under a life insurance contract are included in adjusted  current earnings, and all other distributions (including surrenders) are  taxed in accordance with the principles of section 72(e), taking into  account the taxpayer's basis in the contract for purposes of adjusted  current earnings. If the adjusted basis in the contract for purposes of  adjusted current earnings exceeds the amount of death benefits received  or the amount received when the contract is surrendered (increased by  the amount of any outstanding policy loan), the resulting loss is  allowed as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section in  computing adjusted current earnings for the taxable year. In addition,  undistributed income on the contract is included in adjusted current  earnings as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. Paragraph  (c)(5)(vi)(A) of this section provides special rules for term insurance  that has no net surrender value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.  The manner in which the income on the contract is determined for  adjusted current earnings purposes is prescribed in paragraph  (c)(5)(iii) of this section. If the income on the contract determined  under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section is a negative amount, income  on the contract is not included in adjusted current earnings and no  deduction from adjusted current earnings is allowed for the negative  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Calculation of income on the contract. For purposes of  determining adjusted current earnings, the income on a life insurance  contract for any period, including a taxable year, is the excess, if  any, of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The sum of the contract's net surrender value (as defined in  section 7702(f)(2)(B)) at the end of the period, and any distributions  under the contract during the period that, in accordance with the  principles of section 72(e), are not taxed because they represent  recoveries of the taxpayer's basis in the contract for adjusted current  earnings, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the contract's net surrender value at the end of the  preceding period, and any premiums paid under the contract during the  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of distributions under the life insurance contract.  Any distribution under a life insurance contract (whether a partial  withdrawal or an amount received on complete surrender of the contract)  is included in adjusted current earnings in accordance with the  principles of section 72(e), taking into account the taxpayer's basis in  the contract for purposes of computing   adjusted current earnings. The taxpayer's basis in the contract is equal  to the basis at the end of the immediately preceding period plus any  premiums paid before the distribution. The taxpayer's basis in the  contract for purposes of adjusted current earnings is reduced, in  accordance with the principles of section 72(e), to the extent that the  distribution is not included in adjusted current earnings because it  represents a recovery of that basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Treatment of death benefits. The excess of the contractual death  benefit of a life insurance contract over the taxpayer's adjusted basis  in the contract for purposes of computing adjusted current earnings at  the time of the insured's death is included in adjusted current earnings  as provided by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section. The amount of the  death benefit that is taken into account for adjusted current earnings  includes the amount of any outstanding policy loan treated as forgiven  or discharged by the insurance company upon the death of the insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Term life insurance contract without net  surrender values. Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(5)(vi), the  requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section do not apply to term  life insurance contracts that provide no net surrender value. Adjusted  current earnings are reduced by any premiums paid under such a contract  that are allocable to the taxable year. Any premiums paid that are not  allocable to the taxable year must be included in the basis of the  contract. The death benefit under such a term insurance contract is  included in adjusted current earnings as provided by paragraph (c)(5)(v)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Life insurance contracts involving divided ownership. If the  ownership of a life insurance contract is divided between different  persons (for example, a split-dollar arrangement), the requirements of  paragraph (c)(5) of this section apply to the separate ownership  interests as though each interest were a separate contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1987, corporation X, a calendar year  taxpayer, purchased a flexible premium life insurance contract with a  death benefit of $100,000 and planned annual gross premiums of $2,200  payable on January 1 of each year. The net surrender value of the  contract at the end of 1987 and subsequent years, together with the  cumulative premiums for the contract at the end of each year, are set  forth in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year-end</p><p class="depth0">Cumulative      net</p><p class="depth0">Year                         premiums    surrender</p><p class="depth0">paid        value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1987..........................................       $2,200       $2,420 1988..........................................        4,400        5,082 1989..........................................        6,600        8,010 1990..........................................        8,800       11,231 1991..........................................       11,000       14,774 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. The income under  the contract attributable to taxable years prior to 1990 does not  increase X's adjusted basis in the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For 1991, the income on the contract included in adjusted  current earnings is determined in the same manner as the preceding year,  and there is a corresponding increase in X's adjusted basis in the  contract. Thus, for 1991, the income on the contract is $1,343, which is  determined by subtracting from the net surrender value of the contract  at the end of the taxable year ($14,774) the sum of the net surrender  value at the end of the preceding taxable year ($11,231) plus the  premiums paid during the taxable year ($2,200). At the end of 1991, X's  adjusted basis in the contract for adjusted current earnings is $13,364,  which reflects the basis of the contract at the beginning of 1991,  increased by the premium paid during the year ($2,200) and the income on  the contract that has been included in adjusted current earnings for the  taxable year ($1,343).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that,  after the payment of the premium for 1991, the insured dies and X  receives the $100,000 death benefit under the contract. Under paragraph  (c)(5)(ii) of this section, no amount is included in adjusted current  earnings for income on the contract for the taxable year in which the  insured dies. Instead, under paragraph (c)(5)(v) of this section, X must  include the adjusted current earnings for 1991 the excess of the   death benefit ($100,000) over the adjusted basis in the contract for  purposes of computing adjusted current earnings at the time of the  insured's death ($12,021), which equals X's adjusted basis in the  contract at the end of 1990 ($9,821), increased by X's premium payment  for 1991 ($2,200).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1, except that  in addition to making the $2,200 planned premium payment for 1992, X  receives a $16,200 distribution under the contract on February 1, 1992,  leaving a net surrender value of $915 immediately following the  distribution. On March 1, 1992, X pays an additional premium of $5,000  under the contract. The net surrender value of the contract at the end  of 1992 is $6,417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of the distribution. Under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of  this section, the $16,200 distribution in 1992 is included in adjusted  current earnings as an amount taxable in accordance with the principles  of section 72(e) to the extent that the distribution ($16,200) exceeds  X's adjusted basis for adjusted current earnings, as determined at the  end of the immediately preceding period, and including premiums paid  through the period ending on the date of the distribution ($15,564).  Thus, X must include $636 in adjusted current earnings for 1992 as an  amount taxable in accordance with the principles of section 72(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, for 1992, the income on the contract must  be separately determined for the period beginning with the first day of  the taxable year to the date of the distribution and for the period  beginning immediately after the distribution to the end of the taxable  year, using the contract's net surrender values at the beginning and end  of each of these periods. The income on the contract for the period  beginning on January 1, 1992 and ending on February 1, 1992 (the date of  the distribution) is equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the sum of the  net surrender value at the end of the period ($915) and the amount of  the distribution that is allocable to X's basis in the contract for  adjusted current earnings ($15,564), over (B) the sum of the net  surrender value at the end of the preceding taxable year ($14,774) plus  any premiums paid on the contract during the period ($2,200). Because  the net result of this computation is a negative amount (($915+$15,564)- ($14,774+$2,200)=-495), no income on the contract for the period ending  with the date of the distribution is included in adjusted current  earnings for 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (c)(5)(ii), X must also determine the income on  the contract for the period beginning immediately after the distribution  through the end of the taxable year. The income on the contract for this  period is $502, which is equal to the excess of the net surrender value  at the end of the taxable year ($6,417) over the sum of the net  surrender value at the end of the preceding period ($915), plus any  premiums paid during the period ($5,000). At the end of 1992, X's  adjusted basis in the contract for adjusted current earnings is $5,502,  determined by adding the income on the contract ($502) and the premiums  paid during the period ($5,000) to the basis at the end of the preceding  period ($0).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Thus, X must include a total of $1,138 ($636+502) in adjusted  current earnings for 1992. This inclusion reflects both the  undistributed income on the contract for the taxable year plus the  amount of income from distributions under the contract that is taxed in  accordance with the principles of section 72(e) using X's adjusted basis  in the contract for adjusted current earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Partial list of income items excluded from gross income but  included in earnings and profits.

The Commissioner  may identify additional items described in paragraph (c)(1) in other  published guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Partial list of items excluded from both pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income and adjusted current earnings. The  following is a partial list of items that are excluded from both pre- adjustment alternative minimum taxable income and adjusted current  earnings, and for which no adjustment is allowed under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The value of improvements made by a lessee to a lessor's  property that is excluded from the lessor's income under section 109.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> contributions to the capital of a corporation by a non- shareholder that are excluded from the corporation's income under  section 118.  The Commissioner may identify additional items described in this  paragraph (c)(7) in other published guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disallowance of items not deductible in computing earnings and  profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph  (d), no deduction is allowed in computing adjusted current earnings for  any items that are not taken into account in determining earnings and  profits for any taxable year, even if the items are taken into account  in determining pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income. These  items therefore increase adjusted current earnings to the extent they  are deducted in computing pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income. An item of deduction is considered taken into account without  regard to the timing of its deductibility in computing earnings and  profits. Thus, to the extent an item is, has been, or will be deducted  for purposes of determining earnings and profits, it does not increase  adjusted current earnings in the taxable year in which it is deducted  for purposes of determining pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income. For example, a deduction allowed (in determining pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income) under section 196 for unused  research credits allowable under section 41 is taken into account in  computing earnings and profits because the costs that gave rise to the  credit were deductible in computing earnings and profits when incurred.  Therefore, the deduction does not increase adjusted current earnings. As  a further example, payments by a United States parent corporation with  respect to employees of certain foreign subsidiaries, which are  deductible under section 176, are considered contributions to the  capital of the foreign subsidiary for purposes of computing earnings and  profits. Although the payments are not deductible in computing the  earnings and profits of the United States parent corporation in the year  incurred, the payments do increase the parent's basis in its stock in  the foreign subsidiary. This basis increase will reduce any gain the  parent may later realize for purposes of computing earnings and profits  on the disposition of the stock of the foreign subsidiary. Therefore,  the amount of the payment by the parent is considered taken into account  in computing the earnings and profits of the parent and does not  increase adjusted current earnings. Thus, only deduction items that are  never taken into account in computing earnings and profits are  disallowed in computing adjusted current earnings under this paragraph  (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deductions for certain dividends received--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain amounts  deducted under sections 243 and 245. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section  does not apply to, and adjusted current earnings therefore are not  increased by, amounts deducted under sections 243 and 245 that qualify  as 100-percent deductible dividends under sections 243(a), 245(b) or  245(c), or to any dividend received from a 20-percent owned corporation  (as defined in section 243(c)(2)), to the extent that the dividend  giving rise to the deductions is attributable to earnings of the paying  corporation that are subject to federal income tax. Earnings are  considered subject to federal income   tax return (that is filed or, if not, that should be filed) of an entity  subject to United States taxation, even if there is no resulting United  States tax liability (e.g., because of net operating losses or tax  credits, other than the credit provided for in section 936).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dividends received from a foreign sales  corporation. The portion of a dividend received from a foreign sales  corporation (FSC) that is classified as a 100-percent deductible  dividend attributable to earnings of the FSC subject to federal income  tax is that portion of the dividend distributed out of earnings and  profits of the FSC attributable to non-exempt foreign trade income  determined under either of the administrative pricing methods of section  925(a) (1) or (2), and to non-exempt foreign trade income determined  under section 925(a)(3) that is effectively connected with the conduct  of a trade or business in the United States (determined without regard  to section 921). If the FSC is a 20-percent owned corporation (as  defined in section 243(c)(2)), an additional portion of that dividend is  classified as being attributable to earnings of the FSC subject to  federal income tax to the extent that the dividend is distributed out of  earnings and profits of the FSC attributable to effectively connected  income (as defined in section 245(c)(4)(B)). A FSC is defined in section  922 and, for purposes of this paragraph, includes a small FSC and a  former FSC. The ordering rules for distributions from a FSC set forth in  Sec.  1.926(a)-1T(b)(1) apply to determine the classification of  earnings and profits out of which a distribution has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dividends received from a section 936 corporation. For example,  assume that a section 936 corporation earns $100 of income in its  current taxable year, $10 of which is not eligible for the credit under  section 936. If the section 936 corporation makes a distribution of $50  during that year, $5 of that distribution ($10 of income not eligible  for the section 936 credit divided by $100 of income, times $50  distributed) is deemed to be attributable to earnings of the paying  corporation that are subject to federal income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for certain dividends received by certain  cooperatives.

Adjusted current earnings includes any income item that is included in  pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable income, even if that income  item is not included in earnings and profits for the taxable year.  Except as specifically provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(5) of this  section, no deduction is allowed for an item in computing adjusted  current earnings if the item is not deductible in computing pre- adjustment alternative minimum taxable income for the taxable year, even  if the item is deductible in computing earnings and profits for the  year.

To the extent inventory is treated  as produced or acquired during taxable years beginning after December  31, 1989, the inventory amount is determined with the adjustments  described in sections 56 and 58 and the items of tax preference  described in section 57. Thus, for example, the amount of depreciation  to be capitalized under section 263A with respect to inventory produced  in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989, is based on the  depreciation allowed under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.

X's LIFO recapture amount is $300 as of December 31,  1992, and is $200 as of December 31, 1993. Immediately prior to  calculating its LIFO recapture amount as of December 31, 1993, X   transfers inventory with an adjusted current earnings (ACE) basis of  $500 to Y Corporation in an exchange to which section 351 applies. X  determines that the $100 decrease in its LIFO recapture amount occurred  as a result of its transfer of inventories to Y in the section 351  exchange. Thus, under paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, X cannot  decrease its adjusted current earnings by that amount. In computing its  1994 LIFO recapture adjustment, X will use $200 as its LIFO recapture  amount as of December 31, 1993, even though it was not entitled to  reduce adjusted current earnings by the $100 decrease in its LIFO  recapture amount in 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of computing its ACE, Y takes a $500 carryover  basis in the inventories received from X. If Y, a newly formed calendar- year taxpayer, engages in no other inventory transactions in 1993 and  adopts the LIFO inventory method on its 1993 tax return, it will have a  LIFO recapture amount of $0 as of December 31, 1993 (because its FIFO  inventory amount and its LIFO inventory amount are both $500). Assume  that at December 31, 1994, Y has a LIFO recapture amount of $200 ($1,000  FIFO inventory amount-$800 LIFO inventory amount). Under paragraph  (f)(3)(i) of this section, Y computes a LIFO recapture adjustment for  1994 of $200 ($200-$0). If any portion of Y's $200 LIFO recapture  adjustment occurs solely by reason of its carryover basis in the  inventories it received from X, Y reduces its $200 LIFO recapture  adjustment by that portion under paragraph (f)(3)(iv). In any event,  however, Y will use its $200 LIFO recapture amount as of December 31,  1994, in computing its 1995 LIFO recapture adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Effective date.

Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this  section does not apply to any disposition in a taxable year beginning  before January 1, 1990, that is taken into account under the installment  method for purposes of computing pre-adjustment alternative minimum  taxable income. Thus, for any disposition in a taxable year beginning  before January 1, 1990, the installment method applies in computing  adjusted current earnings for taxable years beginning after December 31,  1989, to the same extent it applies in determining pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules for obligations to which section 453A applies-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The following special rules apply to any installment  sale occurring in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, that  results in an installment obligation to which section 453A(a)(1) applies  and with respect to which preadjustment alternative minimum taxable  income is determined under the installment method. As explained in  paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, for purposes of computing  adjusted current earnings, a portion of the contract price is eligible  for the installment method, and the remainder of the contract price is  not eligible for the installment method. Payments under the obligation  are allocated pro-rata between the two accounting methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitation on application of installment method. Only a portion  of the contract price of an installment sale described in paragraph  (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section is eligible to be accounted for under the  installment method for purposes of computing adjusted current earnings.  The portion eligible for the installment method is equal to the total  contract price of the sale multiplied by the applicable percentage (as  determined under section 453A(c)(4)) for the taxable year of the sale.  The remainder of the contract price is not eligible to be accounted for  under the installment method for purposes of computing adjusted current  earnings. The gross profit ratio is determined without regard to this  bifurcated treatment of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of the ineligible portion.

The installment obligation calls for 4 annual  payments of $5 million on January 1 of 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994.

See section 453A(c)(4). The portion of the contract price eligible  for accounting under the installment method for purposes of computing  adjusted current earnings is $18.75 million, or $25 million total  contract price times applicable percentage of 75 percent. The portion of  the contract price ineligible for the installment method is $6.25  million, or $25 million less $18.75 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In computing adjusted current earnings for 1990, A must include  $3.75 million of the gain on the sale.

[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Policy acquisition expenses of life insurance companies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. This paragraph (h) addresses the treatment of policy  acquisition expenses of life insurance companies in determining adjusted  current earnings. Policy acquisition expenses are those expenses that,  under generally accepted accounting principles in effect at the time the  expenses are incurred, are considered to vary with and to be primarily  related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies.  Generally, these acquisition expenses must be capitalized and amortized  for purposes of adjusted current earnings over the reasonably estimated  life of the acquired policy, using a method that provides a reasonable  allowance for amortization. This method of amortization is treated as if  it applied to all taxable years in determining the amount of policy  acquisition expenses deducted for adjusted current earnings. The rules  in this paragraph (h) apply to any life insurance company, as defined in  section 816(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonably estimated life. The reasonably estimated life of an  acquired policy is determined based on the facts with respect to each  policy (such as the age, sex, and health of the insured), and the  company's experience (such as mortality, lapse rate and renewals) with  similar policies. A company may treat as the reasonably estimated life   of an acquired policy the period for amortizing expenses of the acquired  policy that would be required by the Financial Accounting Standards  Board (FASB) at the time the acquisition expenses are incurred. If the  FASB has not established such a period, the period for amortizing  acquisition expense of an acquired policy under guidelines issued by the  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in effect at the time  the acquisition expenses are incurred may be treated as the reasonably  estimated life of the acquired policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable allowance for amortization. For purposes of  determining a reasonable allowance for amortization, a company may use a  method that amortizes acquisition expenses in the same proportion that  gross premiums and gross investment income for the taxable year bear to  total anticipated receipts of gross premiums (including anticipated  renewal premiums) and gross investment income to be realized over the  reasonably estimated life of the policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Safe harbor for public financial statements. Any company that is  required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a  financial statement with respect to the taxable year will be treated as  having complied with paragraph (h)(1) of this section if it accounts for  acquisition expenses for adjusted current earnings purposes in the same  manner as it accounts for those expenses on its financial statements  filed with the SEC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Depletion.

A corporation has an ownership  change for purposes of section 56(g)(4)(G)(i) and this paragraph (k) if  there is an ownership change under section 382(g) for purposes of  computing the corporation's amount of taxable income that may be offset  by pre-change losses or the regular tax liability that may be offset by  pre-change credits. See Sec.  1.382-2T for rules to determine whether a  corporation has an ownership change. Accordingly, in order for an  ownership change to occur for purposes of this paragraph (k), a  corporation must be a loss corporation as defined in Sec.  1.382- 2(a)(1). In determining whether the corporation is a loss corporation,  the determination of whether there is a net unrealized built-in loss is  made by using the aggregate adjusted basis of the assets of the  corporation used in computing taxable income. The aggregate adjusted  basis of the corporation's assets for purposes of computing adjusted  current earnings is not relevant in determining whether the corporation  is a loss corporation.

The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (q).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Example 1. K corporation distributes property with a fair market  value of $150 and an adjusted basis of $100. The adjusted basis is the  same for purposes of computing taxable income, pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income, adjusted current earnings, and  earnings and profits. Under section 312(a)(3), as modified by section  312(b)(2), K decreases its earnings and profits by the fair market value  of the property, or $150. Under section 312(b)(1), K increases its  earnings and profits by the excess of the fair market value of the  property over its adjusted basis, or $50. As a result of the  distribution, there is a net decrease in K's earnings and profits of  $100. K recognizes $50 of gain under section 311(b) as a result of the  distribution as if K sold the property for $150. K thus has no amount  permanently excluded from pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income that is taken into account in determining current earnings and  profits, and thus has no adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that  the distribution shareholder assumes a $190 liability in connection with  the disribution. Under section 312(c)(1), K must adjust the adjustments  to its earnings and profits under section 312 (a) and (b) to account for  the liability the shareholder assumes. K adjusts the $100 net decrease  in its earnings and profits to reflect the $190 liability, resulting in  an increase in its earnings and profits of $90. Because section  311(b)(2) makes the rules of section 336(b) apply, the fair market value  of the property is not less than the amount of the liability, or $190. K  therefore is treated as if it sold the   property for $190, recognizing $90 of gain. K thus has no amount  permanently excluded from pre-adjustment alternative minimum taxable  income that is taken into account in determining current earnings and  profits, and thus has no adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Elections to use simplified inventory methods to compute  alternative minimum tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

It is the  taxpayer's responsibility to timely modify its pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income and adjusted current earnings for  each year other than the year of change, either by furnishing the amount  of the adjustment to the revenue agent or by filing amended returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section, as well as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The caption ``Election to use regular tax inventories for AMT  purposes;''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the nature and amount of all items that would  result in adjustments and that the taxpayer would have reported if the  taxpayer had used the method described in this paragraph (r) for all  prior taxable years for which the period of limitations under section  6501(a) has not expired and which begin after December 31, 1986; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following declaration signed by the person authorized to  sign the return for the taxpayer: ``Under penalties of perjury, I  declare that I have examined this written statement, and to the best of  my knowledge and belief this written statement is true, correct, and  complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Year of change. The year of change is the earliest taxable year  for which the period of limitations under section 6501(a) has not  expired at the time the statement is submitted to the appropriate  revenue agent and that begins after December 31, 1986. Thus, the  adjustments required to be included on the statement must include any  adjustment under section 481(a) determined as if the method described in  this paragraph (r) had been used in all taxable years prior to the year  of change that begin after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Treatment of additional tax liability. Any additional tax  liability that results from the adjustments identified in the written  statement described in paragraph (r)(3)(iii)(B) of this section is  treated as an additional amount of tax shown on an amended return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election as method of accounting. The elections provided in  paragraphs (r)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section constitute either  adoptions of, or changes in, methods of accounting. These elections,  once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner   in accordance with the rules of section 446(e) and Sec.  1.446-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Untimely election to use simplified inventory method. If a  taxpayer makes an election described in this paragraph (r) after the  times set forth in paragraph (r)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section, the  taxpayer must comply with the requirements of Sec.  1.446-1(e)(3) in  order to secure the consent of the Commissioner to change to the method  of accounting prescribed in this paragraph (r). The taxpayer generally  will be subject to terms and conditions designed to place the taxpayer  in a position no more favorable than a taxpayer that timely complied  with paragraph (r)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, whichever is  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (r).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation L is a calendar year manufacturer of  baseball bats and uses the LIFO method of accounting for inventories.  During 1987, 1988, and 1989, L's cost of goods sold in computing taxable  income was as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1987         1988         1989 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Beginning LIFO inventory.........      $3,000       $4,000       $5,000 Purchases and other costs........       9,000        9,000        9,000 Ending LIFO inventory............

L's sole adjustment in computing alternative minimum tax during  1987, 1988, and 1989 was the depreciation adjustment under section  56(a)(1). Depreciation determined for both production and non-production  assets under section 168 and under section 56(a)(1) during 1987, 1988,  and 1989 was as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1987         1988         1989 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Section 168 depreciation.........      $1,800       $1,800       $1,800 Section 56(a)(1) depreciation....

For  1987, 1988, and 1989, L computed alternative minimum tax by deducting  the cost of goods sold which was reflected in taxable income ($8,000) in  accordance with paragraph (r)(2)(i) of this section. For 1987, 1988, and  1989, L also modified its adjustments under sections 56 and 58 and its  preferences under section 57 to disregard the portion of any adjustment  or preference that was capitalized in inventory. Thus, under section  56(a)(1), L increased alternative minimum taxable income during each  year by $900.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> L is eligible to make the election under paragraph (r)(1) of  this section in accordance with paragraph (r)(3)(i) of this section (a  prospective election).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> L must compute its LIFO recapture adjustment for each year by  reference to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The FIFO inventory amount after applying the provisions of  section 263A but before applying the adjustments of sections 56 and 58  and the items of preference in section 57; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The LIFO inventory amount used in computing taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> to use the inventory amounts used to compute pre-adjustment  alternative minimum taxable income in computing its adjusted current  earnings.

For purposes of computing adjusted current earnings, any  taxpayer claiming a deduction under section 56(h) must properly decrease  basis by the   portion of the deduction allowed under section 56(h) which is  attributable to adjustments under section 56(g)(4). In taxable years  following the taxable year in which the section 56(h) deduction is  claimed, basis recovery (including amortization, depletion, and gain on  sale) must properly take into account this basis reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (s):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer, incurs $100 of  intangible drilling costs on January 1, 1994 and as a result of these  intangible drilling costs A claims a deduction under section 56(h) of  $40. Assume that $20 of A's deduction under section 56(h) is  attributable to the adjustment under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. A  must reduce by $20 the amount of intangible drilling costs to be  amortized under paragraph (f)(1) of this section in 1995 through 1998  (the balance of the 60-month amortization period).
