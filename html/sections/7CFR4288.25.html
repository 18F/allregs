                            <p class="depth0">Any party obtaining a biorefinery that is participating in this  program must request permission to participate in this program as a  successor. The Agency may grant such request if it is determined that,  the party is eligible, and permitting such succession would serve the  purposes of the program. If appropriate, the Agency will require the  consent of the previous party to such succession. Also, the Agency may  terminate payments and demand full refund of payments made if a party  loses control of a biorefinery whose production of heat or power from  renewable biomass is the basis of a program payment, or otherwise fails  to retain the ability to assure that all program obligations and  requirements will be met.</p>
