                            <p class="depth0">The following experimental conditions apply for any solvent:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Temperature and pressure. Conduct the validation study and perform decontamination at room temperature (from =15 [deg]C to <=30 [deg]C) and at atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agitation. Limit the movement in the solvent to the short-term movement from placing the contaminated surface into the soak solvent and from removing the surface from the soak solvent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time of soak. Soak the surface for a minimum of 1 hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Surface conditions for the validation study. Prior to beginning the validation study, ensure that there are no free-flowing liquids on surfaces and that surfaces are dry (i.e., there are no liquids visible without magnification). Also ensure that surfaces are virtually free from non-liquid residues, corrosion, and other defects which would prevent the solvent from freely circulating over the surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Confirmatory sampling for the validation study. Select surface sample locations using representative sampling or a census. Sample a minimum area of 100 cm\2\ on each individual surface in the validation study. Measure surface concentrations using the standard wipe test, as defined in Sec. 761.123, from which a standard wipe sample is generated for chemical analysis. Guidance for wipe sampling appears in the document entitled ``Wipe Sampling and Double Wash/Rinse Cleanup as Recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,'' available on EPA's Web site at http://www.epa.gov/pcb, or from the Program Management, Communications, and Analysis Office, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5305P), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Concentration of PCBs. The method validated may be used only to decontaminate surfaces containing PCBs at concentrations on which the validation study was performed and lower concentrations.
