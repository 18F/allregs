                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. The statutory authority for adopting this part is section 11(p) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1821(p). Section 11(p) was added to the FDI Act by section 20 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (Pub. L. 103-204, 107 Stat. 2369 (1993)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this part is to prohibit individuals or entities who profited or engaged in wrongdoing at the expense of an insured institution, or seriously mismanaged an insured institution, from buying assets of failed financial institutions from the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. The restrictions of this part generally apply to assets of failed institutions owned or controlled by the FDIC in any capacity, even though the assets are not owned by the insured institution that the prospective purchaser injured. Unless we determine otherwise, this part does not apply to the sale of securities in connection with the investment of corporate and receivership funds pursuant to the Investment Policy for Liquidation Funds managed by the FDIC as it is in effect from time to time. In the case of a sale

of securities backed by a pool of assets that may include assets of failed institutions by a trust or other entity, this part applies only to the sale of assets by the FDIC to an underwriter in an initial offering, and not to any other purchaser of the securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The FDIC retains the authority to establish other policies restricting asset sales. Neither section 11(p) of the FDI Act nor this part in any way limits the authority of the FDIC to establish policies prohibiting the sale of assets to prospective purchasers who have injured any failed financial institution, or to other prospective purchasers, such as certain employees or contractors of the FDIC, or individuals who are not in compliance with the terms of any debt or duty owed to the FDIC. Any such policies may be independent of, in conjunction with, or in addition to the restrictions set forth in this part.</p>
