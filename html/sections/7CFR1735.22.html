See 7 CFR 1735.18 and 7 CFR 1735.51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS generally requires that borrowers provide it with a first  lien on all of the borrower's property.

See 7 CFR 1737.30 and 1737.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> RUS makes loans only if the borrower's entire system, including  the facilities to be constructed with the proceeds of the loan, is  economically feasible, as determined by RUS. In addition, RUS considers  a system to be feasible only if the system, in addition to being  feasible in all other respects, is year 2000 compliant or if the  borrower provides RUS with a certification, satisfactory to RUS, that  the system will be year 2000 compliant at a reasonable time before  December 31, 1999. Year 2000 compliant means that product performance  and function are not affected by dates before, during, and after the  year 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> of this section to the borrower  regardless of the provisions of the borrower's existing mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For Loans approved after December 22, 2008, the borrower shall  be required to maintain a TIER, at the end of the Forecast Period, at  least equal to the projected TIER determined by the feasibility study  prepared in connection with the loan, which shall be at least 1.0 and  not greater than 1.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Nothing in this section shall affect any rights of supplemental  lenders under the RUS mortgage, or other creditors of the borrower, to  limit a borrower's TIER requirement to a level above that established in  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A borrower will not be required to raise its TIER as a condition  for receiving a loan.
