The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or has not paid the debt by the payment due date, the FCA intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The name and address of the FCA official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other information, as may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, prior to, during, or after completion of the demand cycle, the FCA determines to collect the debt by either administrative or salary offset, the FCA shall follow, as applicable, the requirements for a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset set forth in Sec. 608.822.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If no response to the initial demand for payment is received by the payment due date, the FCA shall take further action under this part, under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, under the joint regulations (4 CFR parts 101-105), or under any other applicable State or Federal law. These actions may include reports to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of contracts, debarment, and salary or administrative offset.</p>
