                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The employee is entitled to receive all medical services,  appliances or supplies which a qualified physician prescribes or  recommends and which OWCP considers necessary to treat the work-related  injury. Billing for these services is described in subpart I of this  part. The employee need not be disabled to receive such treatment. If  there is any doubt as to whether a specific service, appliance or supply  is necessary to treat the work-related injury, the employee should  consult   OWCP prior to obtaining it through the automated authorization process  described in Sec. 10.800. OWCP may also utilize the services of a field  nurse to facilitate and coordinate medical care for the employee. OWCP  may contract with a specific provider or providers to supply such  services or appliances, including durable medical equipment and  prescribed medications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any qualified physician or qualified hospital may provide such  services, appliances and supplies. Non-physician providers such as  physicians' assistants, nurse practitioners and physical therapists may  also provide authorized services for injured employees to the extent  allowed by applicable Federal and State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where OWCP has not contracted for the provision of appliances or  supplies, only a supplier of durable medical equipment that is  registered in Medicare's Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics,  Orthotics and Supplies Accreditation process may furnish such appliances  and supplies. OWCP may apply a test of cost-effectiveness to appliances  and supplies, may offset the cost of prior rental payments against a  future purchase price, and may provide refurbished appliances where  appropriate.</p>
