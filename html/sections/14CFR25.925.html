                            <p class="depth0">Unless smaller clearances are substantiated, propeller clearances with the airplane at maximum weight, with the most adverse center of gravity, and with the propeller in the most adverse pitch position, may not be less than the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ground clearance. There must be a clearance of at least seven inches (for each airplane with nose wheel landing gear) or nine inches (for each airplane with tail wheel landing gear) between each propeller and the ground with the landing gear statically deflected and in the level takeoff, or taxiing attitude, whichever is most critical. In addition, there must be positive clearance between the propeller and the ground when in the level takeoff attitude with the critical tire(s) completely deflated and the corresponding landing gear strut bottomed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Water clearance. There must be a clearance of at least 18 inches between each propeller and the water, unless compliance with Sec. 25.239(a) can be shown with a lesser clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Structural clearance. There must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one inch radial clearance between the blade tips and the airplane structure, plus any additional radial clearance necessary to prevent harmful vibration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least one-half inch longitudinal clearance between the propeller blades or cuffs and stationary parts of the airplane; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Positive clearance between other rotating parts of the propeller or spinner and stationary parts of the airplane.
