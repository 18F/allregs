                                Sec. 1.460-1  Long-term contracts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section provides rules for  determining whether a contract for the manufacture, building,  installation, or construction of property is a long-term contract under  section 460 and what activities must be accounted for as a single long- term contract. Specific rules for long-term manufacturing and  construction contracts are provided in Secs. 1.460-2 and 1.460-3,  respectively. A taxpayer generally must determine the income from a  long-term contract using the percentage-of-completion method described  in Sec. 1.460-4(b) (PCM) and the cost allocation rules described in  Sec. 1.460-5(b) or (c). In addition, after a contract subject to the PCM  is completed, a taxpayer generally must apply the look-back method  described in Sec. 1.460-6 to determine the amount of interest owed on  any hypothetical underpayment of tax, or earned on any hypothetical  overpayment of tax, attributable to accounting for the long-term  contract under the PCM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions to required use of PCM--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempt construction  contract. The requirement to use the PCM does not apply to any exempt  construction contract described in Sec. 1.460-3(b). Thus, a taxpayer may  determine the income from an exempt construction contract using any  accounting method permitted by Sec. 1.460-4(c) and, for contracts  accounted for using the completed-contract method (CCM), any cost  allocation method permitted by Sec. 1.460-5(d). Exempt construction  contracts that are not subject to the PCM or CCM are not subject to the  cost allocation rules of Sec. 1.460-5 except for the production-period  interest rules of Sec. 1.460-5(b)(2)(v). Exempt construction contractors  that are large homebuilders described in Sec. 1.460-5(d)(3) must  capitalize costs under section 263A. All other exempt construction  contractors must account for the cost of construction using the  appropriate rules contained in other   sections of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified ship or residential construction contract. The  requirement to use the PCM applies only to a portion of a qualified ship  contract described in Sec. 1.460-2(d) or residential construction  contract described in Sec. 1.460-3(c). A taxpayer generally may  determine the income from a qualified ship contract or residential  construction contract using the percentage-of-completion/capitalized- cost method (PCCM) described in Sec. 1.460-4(e), but must use a cost  allocation method described in Sec. 1.460-5(b) for the entire contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Long-term contract. A long-term contract generally is  any contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or  construction of property if the contract is not completed within the  contracting year, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.  However, a contract for the manufacture of property is a long-term  contract only if it also satisfies either the unique item or 12-month  requirements described in Sec. 1.460-2. A contract for the manufacture  of personal property is a manufacturing contract. In contrast, a  contract for the building, installation, or construction of real  property is a construction contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or  construction of property--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A contract is a contract for  the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property if  the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property is  necessary for the taxpayer's contractual obligations to be fulfilled and  if the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of that  property has not been completed when the parties enter into the  contract. If a taxpayer has to manufacture or construct an item to  fulfill its obligations under the contract, the fact that the taxpayer  is not required to deliver that item to the customer is not relevant.  Whether the customer has title to, control over, or bears the risk of  loss from, the property manufactured or constructed by the taxpayer also  is not relevant. Furthermore, how the parties characterize their  agreement (e.g., as a contract for the sale of property) is not  relevant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, the allocable contract costs attributable to  the taxpayer's construction activities do not include the cost of the  land provided to the customer. In addition, a contract's estimated total  allocable contract costs include a proportionate share of the estimated  cost of any common improvement that benefits the subject matter of the  contract if the taxpayer is contractually obligated, or required by law,  to construct the common improvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocable contract costs. Allocable contract costs are costs  that are allocable to a long-term contract under Sec. 1.460-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Related party. A related party is a person whose relationship to  a taxpayer is described in section 707(b) or 267(b), determined without  regard to section 267(f)(1)(A) and determined by replacing ``at least 80  percent'' with ``more than 50 percent'' for the purposes of determining  the ownership of the stock of a corporation in sections 267(b)(2), (8),  (10)(A), and (12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contracting year. The contracting year is the taxable year in  which a taxpayer enters into a contract as described in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Completion year. The completion year is the taxable year in  which a taxpayer completes a contract as described in paragraph (c)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Contract commencement date. The contract commencement date is  the date that a taxpayer or related party first incurs any allocable  contract costs, such as design and engineering costs, other than  expenses attributable to bidding and negotiating activities. Generally,  the contract commencement date is relevant in applying   Sec. 1.460-6(b)(3) (concerning the de minimis exception to the look-back  method under section 460(b)(3)(B)); Sec. 1.460-5(b)(2)(v)(B)(1)(i)  (concerning the production period subject to interest allocation);  Sec. 1.460-2(d) (concerning qualified ship contracts); and Sec. 1.460- 3(b)(1)(ii) (concerning the construction period for exempt construction  contracts).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Incurred. Incurred has the meaning given in Sec. 1.461-1(a)(2)  (concerning the taxable year a liability is incurred under the accrual  method of accounting), regardless of a taxpayer's overall method of  accounting. See Sec. 1.461-4(d)(2)(ii) for economic performance rules  concerning the PCM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Independent research and development expenses. Independent  research and development expenses are any expenses incurred in the  performance of research or development, except that this term does not  include any expenses that are directly attributable to a particular  long-term contract in existence when the expenses are incurred and this  term does not include any expenses under an agreement to perform  research or development.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Long-term contract methods of accounting. Long-term contract  methods of accounting, which include the PCM, the CCM, the PCCM, and the  exempt-contract percentage-of-completion method (EPCM), are methods of  accounting that may be used only for long-term contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Entering into and completing long-term contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. To determine when a contract is entered into under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section and completed under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section, a taxpayer must consider all relevant allocable contract costs  incurred and activities performed by itself, by related parties on its  behalf, and by the customer, that are incident to or necessary for the  long-term contract. In addition, to determine whether a contract is  completed in the contracting year, the taxpayer may not consider when it  expects to complete the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date contract entered into--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer enters  into a contract on the date that the contract binds both the taxpayer  and the customer under applicable law, even if the contract is subject  to unsatisfied conditions not within the taxpayer's control (such as  obtaining financing). If a taxpayer delays entering into a contract for  a principal purpose of avoiding section 460, however, the taxpayer will  be treated as having entered into a contract not later than the contract  commencement date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Options and change orders. A taxpayer enters into a new  contract on the date that the customer exercises an option or similar  provision in a contract if that option or similar provision must be  severed from the contract under paragraph (e) of this section.  Similarly, a taxpayer enters into a new contract on the date that it  accepts a change order or other similar agreement if the change order or  other similar agreement must be severed from the contract under  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date contract completed--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer's contract  is completed upon the earlier of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Use of the subject matter of the contract by the customer for  its intended purpose (other than for testing) and at least 95 percent of  the total allocable contract costs attributable to the subject matter  have been incurred by the taxpayer; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Final completion and acceptance of the subject matter of the  contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Secondary items. The date a contract accounted for using the  CCM is completed is determined without regard to whether one or more  secondary items have been used or finally completed and accepted. If any  secondary items are incomplete at the end of the taxable year in which  the primary subject matter of a contract is completed, the taxpayer must  separate the portion of the gross contract price and the allocable  contract costs attributable to the incomplete secondary item(s) from the  completed contract and account for them using a permissible method of  accounting. A permissible method of accounting includes a long-term  contract method of accounting only if a separate contract for the  secondary item(s) would be a long-term contract, as defined in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subcontracts. In the case of a subcontract, a subcontractor's  customer is   the general contractor. Thus, the subject matter of the subcontract is  the relevant subject matter under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Final completion and acceptance--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), to determine whether  final completion and acceptance of the subject matter of a contract have  occurred, a taxpayer must consider all relevant facts and circumstances.  Nevertheless, a taxpayer may not delay the completion of a contract for  the principal purpose of deferring federal income tax.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Contingent compensation. Final completion and acceptance is  determined without regard to any contractual term that provides for  additional compensation that is contingent on the successful performance  of the subject matter of the contract. A taxpayer must account for all  contingent compensation that is not includible in total contract price  under Sec. 1.460-4(b)(4)(i), or in gross contract price under  Sec. 1.460-4(d)(3), using a permissible method of accounting. For  application of the look-back method for contracts accounted for using  the PCM, see Sec. 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) and (2)(vi).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Assembly or installation. Final completion and acceptance is  determined without regard to whether the taxpayer has an obligation to  assist or supervise assembly or installation of the subject matter of  the contract where the assembly or installation is not performed by the  taxpayer or a related party. A taxpayer must account for the gross  receipts and costs attributable to such an obligation using a  permissible method of accounting, other than a long-term contract  method.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Disputes. Final completion and acceptance is determined without  regard to whether a dispute exists at the time the taxpayer tenders the  subject matter of the contract to the customer. For contracts accounted  for using the CCM, see Sec. 1.460-4(d)(4). For application of the look- back method for contracts accounted for using the PCM, see Sec. 1.460- 6(c)(1)(ii) and (2)(vi).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation among activities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Long-term contract  methods of accounting apply only to the gross receipts and costs  attributable to long-term contract activities. Gross receipts and costs  attributable to long-term contract activities means amounts included in  total contract price or gross contract price, whichever is applicable,  as determined under Sec. 1.460-4, and costs allocable to the contract,  as determined under Sec. 1.460-5. Gross receipts and costs attributable  to non-long-term contract activities (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of  this section) generally must be taken into account using a permissible  method of accounting other than a long-term contract method. See section  446(c) and Sec. 1.446-1(c). However, if the performance of a non-long- term contract activity is incident to or necessary for the manufacture,  building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of one or  more of the taxpayer's long-term contracts, the gross receipts and costs  attributable to that activity must be allocated to the long-term  contract(s) benefitted as provided in Secs. 1.460-4(b)(4)(i) and 1.460- 5(f)(2), respectively. Similarly, if a single long-term contract  requires a taxpayer to perform a non-long-term contract activity that is  not incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building,  installation, or construction of the subject matter of the long-term  contract, the gross receipts and costs attributable to that non-long- term contract activity must be separated from the contract and accounted  for using a permissible method of accounting other than a long-term  contract method. But see paragraph (g) of this section for related party  rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-long-term contract activity. Non-long-term contract activity  means the performance of an activity other than manufacturing, building,  installation, or construction, such as the provision of architectural,  design, engineering, and construction management services, and the  development or implementation of computer software. In addition,  performance under a guaranty, warranty, or maintenance agreement is a  non-long-term contract activity that is never incident to or necessary  for the manufacture or construction of property under a long-term  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Severing and aggregating contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. After  application of the allocation rules of paragraph (d)   of this section, the severing and aggregating rules of this paragraph  (e) may be applied by the Commissioner or the taxpayer as necessary to  clearly reflect income (e.g., to prevent the unreasonable deferral (or  acceleration) of income or the premature recognition (or deferral) of  loss). Under the severing and aggregating rules, one agreement may be  treated as two or more contracts, and two or more agreements may be  treated as one contract. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of  this section, a taxpayer must determine whether to sever an agreement or  to aggregate two or more agreements based on the facts and circumstances  known at the end of the contracting year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facts and circumstances. Whether an agreement should be severed,  or two or more agreements should be aggregated, depends on the following  factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pricing. Independent pricing of items in an agreement is  necessary for the agreement to be severed into two or more contracts. In  the case of an agreement for similar items, if the price to be paid for  the items is determined under different terms or formulas (e.g., if some  items are priced under a cost-plus incentive fee arrangement and later  items are to be priced under a fixed-price arrangement), then the  difference in the pricing terms or formulas indicates that the items are  independently priced. Similarly, interdependent pricing of items in  separate agreements is necessary for two or more agreements to be  aggregated into one contract. A single price negotiation for similar  items ordered under one or more agreements indicates that the items are  interdependently priced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Separate delivery or acceptance. An agreement may not be  severed into two or more contracts unless it provides for separate  delivery or separate acceptance of items that are the subject matter of  the agreement. However, the separate delivery or separate acceptance of  items by itself does not necessarily require an agreement to be severed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>, a taxpayer's expectation that the parties would enter into  another agreement, when agreeing to the terms contained in the first  agreement, is not relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Severance for PCM. A taxpayer may not sever  under this paragraph (e) a long-term contract that would be subject to  the PCM without obtaining the Commissioner's prior written consent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Options and change orders. Except as provided in paragraph  (e)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer must sever an agreement that  increases the number of units to be supplied to the customer, such as  through the exercise of an option or the acceptance of a change order,  if the agreement provides for separate delivery or separate acceptance  of the additional units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Statement with return. If a taxpayer severs an agreement or  aggregates two or more agreements under this paragraph (e) during the  taxable year, the taxpayer must attach a statement to its original  federal income tax return for that year. This statement must contain the  following information--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The legend NOTIFICATION OF SEVERANCE OR AGGREGATION UNDER SEC.  1.460-1(e);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's name; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer's employer identification number or social  security number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Classifying contracts--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. After applying the  severing and aggregating rules of paragraph (e) of this section, a  taxpayer must determine the classification of a contract (e.g., as a  long-term manufacturing contract, long-term construction contract, non-   long-term contract) based on all the facts and circumstances known no  later than the end of the contracting year. Classification is determined  on a contract-by-contract basis. Consequently, a requirement to  manufacture a single unique item under a long-term contract will subject  all other items in that contract to section 460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hybrid contracts--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A long-term contract that  requires a taxpayer to perform both manufacturing and construction  activities (hybrid contract) generally must be classified as two  contracts, a manufacturing contract and a construction contract. A  taxpayer may elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to classify a  hybrid contract as a long-term construction contract if at least 95  percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs are reasonably  allocable to construction activities. In addition, a taxpayer may elect,  on a contract-by-contract basis, to classify a hybrid contract as a  long-term manufacturing contract subject to the PCM.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Elections. A taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph  (f)(2) by using its method of accounting for similar construction  contracts or for manufacturing contracts, whichever is applicable, to  account for a hybrid contract entered into during the taxable year of  the election on its original federal income tax return for the election  year. If an electing taxpayer's method is the PCM, the taxpayer also  must use the PCM to apply the look-back method under Sec. 1.460-6 and to  determine alternative minimum taxable income under Sec. 1.460-4(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Method of accounting. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)  of this section, a taxpayer's method of classifying contracts is a  method of accounting under section 446 and, thus, may not be changed  without the Commissioner's consent. If a taxpayer's method of  classifying contracts is unreasonable, that classification method is an  impermissible accounting method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of estimates--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Estimating length of contract. A taxpayer  must use a reasonable estimate of the time required to complete a  contract when necessary to classify the contract (e.g., to determine  whether the five-year completion rule for qualified ship contracts under  Sec. 1.460-2(d), or the two-year completion rule for exempt construction  contracts under Sec. 1.460-3(b), is satisfied, but not to determine  whether a contract is completed within the contracting year under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section). To be considered reasonable, an  estimate of the time required to complete the contract must include  anticipated time for delay, rework, change orders, technology or design  problems, or other problems that reasonably can be anticipated  considering the nature of the contract and prior experience. A contract  term that specifies an expected completion or delivery date may be  considered evidence that the taxpayer reasonably expects to complete or  deliver the subject matter of the contract on or about the date  specified, especially if the contract provides bona fide penalties for  failing to meet the specified date. If a taxpayer classifies a contract  based on a reasonable estimate of completion time, the contract will not  be reclassified based on the actual (or another reasonable estimate of)  completion time. A taxpayer's estimate of completion time will not be  considered unreasonable if a contract is not completed within the  estimated time primarily because of unforeseeable factors not within the  taxpayer's control, such as third-party litigation, extreme weather  conditions, strikes, or delays in securing permits or licenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estimating allocable contract costs. A taxpayer must use a  reasonable estimate of total allocable contract costs when necessary to  classify the contract (e.g., to determine whether a contract is a home  construction contract under Sec. 1.460-(3)(b)(2)). If a taxpayer  classifies a contract based on a reasonable estimate of total allocable  contract costs, the contract will not be reclassified based on the  actual (or another reasonable estimate of) total allocable contract  costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rules for activities benefitting long-term contracts of  a related party--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Related party use of PCM--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, if a related party and  its customer enter into a long-term contract subject to the   PCM, and a taxpayer performs any activity that is incident to or  necessary for the related party's long-term contract, the taxpayer must  account for the gross receipts and costs attributable to this activity  using the PCM, even if this activity is not otherwise subject to section  460(a). This type of activity may include, for example, the performance  of engineering and design services, and the production of components and  subassemblies that are reasonably expected to be used in the production  of the subject matter of the related party's contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for components and subassemblies. A taxpayer is not  required to use the PCM under this paragraph (g) to account for a  component or subassembly that benefits a related party's long-term  contract if more than 50 percent of the average annual gross receipts  attributable to the sale of this item for the 3-taxable-year-period  ending with the contracting year comes from unrelated parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total contract price. If a taxpayer is required to use the PCM  under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the total contract price (as  defined in Sec. 1.460-4(b)(4)(i)) is the fair market value of the  taxpayer's activity that is incident to or necessary for the performance  of the related party's long-term contract. The related party also must  use the fair market value of the taxpayer's activity as the cost it  incurs for the activity. The fair market value of the taxpayer's  activity may or may not be the same as the amount the related party pays  the taxpayer for that activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Completion factor. To compute a contract's completion factor (as  described in Sec. 1.460-4(b)(5)), the related party must take into  account the fair market value of the taxpayer's activity that is  incident to or necessary for the performance of the related party's  long-term contract when the related party incurs the liability to the  taxpayer for the activity, rather than when the taxpayer incurs the  costs to perform the activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided,  this section and Secs. 1.460-2 through 1.460-5 are applicable for  contracts entered into on or after January 11, 2001.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this chapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Contract for manufacture of property. B notifies C, an  aircraft manufacturer, that it wants to purchase an aircraft of a  particular type. At the time C receives the order, C has on hand several  partially completed aircraft of this type; however, C does not have any  completed aircraft of this type on hand. C and B agree that B will  purchase one of these aircraft after it has been completed. C retains  title to and risk of loss with respect to the aircraft until the sale  takes place. The agreement between C and B is a contract for the  manufacture of property under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, even  if labeled as a contract for the sale of property, because the  manufacture of the aircraft is necessary for C's obligations under the   agreement to be fulfilled and the manufacturing was not complete when B  and C entered into the agreement.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. De minimis construction activity. C, a master developer  whose taxable year ends December 31, owns 5,000 acres of undeveloped  land with a cost basis of $5,000,000 and a fair market value of  $50,000,000. To obtain permission from the local county government to  improve this land, a service road must be constructed on this land to  benefit all 5,000 acres. In 2001, C enters into a contract to sell a  1,000-acre parcel of undeveloped land to B, a residential developer, for  its fair market value, $10,000,000. In this contract, C agrees to  construct a service road running through the land that C is selling to B  and through the 4,000 adjacent acres of undeveloped land that C has sold  or will sell to other residential developers for its fair market value,  $40,000,000. C reasonably estimates that it will incur allocable  contract costs of $50,000 (excluding the cost of the land) to construct  this service road, which will be owned and maintained by the county. C  must reasonably allocate the cost of the service road among the  benefitted parcels. The portion of the estimated total allocable  contract costs that C allocates to the 1,000-acre parcel being sold to B  (based upon its fair market value) is $10,000 ($50,000x($10,000,000/ $50,000,000)). Construction of the service road is finished in 2002.  Because the estimated total allocable contract costs attributable to C's  construction activities, $10,000, are less than 10 percent of the  contract's total contract price, $10,000,000, C's contract with B is not  a construction contract under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.  Thus, C's contract with B is not a long-term contract under paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section, notwithstanding that construction of the  service road is not completed in 2001.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Completion--customer use. In 2002, C, whose taxable year  ends December 31, enters into a contract to construct a building for B.  In November of 2003, the building is completed in every respect  necessary for its intended use, and B occupies the building. In early  December of 2003, B notifies C of some minor deficiencies that need to  be corrected, and C agrees to correct them in January 2004. C reasonably  estimates that the cost of correcting these deficiencies will be less  than five percent of the total allocable contract costs. C's contract is  complete under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section in 2003 because in  that year, B used the building and C had incurred at least 95 percent of  the total allocable contract costs attributable to the building. C must  use a permissible method of accounting for any deficiency-related costs  incurred after 2003.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Completion--customer use. In 2001, C, whose taxable year  ends December 31, agrees to construct a shopping center, which includes  an adjoining parking lot, for B. By October 2002, C has finished  constructing the retail portion of the shopping center. By December  2002, C has graded the entire parking lot, but has paved only one-fourth  of it because inclement weather conditions prevented C from laying  asphalt on the remaining three-fourths. In December 2002, B opens the  retail portion of the shopping center and the paved portion of the  parking lot to the general public. C reasonably estimates that the cost  of paving the remaining three-fourths of the parking lot when weather  permits will exceed five percent of C's total allocable contract costs.  Even though B is using the subject matter of the contract, C's contract  is not completed in December 2002 under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this  section because C has not incurred at least 95 percent of the total  allocable contract costs attributable to the subject matter.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Completion--customer use. In 2001, C, whose taxable year  ends December 31, agrees to manufacture 100 machines for B. By December  31, 2002, C has delivered 99 of the machines to B. C reasonably  estimates that the cost of finishing the related work on the contract  will be less than five percent of the total allocable contract costs.  C's contract is not complete under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this  section in 2002 because in that year, B is not using the subject matter  of the contract (all 100 machines) for its intended purpose.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Non-long-term contract activity. On January 1, 2001, C,  whose taxable year ends December 31, enters into a single long-term  contract to design and manufacture a satellite and to develop computer  software enabling B to operate the satellite. At the end of 2001, C has  not finished manufacturing the satellite. Designing the satellite and  developing the computer software are non-long-term contract activities  that are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's manufacturing of  the subject matter of a long-term contract because the satellite could  not be manufactured without the design and would not operate without the  software. Thus, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must allocate  these non-long-term contract activities to the long-term contract and  account for the gross receipts and costs attributable to designing the  satellite and developing computer software using the PCM.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Non-long-term contract activity. C agrees to manufacture  equipment for B under a long-term contract. In a separate contract, C  agrees to design the equipment being manufactured for B under the long- term contract. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must allocate  the gross receipts and costs related to the design to the long-term  contract because designing the equipment is a non-long-term contract  activity that is incident to and necessary for the   manufacture of the subject matter of the long-term contract.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Severance. On January 1, 2001, C, a construction  contractor, and B, a real estate investor, enter into an agreement  requiring C to build two office buildings in different areas of a large  city. The agreement provides that the two office buildings will be  completed by C and accepted by B in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and  that C will be paid $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 for the two office  buildings, respectively. The agreement will provide C with a reasonable  profit from the construction of each building. Unless C is required to  use the PCM to account for the contract, C is required to sever this  contract under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because the buildings  are independently priced, the agreement provides for separate delivery  and acceptance of the buildings, and, as each building will generate a  reasonable profit, a reasonable businessperson would have entered into  separate agreements for the terms agreed upon for each building.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. Severance. C, a large construction contractor whose  taxable year ends December 31, accounts for its construction contracts  using the PCM and has elected to use the 10-percent method described in  Sec. 1.460-4(b)(6). In September 2001, C enters into an agreement to  construct four buildings in four different cities. The buildings are  independently priced and the contract provides a reasonable profit for  each of the buildings. In addition, the agreement requires C to complete  one building per year in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. As of December 31,  2001, C has incurred 25 percent of the estimated total allocable  contract costs attributable to one of the buildings, but only five  percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs attributable to  all four buildings included in the agreement. C does not request the  Commissioner's consent to sever this contract. Using the 10-percent  method, C does not take into account any portion of the total contract  price or any incurred allocable contract costs attributable to this  agreement in 2001. Upon examination of C's 2001 tax return, the  Commissioner determines that C entered into one agreement for four  buildings rather than four separate agreements each for one building  solely to take advantage of the deferral obtained under the 10-percent  method. Consequently, to clearly reflect the taxpayer's income, the  Commissioner may require C to sever the agreement into four separate  contracts under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because the buildings  are independently priced, the agreement provides for separate delivery  and acceptance of the buildings, and a reasonable businessperson would  have entered into separate agreements for these buildings.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Aggregation. In 2001, C, a shipbuilder, enters into two  agreements with the Department of the Navy as the result of a single  negotiation. Each agreement obligates C to manufacture a submarine.  Because the submarines are of the same class, their specifications are  similar. Because C has never manufactured submarines of this class,  however, C anticipates that it will incur substantially higher costs to  manufacture the first submarine, to be delivered in 2007, than to  manufacture the second submarine, to be delivered in 2010. If the  agreements are treated as separate contracts, the first contract  probably will produce a substantial loss, while the second contract  probably will produce substantial profit. Based upon these facts,  aggregation is required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because  the submarines are interdependently priced and a reasonable  businessperson would not have entered the first agreement without also  entering into the second.</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. Aggregation. In 2001, C, a manufacturer of aircraft and  related equipment, agrees to manufacture 10 military aircraft for  foreign government B and to deliver the aircraft by the end of 2003.  When entering into the agreement, C anticipates that it might receive  production orders from B over the next 20 years for as many as 300 more  of these aircraft. The negotiated contract price reflects C's and B's  consideration of the expected total cost of manufacturing the 10  aircraft, the risks and opportunities associated with the agreement, and  the additional factors the parties considered relevant. The negotiated  price provides a profit on the sale of the 10 aircraft even if C does  not receive any additional production orders from B. It is unlikely,  however, that C actually would have wanted to manufacture the 10  aircraft but for the expectation that it would receive additional  production orders from B. In 2003, B accepts delivery of the 10  aircraft. At that time, B orders an additional 20 aircraft of the same  type for delivery in 2007. When negotiating the price for the additional  20 aircraft, C and B consider the fact that the expected unit cost for  this production run of 20 aircraft will be lower than the unit cost of  the 10 aircraft completed and accepted in 2003, but substantially higher  than the expected unit cost of future production runs. Based upon these  facts, aggregation is not permitted under paragraph (e)(2) of this  section. Because the parties negotiated the prices of both agreements  considering only the expected production costs and risks for each  agreement standing alone, the terms and conditions agreed upon for the  first agreement are independent of the terms and conditions agreed upon  for the second agreement. The fact that the agreement to manufacture 10  aircraft provides a profit for C indicates that a reasonable  businessperson would have entered into that agreement without entering  into the agreement to manufacture the additional 20 aircraft.</p><p class="depth2">Example 12. Classification and completion. In 2001, C, whose taxable  year ends December 31, agrees to manufacture and install an industrial  machine for B. C elects under paragraph (f) of this section to classify  the agreement as a long-term manufacturing contract and to account for  it using the PCM. The agreement requires C to deliver the machine in  August 2003 and to install and test the machine in B's factory. In  addition, the agreement requires B to accept the machine when the tests  prove that the machine's performance will satisfy the environmental  standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), even if B  has not obtained the required operating permit. Because of technical  difficulties, C cannot deliver the machine until December 2003, when B  conditionally accepts delivery. C installs the machine in December 2003  and then tests it through February 2004. B accepts the machine in  February 2004, but does not obtain the operating permit from the EPA  until January 2005. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section, C's  contract is finally completed and accepted in February 2004, even though  B does not obtain the operating permit until January 2005, because C  completed all its obligations under the contract and B accepted the  machine in February 2004.
