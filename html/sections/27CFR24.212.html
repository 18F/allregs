                            <p class="depth0">High fermentation wine is wine made with the addition of sugar within the limitations prescribed for natural wine except that the alcohol content after complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening is more than 14 percent and wine spirits have not been added. Although high fermentation wine is not a standard wine, it is produced, stored, and handled on bonded wine premises subject to the same marking or labeling requirements.
