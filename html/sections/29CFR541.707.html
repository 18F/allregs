The following factors should be considered  in determining whether such work is exempt work: Whether the same work  is performed by any of the exempt employee's subordinates;  practicability of delegating the work to a nonexempt employee; whether  the exempt employee performs the task frequently or occasionally; and  existence of an industry practice for the exempt employee to perform the  task.</p>
