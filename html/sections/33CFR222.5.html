                                Sec. 222.5  Water control management (ER 1110-2-240).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This regulation prescribes policies and procedures to  be followed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in carrying out water  control management activities, including establishment of water control  plans for Corps and non-Corps projects, as required by Federal laws and  directives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This regulation is applicable to all field  operating activities having civil works responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> References. Appendix A lists U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  publications and sections of Federal statutes and regulations that are  referenced herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authorities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects.  Authorities for allocation of storage and regulation of projects owned  and operated by the   Corps of Engineers are contained in legislative authorization acts and  referenced project documents. These public laws and project documents  usually contain provisions for development of water control plans, and  appropriate revisions thereto, under the discretionary authority of the  Chief of Engineers. Some modifications in project operation are  permitted under congressional enactments subsequent to original project  authorization. Questions that require interpretations of authorizations  affecting regulation of specific reservoirs will be referred to CDR  USACE (DAEN-CWE-HW), WASH DC 20314, with appropriate background  information and analysis, for resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-Corps projects. The Corps of Engineers is responsible for  prescribing flood control and navigation regulations for certain  reservoir projects constructed or operated by other Federal, non-Federal  or private agencies. There are several classes of such projects: Those  authorized by special acts of Congress; those for which licenses issued  by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (formerly Federal Power  Commission) provide that operation shall be in accordance with  instructions of the Secretary of the Army; those covered by agreements  between the operating agency and the Corps of Engineers; and those that  fall under the terms of general legislative and administrative  provisions. These authorities, of illustrative examples, are described  briefly in Appendix B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Terminology: Water control plans and reservoir regulation  schedules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Water control plans include coordinated regulation  schedules for project/system regulation and such additional provisions  as may be required to collect, analyze and disseminate basic data,  prepare detailed operating instructions, assure project safety and carry  out regulation of projects in an appropriate manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``reservoir regulation schedule'' refers to a  compilation of operating criteria, guidelines, rule curves and  specifications that govern basically the storage and release functions  of a reservoir. In general, schedules indicate limiting rates of  reservoir releases required during various seasons of the year to meet  all functional objectives of the particular project, acting separately  or in combination with other projects in a system. Schedules are usually  expressed in the form of graphs and tabulations, supplemented by concise  specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> General policies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Water control plans will be developed for  reservoirs, locks and dams, reregulation and major control structures  and interrelated systems to comform with objectives and specific  provisions of authorizing legislation and applicable Corps of Engineers  reports. They will include any applicable authorities established after  project construction. The water control plans will be prepared giving  appropriate consideration to all applicable Congressional Acts relating  to operation of Federal facilities, i.e., Fish and Wildlife Coordination  Act (Pub. L. 85-624), Federal Water Project Recreation Act-Uniform  Policies (Pub. L. 89-72), National Environmental Policy Act of 1969  (Pub. L. 91-190), and Clean Water Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-217). Thorough  analysis and testing studies will be made as necessary to establish the  optimum water control plans possible within prevailing constraints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Necessary actions will be taken to keep approved water control  plans up-to-date. For this purpose, plans will be subject to continuing  and progressive study by personnel in field offices of the Corps of  Engineers. These personnel will be professionally qualified in technical  areas involved and familiar with comprehensive project objectives and  other factors affecting water control. Organizational requirements for  water control management are further discussed in ER 1110-2-1400.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Water control plans developed for specific projects and  reservoir systems will be clearly documented in appropriate water  control manuals. These manuals will be prepared to meet initial  requirements when storage in the reservoir begins. They will be revised  as necessary to conform with changing requirements resulting from  developments in the project area and downstream, improvements in  technology, new legislation and other relevant factors, provided such  revisions comply with existing Federal regulations and established Corps  of Engineers policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Development and execution of water control plans will include  appropriate consideration for efficient water management in conformance  with the emphasis on water conservation as a national priority. The  objectives of efficient water control management are to produce  beneficial water savings and improvements in the availability and  quality of water resulting from project regulation/operation. Balanced  resource use through improved regulation should be developed to conserve  as much water as possible and maximize all project functions consistent  with project/system management. Continuous examination should be made of  regulation schedules, possible need for storage reallocation (within  existing authority and constraints) and to identify needed changes in  normal regulation. Emphasis should be placed on evaluating conditions  that could require deviation from normal release schedules as part of  drought contingency plans (ER 1110-2-1941).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adequate provisions for collection, analysis and dissemination  of basic data, the formulation of specific project regulation  directives, and the performance of project regulation will be  established at field level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Appropriate provisions will be made for monitoring project  operations, formulating advisories to higher authorities, and  disseminating information to others concerned. These actions are  required to facilitate proper regulation of systems and to keep the  public fully informed regarding all pertinent water control matters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In development and execution of water control plans, appropriate  attention will be given to project safety in accordance with ER 1130-2- 417 and ER 1130-2-419 so as to insure that all water impounding  structures are operated for the safety of users of the facilities and  the general public. Care will be exercised in the development of  reservoir regulation schedules to assure that controlled releases  minimize project impacts and do not jeopardize the safety of persons  engaged in activities downstream of the facility. Water control plans  will include provisions for issuing adequate warnings or otherwise  alerting all affected interests to possible hazards from project  regulation activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In carrying out water control activities, Corps of Engineers  personnel must recognize and observe the legal responsibility of the  National Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), for issuing weather forecasts and flood warnings,  including river discharges and stages. River forecasts prepared by the  Corps of Engineers in the execution of its responsibilities should not  be released to the general public, unless the NWS is willing to make the  release or agrees to such dissemination. However, release to interested  parties of factual information on current storms or river conditions and  properly quoted NWS forecasts is permissible. District offices are  encouraged to provide assistance to communities and individuals  regarding the impact of forecasted floods. Typical advice would be to  provide approximate water surface elevations at locations upstream and  downstream of the NWS forecasting stream gages. Announcement of  anticipated changes in reservoir release rates as far in advance as  possible to the general public is the responsibility of Corps of  Engineers water control managers for projects under their jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Water control plans will be developed in concert with all basin  interests which are or could be impacted by or have an influence on  project regulation. Close coordination will be maintained with all  appropriate international, Federal, State, regional and local agencies  in the development and execution of water control plans. Effective  public information programs will be developed and maintained so as to  inform and educate the public regarding Corps of Engineers water control  management activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Fiscal year budget requests for water control management  activities will be prepared and submitted to the Office of the Chief of  Engineers in accordance with requirements established in Engineer  Circular on Annual Budget Requests for Civil Works Activities. The total  annual costs of all activities and facilities that support the water  control functions, (excluding physical operation of projects, but  including flood control and navigation   regulation of projects subject to 33 CFR 208.11) are to be reported.  Information on the Water Control Data Systems and associated  Communications Category of the Plant Replacement and Improvement Program  will be submitted with the annual budget. Reporting will be in  accordance with the annual Engineer Circular on Civil Works Operations  and Maintenance, General Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Responsibilities: US Army Corps of Engineers projects--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Preparation of water control plans and manuals. Normally, district  commanders are primarily responsible for background studies and for  developing plans and manuals required for reservoirs, locks and dams,  reregulation and major control structures and interrelated systems in  their respective district areas. Policies and general guidelines are  prescribed by OCE engineer regulations while specific requirements to  implement OCE guidance are established by the division commanders  concerned. Master Water Control Manuals for river basins that include  more than one district are usually prepared by or under direct  supervision of division representatives. Division commanders are  responsible for providing such management and technical assistance as  may be required to assure that plans and manuals are prepared on a  timely and adequate basis to meet water control requirements in the  division area, and for pertinent coordination among districts,  divisions, and other appropriate entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public involvement and information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Public meeting and  public involvement. The Corps of Engineers will sponsor public  involvement activities, as appropriate, to appraise the general public  of the water control plan. In developing or modifying water control  manuals, the following criteria is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Conditions that require public involvement and public meetings  include: Development of a new water control manual that includes a water  control plan; or revision or update of a water control manual that  changes the water control plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Revisions to water control manuals that are administratively or  informational in nature and that do not change the water control plan do  not require public meetings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For those conditions described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this  section, the Corps will provide information to the public concerning  proposed water control management decisions at least 30 days in advance  of a public meeting. In so doing, a separate document(s) should be  prepared that explains the recommended water control plan or change, and  provides technical information explaining the basis for the  recommendation. It should include a description of its impacts (both  monetary and nonmonetary) for various purposes, and the comparisons with  alternative plans or changes and their effects. The plan or manual will  be prepared only after the public involvement process associated with  its development or change is complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For those conditions described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this  section, the responsible division office will send each proposed water  control manual to the Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters, Attn: CECW- EH-W for review and comments prior to approval by the responsible  division office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Information availability. The water control manual will be made  available for examination by the general public upon request at the  appropriate office of the Corps of Engineers. Public notice shall be  given in the event of occurring or anticipated significant changes in  reservoir storage or flow releases. The method of conveying this  information shall be commensurate with the urgency of the situation and  the lead time available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Authority for approval of plans and manuals. Division commanders  are delegated authority for approval of water control plans and manuals,  and associated activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> OCE role in water control activities. OCE will establish  policies and guidelines applicable to all field offices and for such  actions as are necessary to assure a reasonable degree of consistency in  basic policies and practices in all Division areas. Assistance will be  provided to field offices during emergencies and upon special request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Methods improvement and staff training. Division and district  commanders are responsible for conducting   appropriate programs for improving technical methods applicable to water  control activities in their respective areas. Suitable training programs  should be maintained to assure a satisfactory performance capability in  water control activities. Appropriate coordination of such programs with  similar activities in other areas will be accomplished to avoid  duplication of effort, and to foster desirable exchange of ideas and  developments. Initiative in re-evaluating methods and guidelines  previously established in official documents referred to in paragraph  (e) of this section is encouraged where needs are evident. However,  proposals for major deviations from basic concepts, policies and general  practices reflected in official publications will be submitted to CDR  USACE (DAEN-CWE) WASH DC 20314 for concurrence or comment before being  adopted for substantial application in actual project regulation at  field level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Directives and technical instruction manuals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Directives  issued through OCE Engineer Regulations will be used to foster  consistency in policies and basic practices. They will be supplemented  as needed by other forms of communication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engineering Manuals (EM) and Engineer Technical Letters (ETL)  are issued by OCE to serve as general guidelines and technical aids in  developing water control plans and manuals for individual projects or  systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EM 1110-2-3600 discusses principles and concepts involved in  developing water control plans. Instructions relating to preparation of  ``Water Control Manuals for speicfic projects'' are included. EM 1110-2- 3600 should be used as a general guide to water control activities. The  instructions are sufficiently flexible to permit adaptation to specific  regions. Supplemental information regarding technical methods is  provided in numerous documents distributed to field offices as  ``hydrologic references.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special assistance in technical studies is available from the  Hydrologic Engineering Center, Corps of Engineers, 609 Second Street,  Davis, California 95616 and DAEN-CWE-HW.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water control manuals for US Army Corps of Engineers projects.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As used herein, the term ``water control manual'' refers to manuals  that relate primarily to the functional regulation of an individual  project or system of projects. Although such manuals normally include  background information concerning physical features of projects, they do  not prescribe rules or methods for physical maintenance or care of  facilities, which are covered in other documents. (References 15 and 23,  appendix A.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Water control manuals prepared in substantially the detail and  format specified in instructions referred to in paragraph 8 are required  for all reservoirs under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers,  regardless of the purpose or size of the project. Water Control manuals  are also required for lock and dam, reregulation and major control  structure projects that are physically regulated by the Corps of  Engineers. Where there are several projects in a drainage basin with  interrelated purposes, a ``Master Manual'' shall be prepared. The  effects of non-Corps projects will be considered in appropriate detail,  including an indication of provisions for interagency coordination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Preliminary water control manuals,'' for projects regulated by  the Corps of Engineers should contain regulation schedules in sufficient  detail to establish the basic plan of initial project regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As a general rule, preliminary manuals should be superseded by  more detailed interim or ``final'' manuals within approximately one year  after the project is placed in operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each water control manual will contain a section on special  regulations to be conducted during emergency situations, including  droughts. Preplanned operations and coordination are essential to  effective relief or assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> One copy of all water control manuals and subsequent revisions  shall be forwarded to DAEN-CWE-HW for file purposes as soon as  practicable after completion, preferably within 30 days from date of  approval at the division level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Policies and requirements for preparing regulations for non- Corps projects. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Division and district commanders   will develop water control plans as required by section 7 of the 1944  Flood Control Act, the Federal Power Act and section 9 of Pub. L. 436-83  for all projects located within their areas, in conformance with ER  1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208. That regulation prescribes the policy and  general procedures for regulating reservoir projects capable of  regulation for flood control or navigation, except projects owned and  operated by the Corps of Engineers; the International Boundary and Water  Commission, United States and Mexico; those under the jurisdiction of  the International Joint Commission, United States and Canada, and the  Columbia River Treaty. ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 permits the  promulgation of specific regulations for a project in compliance with  the authorizing acts, when agreement on acceptable regulations cannot be  reached between the Corps Engineers and the owners. Appendix B provides  a summary of the Corps of Engineers responsibilities for prescribing  regulations for non-Corps reservoir projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Water control plans will be developed and processed as soon as  possible for applicable projects already completed and being operated by  other entities, including projects built by the Corps of Engineers and  turned over to others for operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In so far as practicable, water control plans for non-Corps  projects should be developed in cooperation with owning/operating  agencies involved during project planning stages. Thus, tentative  agreements on contents, including pertinent regulation schedules and  diagrams, can be accomplished prior to completion of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The magnitude and nature of storage allocations for flood  control or navigation purposes in non-Corps projects are governed  basically by conditions of project authorizations or other legislative  provisions and may include any or all of the following types of storage  assignments:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Year-round allocations: Storage remains the same all year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Seasonal allocations: Storage varies on a fixed seasonal basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Variable allocations of flood control from year to year,  depending on hydrologic parameters, such as snow cover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Water control plans should be developed to attain maximum flood  control or navigation benefits, consistent with other project  requirements, from the storage space provided for these purposes. When  reservoir storage capacity of the category referred to in paragraph  (j)(4)(iii) is utilized for flood control or navigation, jointly with  other objectives, the hydrologic parameters and related rules developed  under provisions of ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 should conform as  equitably as possible with the multiple-purpose objectives established  in project authorizations and other pertinent legislation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Storage allocations made for flood control or navigation  purposes in non-Corps projects are not subject to modifications by the  Corps of Engineers as a prerequisite for prescribing 33 CFR 208.11  regulations. However, regulations developed for use of such storage  should be predicated on a mutual understanding between representatives  of the Corps and the operating agency concerning the conditions of the  allocations in order to assure reasonable achievement of basic  objectives intended. In the event field representatives of the Corps of  Engineers, and the operating agency are unable to reach necessary  agreements after all reasonable possibilities have been explored,  appropriate background explanations and recommendations should be  submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW for consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The Chief of Engineers is responsible for prescribing  regulations for use of flood control or navigation storage and/or  project operation under the provisions of the referenced legislative  acts. Accordingly, any regulations established should designate the  division/district commander who is responsible to the Chief of Engineers  as the representative to issue any special instructions required under  the regulation. However, to the extent practicable, project regulations  should be written to permit operation of the project by the owner  without interpretations of the regulations by the designated  representative of the Commander during operating periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Responsibility for compliance with 33 CFR 208.11 regulations  rests with the operating agency. The division or district commander of  the area in which the project is located will be kept informed regarding  project operations to verify reasonable conformance with the  regulations. The Chief of Engineers or his designated representative may  authorize or direct deviation from the established water control plan  when conditions warrant such deviation. In the event unapproved  deviations from the prescribed regulations seem evident, the division or  district commander concerned will bring the matter to the attention of  the operating agency by appropriate means.  If corrective actions are not taken promptly, the operating agency  should be notified of the apparent deviation in writing as a matter of  record. Should an impasse arise, in that the project owner or the  designated operating entity persists in noncompliance with regulations  prescribed by the Corps of Engineers, the Office of Chief Counsel should  be advised through normal channels and requested to take necessary  measures to assure compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Regulations should contain information regarding the required  exchange of basic data between the representative of the operating  agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that are pertinent to  regulation and coordination of interrelated projects in the region.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> All 33 CFR 208.11 regulations shall contain provisions  authorizing the operating agency to temporarily deviate from the  regulations in the event that it is necessary for emergency reasons to  protect the safety of the dam, to avoid health hazards, and to alleviate  other critical situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Developing and processing regulations for non-Corps projects.  Guidelines concerning technical studies and development of regulations  are contained in ER 1110-2-241, 33 CFR part 208 and EM 1110-2-3600.  Appendix C of this regulation summarizes steps normally followed in  developing and processing regulations for non-Corps projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Water control during project construction stage. Water control  plans discussed in preceding paragraphs are intended primarily for  application after the dam, spillway and outlet structures; major  relocations; land acquisitions, administrative arrangements and other  project requirements have reached stages that permit relatively normal  project regulation. With respect to non-Corps projects, regulations  normally become applicable when water control agreements have been  signed by the designated signatories, subject to special provisions in  specific cases. In some instances, implementation of regulations has  been delayed by legal provisions, contract limitations, or other  considerations. These delays can result in loss of potential project  benefits and possible hazards. Accordingly, it is essential that  appropriate water control and contingency plans be established for use  from the date any storage may accumulate behind a partially completed  dam until the project is formally accepted for normal operations.  Division commanders shall make certain that construction-stage  regulation plans are established and maintained in a timely and adequate  manner for projects under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers. In  addition, the problems referred to should be discussed with authorities  who are responsible for non-Corps projects, with the objective of  assuring that such projects operate as safely and effectively as  possible during the critical construction stage and any period that may  elapse before regular operating arrangements have been established.  These special regulation plans should include consideration for  protection of construction operations; safety of downstream interests  that might be jeopardized by failure of partially completed embankments;  requirements for minimizing adverse effects on partially completed  relocations or incomplete land acquisition; and the need for obtaining  benefits from project storage that can be safely achieved during the  construction and early operation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Advisories to OCE regarding water control activities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General. Division commanders will keep the Chief of Engineers currently  informed of any unusual problems or activities associated with water  control that impact on his responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual division water control management report (RCS DAEN-CWE- 16(R1)). Division commanders will submit an annual report on water  control management activities within their division. The annual report  will be submitted to (DAEN-CWE-HW) by 1 February each year and cover  significant activities of the previous water year and a description of  activities to be accomplished for the current year. Funding information  for water control activities will be provided in the letter of  transmittal for in-house use only. The primary objective of this summary  is to keep the Chief of Engineers informed regarding overall water  management activities Corps-wide, thus providing a basis to carry out  OCE responsibilities set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Status of water control manuals. A brief discussion shall be  prepared annually by each division commander, as a separate section of  the annual report on water control management activities discussed in  paragraph (m)(2) of this section listing all projects currently in  operation in his area, or expected to begin operation within one-year,  with a designation of the status of water control manuals. The report  should also list projects for which the Corps of Engineers is  responsible for prescribing regulations, as defined in ER 1110-2-241, 33  CFR part 208.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Monthly water control charts (RCS DAEN-CWE-6 (R1)). A monthly  record of reservoirs/lakes operated by the Corps of Engineers and other  agencies, in accordance with 33 CFR 208.11, will be promptly prepared  and maintained by district/division commanders in a form readily  available for transmittal to the Chief of Engineers, or others, upon  request. Record data may be prepared in either graphical form as shown  in EM 1110-2-3600, or tabular form as shown in the sample tabulation in  Appendix D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Annual division water quality reports (RCS DAEN-CWE-15). By  Executive Order 12088, the President ordered the head of each Executive  Agency to be responsible for ensuring that all necessary actions are  taken for prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution  with respect to Federal facilities and activities under control of the  agency. General guidance is provided in references 24 and 25, Appendix  A, for carrying out this agency's responsibility. Annual division water  quality reports are required by reference 24, Appendix A. The report is  submitted in two parts. The first part addresses the division Water  quality management plan while the second part presents specific project  information. A major objective of this report is to summarize  information pertinent to water quality aspects of overall water  management responsibilities. The annual division water quality report  may be submitted along with the annual report on water control  management activities discussed in paragraph 13b above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Master plans for water control data systems (RCS DAEN-CWE-21).  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A water control data system is all of the equipment within a  division which is used to acquire, process, display and distribute  information for real-time project regulation and associated interagency  coordination. A subsystem is all equipment as defined previously within  a district. A network is all equipment as defined previously which is  used to regulate a single project or a group of projects which must be  regulated interdependently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Master plans for water control data systems and significant  revisions thereto will be prepared by division water control managers  and submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW by 1 February each year for review and  approval of engineering aspects. Engineering approval does not  constitute funding approval. After engineering approval is obtained,  equipment in the master plan is eligible for consideration in the  funding processes described in ER 1125-2-301 and engineering circulars  on the annual budget request for civil works activities. Master plans  will be maintained current and will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Outline the system performance requirements, including those  resulting from any expected expansions of Corps missions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Describe the extent to which existing facilities fulfill  performance requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Describe alternative approaches which will upgrade the system to  meet   the requirements not fulfilled by existing facilities, or are more cost  effective then the existing system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Justify and recommend a system considering timeliness,  reliability, economics and other factors deemed important.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Delineate system scope, implementation schedules, proposed  annual capital expenditures by district, total costs, and sources of  funding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Modified master plans should be submitted to DAEN-CWE-HW by 1  February, whenever revisions are required, to include equipment not  previously approved or changes in scope or approach. Submittal by the  February date will allow adequate time for OCE review and approval prior  to annual budget submittals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Division commanders are delegated authority to approve detailed  plans for subsystems and networks of approved master plans. Plans  approved by the division commander should meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan conforms to an approved master plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The equipment is capable of functioning independently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An evaluation of alternatives has been completed considering  reliability, cost and other important factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The plan is economically justified, except in special cases  where legal requirements dictate performance standards which cannot be  economically justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Copies of plans approved by the division commander shall be  forwarded to appropriate elements in OCE in support of funding requests  and to obtain approval of Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE),  when applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Water control data systems may be funded from Plant Revolving  Fund; O&M; General; Flood Control, MR&T;, and Construction, General.  Funding for water control equipment that serves two or more projects  will be from Plant Revolving Fund in accordance with ER 1125-2-301.  District and division water control managers will coordinate plant  revolving fund requests with their respective Plant Replacement and  Improvement Program (PRIP) representatives following guidance provided  in ER 1125-2-301. Budget funding requests under the proper appropriation  title should be submitted only if the equipment is identified in an  approved master plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Justification for the Automatic Data Processing Equipment  (ADPE) aspects of water control data systems must conform to AR 18-1,  Appendix I or J as required.

Section 7 of Act of Congress approved 22 December 1944 (58 Stat.  890; 33 U.S.C. 709), reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0">``Hereafter, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War to  prescribe regulations for the use of storage allocated for flood control  or navigation at all reservoirs constructed wholly or in part with  Federal funds provided on the basis of such purposes, and the operation  of any such project shall be in accordance with such regulations:  Provided, That this section shall not apply to the Tennessee Valley  Authority, except that in case of danger from floods on the Lower Ohio  and Mississippi Rivers the Tennessee Valley Authority is directed to  regulate the release of water from the Tennessee River into the Ohio  River in accordance with such instructions as may be issued by the War  Department.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Section 9(b) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, approved 4  August 1939 (53 Stat. 1189, 43 U.S.C. 485), provides that the Secretary  of the Interior may allocate to flood control or navigation as part of  the cost of new projects or supplemental works; and that in connection  therewith he shall consult with the Chief of Engineers and may perform  any necessary investigations under a cooperative agreement with the  Secretary of the Army. These projects are subject to 33 CFR 208.11  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">4. Several dams have been constructed by State agencies under  provisions of legislative acts wherein the Secretary of the Army is  directed to prescribe rules and regulations for project operation in the  interest of flood control and navigation. These projects are subject to  33 CFR 208.11 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">5. There are few dams constructed under Emergency Conservation work  authority or similar programs, where the Corps of Engineers has  performed major repairs or rehabilitation, that are operated and  maintained by local agencies which are subject to 33 CFR 208.11  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">6. The Federal Power Act, approved 10 June 1920, as amended (41  Stat. 1063, 16 U.S.C. 791 (A)), established the Federal Power  Commission, now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), with  authority to issue licenses for constructing, operating, and maintaining  dams or other project works for the development of navigation, for  utilization of water power and for other beneficial public uses in any  streams over which Congress has jurisdiction. The Chief of Engineers is  called upon for advice and assistance as needed in formulating reservoir  regulation requirements somewhat as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. In response to requests from the FERC, opinions and technical  appraisals are furnished by the Corps of Engineers for consideration  prior to issuance of licenses by the FERC. Such assistance may be  limited to general presentations, or may include relatively detailed  proposals for water control plans, depending upon the nature and scope  of projects under consideration. The information furnished is subject to  such consideration and use as the Chairman, FERC, deems appropriate.  This may result in inclusion of simple provisions in licenses without  elaboration, or relatively detailed requirements for reservoir  regulation schedules and plans.</p><p class="depth0">b. Some special acts of Congress provide for construction of dams  and reservoirs by non-Federal agencies or private firms under licenses  issued by the FERC, subject to stipulation that the operation and  maintenance of the dams shall be subject to reasonable rules and  regulations of the Secretary of the Army in the interest of flood  control and navigation. Ordinarily no Federal funds are involved, thus  Section 7 of the 1944 Flood Control Act does not apply. However, if  issuance of regulations by the Secretary of the Army is required by the  authority under which flood control or navigation provisions are  included as functions of the specific project or otherwise specified in  the FERC license, regulation plans will be prescribed in accordance with  33 CFR 208.11 regulations.</p><p class="depth0">7. Projects constructed by the Corps of Engineers for local flood  protection purposes are subject to conditions of local cooperation as  provided in Section 3 of the Flood Control Act approved 22 June 1936, as  amended. One of those conditions is that a responsible local agency will  maintain and operate all works after completion in accordance with  regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army. Most such projects  consist mainly of levees and flood walls with appurtenant drainage  structures. Regulations for operation and maintenance of these projects  has been prescribed by the Secretary of the Army in 33 CFR 208.10. When  a reservoir is included in such a project, it may be appropriate to  apply 33 CFR 208.10 in establishing regulations for operation, without  requiring their publication in the Federal Register. For example, if the  reservoir controls a small drainage area, has an uncontrolled flood  control outlet with automatic operation or contains less than 12,500  acre-feet of flood control or navigation storage, 33 CFR 208.10 may be  suitable. However, 33 CFR 208.11 regulations normally would be  applicable in prescribing flood control regulations for the individual  reservoir, if the project has a gated flood control outlet by which the  local agency can regulate floods.</p><p class="depth0">8. Regulation plans for projects owned by the Corps of Engineers are  not prescribed in accordance with 33 CFR 208.11. However, regulation  plans for projects constructed by the Corps of Engineers and turned over  to other agencies or local interests for operation may be prescribed in  accordance with 33 CFR 208.11.</p><p class="depth0">9. The Small Reclamation Projects Act of 6 August 1956 provides that  the Secretary of the Interior may make loans or grants to local agencies  for the construction of reclamation projects. Section 5 of the Act  provides in part that the contract covering any such grant shall set  forth that operation be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the  head of the Federal department or agency primarily concerned. Normally,  33 CFR 208.11 is not applicable to these projects.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C to Sec. 222.5--Procedures for Developing and Processing</p><p class="depth0">Regulations for Non-Corps Projects in Conformance with 33 CFR 208.11</p><p class="depth0">1. Sequence of actions. a. Discussions leading to a clarification of  conditions governing allocations of storage capacity to flood control or  navigation purposes and project regulation are initiated by District/ Division Engineers through contacts with owners and/or operating  agencies concerned at regional level.</p><p class="depth0">b. Background information on the project and conditions requiring  flood control or navigation services, and other relevant factors, are  assembled by the District Engineer and incorporated in a ``Preliminary  Information Report''. The Preliminary Information Report will be  submitted to the Division Engineer for review and approval. Normally,  the agency having jurisdiction over the particular project is expected  to furnish information on project features, the basis for storage  allocations and any other available data pertinent to the studies. The  Corps of Engineers supplements this information as required.</p><p class="depth0">c. Studies required to develop reservoir regulation schedules and  plans usually will be conducted by Corps of Engineers personnel at  District level, except where the project regulation affects flows in  more than one district, in which case the studies will be conducted by  or under supervision of Division personnel. Assistance as may be  available from the project operating agency or others concerned will be  solicited.</p><p class="depth0">d. When necessary agreements are reached at district level, and  regulations developed in accordance with 33 CFR 208.11 and EM 1110-2- 3600, they will be submitted to the Division Commander for review and  approval, with information copies for DAEN-CWE-HW. Usually the  regulations include diagrams of operating parameters.</p><p class="depth0">e. For projects owned by the Bureau of Reclamation, the respective  Regional Directors are designated as duly authorized representatives of  the Commissioner of Reclamation. By letter of 20 October 1976, the  Commissioner delegated responsibilities to the Regional Directors as  follows: ``Regarding the designated authorization of representatives of  the Commissioner of Reclamation in matters relating to the development  and processing of Section 7 flood control regulations, we are  designating each Regional Director as our duly authorized representative  to sign all letters of understanding, water control agreements, water  control diagrams, water control release schedules and other documents  which may become part of the prescribed regulations. The Regional  Director also will be responsible for obtaining the signature of the  designated operating agency on these documents where such is required.  Regarding internal coordination within the Bureau of Reclamation, the  Regional Directors will obtain the review and approval of this office  and at appropriate offices with our Engineering and Research Center,  Denver, Colorado, prior to signing water control documents.''</p><p class="depth0">f. In accordance with the delegation cited in paragraph e, 33 CFR  208.11 regulations pertaining to Bureau of Reclamation projects will be  processed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After regulation documents submitted by District Commanders are  reviewed and approved by the Division Commander they are transmitted to  the respective Regional Director of the Bureau of Reclamation for  concurrence of comment, with a request that   tracings of regulation diagrams be signed and returned to the Division  Commander.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If any questions arise at this stage appropriate actions are  taken to resolve differences. Otherwise, the duplicate tracings of the  regulation diagram are signed by the Division Commander and transmitted  to the office of the project owner for filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After full agreement has been reached in steps (1) and (2), the  text of proposed regulations is prepared in final form. Copies of any  diagrams involved are included for information only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A letter announcing completion of action on processing the  regulations, with pertinent project data as specified in paragraph  208.11(d)(11) of 33 CFR 208.11, and one copy of the signed tracings of  diagrams are forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-CWE-HW) WASH DC 20314 for  promulgation and filing. The office of the Chief of Engineers will  forward the pertinent project data to the Liaison Officer with the  Federal Register, requesting publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">g. Regulations developed in accordance with 33 CFR 208.11 and  applicable to projects that are not under supervision of the Bureau of  Reclamation are processed in substantially the manner described above.  All coordination required between the Corps of Engineers and the  operating agency will be accomplished at field level.</p><p class="depth0">h. Upon completion of actions listed above, Division Commanders are  responsible for informing the operating agencies at field level that  regulations have been promulgated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Signature blocks: Some 33 CFR 208.11 regulations contain diagrams  of parameter curves that cannot be published in the Federal Register,  but are made a part thereof by appropriate reference. Each diagram bears  a title block with spaces for the signature of authenticating officials  of the Corps of Engineers and the owner/operating agency of the project  involved.</p><p class="depth0">3. Designation of Corps of Engineers Representatives. Division  Commanders are designated representatives of the Chief of Engineers in  matters relating to development and processing of 33 CFR 208.11  regulations for eventual promulgation through publication of selected  data specified in paragraph (d)(11) Sec. 208.11. Division Commanders are  designated as the Corps of Engineers signee on all letters of  understanding, water control agreements and other documents which may  become part of prescribed regulations for projects located in their  respective geographic areas, and which are subject to the provisions of  33 CFR 208.11.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D to Sec.  222.5--Sample Tabulation</p><p class="depth0">Bardwell Lake, Monthly Lake Report, May 1975 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Elevations 0800:   Storage    Evap     Pump    Release   Inflow    Rain,</p><p class="depth0">Day                    2,400 feet-MSL    2400 A-F    DSF     DSF       DSF    adj.
