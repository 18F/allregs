cost analysis or if the applicant requests such an analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant to Sec. Sec. 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and Sec. 455.64.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the purpose of ranking applications.</p>
