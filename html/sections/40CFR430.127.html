Appendix A to Part 430--Methods 1650 and 1653</p><p class="depth0">Method 1650--Adsorbable Organic Halides by Adsorption and Coulometric</p><p class="depth0">Titration</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method is for determination of adsorbable organic halides (AOX) associated with the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and other organic halides amenable to combustion and coulometric titration. The method is designed to meet the survey and monitoring requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The method is applicable to the determination of AOX in water and wastewater. This method is a combination of several existing methods for organic halide measurements (References 1 through 7).</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method can be used to measure organically-bound halides (chlorine, bromine, iodine) present in dissolved or suspended form. Results are reported as organic chloride (Cl-). The detection limit of the method is usually dependent on interferences rather than instrumental limitations. A method detection limit (MDL; Reference 8) of 6.6 g/L, and a minimum level (ML; Section 18) of 20 g/L, can be achieved with no interferences present.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 This method is for use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a combustion/micro-coulometer. Each laboratory that uses this method must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results using the procedures described in Section 9.2.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of the method beyond those expressly permitted (Section 9.1.2) is subject to application and approval of an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Sample preservation: Residual chlorine that may be present is removed by the addition of sodium thiosulfate. Samples are adjusted to a pH <2 and maintained at 0 to 4 [deg]C until analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Sample analysis: Organic halide in water is determined by adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC), washing the adsorbed sample and GAC to remove inorganic halide, combustion of the sample and GAC to form the hydrogen halide, and titration of the hydrogen halide with a micro-coulometer, as shown in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Micro-coulometer.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1 This detector operates by maintaining a constant silver-ion concentration in a titration cell. An electric potential is applied to a solid silver electrode to produce silver ions in the cell. As hydrogen halide produced from the combustion of organic halide enters the cell, it is partitioned into an acetic acid electrolyte where it precipitates as silver halide. The current produced is integrated over the combustion period. The electric charge is proportional to the number of moles of halogen captured in the cell (Reference 6).</p><p class="depth0">2.3.2 The mass concentration of organic halides is reported as an equivalent concentration of organically bound chloride (Cl-).</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Adsorbable organic halides is defined as the analyte measured by this method. The nature of the organo-halides and the presence of semi-extractable material will influence the amount measured and interpretation of results.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Definitions for terms used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method (Section 18).</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield elevated readings from the micro-coulometer. All materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of analysis by running method blanks initially and with each sample batch (samples started through the adsorption process in a given eight-hour shift, to a maximum of 20 samples). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Glassware is cleaned by detergent washing in hot water, rinsing with tap water and distilled water, capping with aluminum foil, and baking at 450 [deg]C for at least one hour. For some glassware, immersion in a chromate cleaning solution prior to detergent washing may be required. If blanks from glassware without cleaning or with fewer cleaning steps show no detectable organic halide, the cleaning steps that do not eliminate organic halide may be omitted.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Most often, contamination results from methylene chloride vapors in laboratories that perform organic extractions. Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that are shared between the extraction laboratory and the laboratory in which organic halide measurements are performed transfer the methylene chloride vapors to the air in the organic halide laboratory. Exposure of the activated carbon used in the analysis results in contamination. Separate air handling systems, charcoal filters, and glove boxes can be used to minimize this exposure.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Activated carbon.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.1 The purity of each lot of activated carbon must be verified before each use by measuring the adsorption capacity and the background level of halogen (Section 9.5). The stock of activated carbon should be stored in its granular form in a glass container that is capped tightly. Protect carbon at all times from sources of halogen vapors.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.2 Inorganic substances such as chloride, chlorite, bromide, and iodide will adsorb on activated carbon to an extent dependent on their original concentration in the aqueous solution and the volume of sample adsorbed. Treating the activated carbon with a solution of nitrate causes competitive desorption of inorganic halide species. However, if the inorganic halide concentration is greater than 2,000 times the organic halide concentration, artificially high results may be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3 Halogenated organic compounds that are weakly adsorbed on activated carbon are only partially recovered from the sample. These include certain alcohols and acids such as chloroethanol and chloroacetic acid that can be removed from activated carbon by the nitrate wash.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Polyethylene gloves should be worn when handling equipment surfaces in contact with the sample to prevent transfer of contaminants that may be present on the hands.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical substance should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these substances should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) should be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in References 9 through 11.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 This method employs strong acids. Appropriate clothing, gloves, and eye protection should be worn when handling these substances.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Field samples may contain high concentrations of toxic volatile compounds. Sample containers should be opened in a hood and handled with gloves that will prevent exposure.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Brand names, suppliers, and part numbers are for illustrative purposes only.

Some manufacturers offer an enlarged boat and combustion tube for this purpose. Under a time-

controlled sequence, the boat is first moved into an evaporation zone where water and other volatiles are evaporated, and then into the combustion zone where the carbon and all other organic material in the boat are burned in a flowing oxygen stream. The evolved gases are transported by a non-reactive carrier gas to the micro-coulometer cell.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1.4 Motor driven boat sampler: Capable of advancing the combustion boat into the furnace in a reproducible time sequence. A suggested time sequence is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. Establish initial gas flow rates: 160 mL/min CO2; 40 mL/min O2.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sequence start.</p><p class="depth0">C.

Stop integration at 10 minutes after sequence start.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the signal from the detector does not return to baseline, it may be necessary to extend the pyrolysis time.

This ability is demonstrated as described in Section 9.2.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.2 The laboratory is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements, provided that all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the laboratory is required to repeat the procedures in Sections 9.2.2 and 10 to demonstrate continued method performance. If the detection limit of the method will be affected by the modification, the laboratory should demonstrate that the MDL (40 CFR 136, appendix B) is less than or equal to the MDL in this method or one-third the regulatory compliance level, whichever is higher.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.3 The laboratory shall spike 10% of the samples with known concentrations of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to monitor method performance and matrix interferences (interferences caused by the sample matrix). This test is described in Section 9.3. When results of these spikes indicate atypical method performance for samples, the samples are diluted to bring method performance within acceptable limits.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.4 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination.

An MDL less than or equal to the MDL in Section 1.3 should be achieved prior to the practice of this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Initial precision and recovery (IPR): To establish the ability to generate acceptable precision and recovery, the laboratory shall perform the following operations:</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2.1 Analyze four aliquots of the PAR standard (Section 7.12.4) and a method blank according to the procedures in Sections 9.4 and 11.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2.2 Using the blank-subtracted results of the set of four analyses, compute the average percent recovery (X) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s) for the results.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2.3 The average percent recovery shall be in the range of 81 to 114 g/L and the standard deviation shall be less than 8 g/L. If X and s meet these acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside the range for recovery, system performance is unacceptable. In this case, correct the problem and repeat the test.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Matrix spikes: The laboratory shall spike a minimum of 10% of samples from a given matrix type (e.g., C-stage filtrate, produced water, treated effluent) in duplicate (MS/MSD).

An adsorption volume as small as 25 mL may be used, provided the concentration of AOX in the sample can be measured reliably, as defined by the requirements in Section 9.11. To minimize volumetric error, an adsorption volume less than 25 mL may not be used. If AOX cannot be measured reliably in a 100-mL sample volume, a sample volume to a maximum of 1000 mL must be used.

In addition, if it is necessary to dilute the sample for the purposes of reducing breakthrough or maintaining the concentration within the calibration range, a more or less dilute sample must be analyzed.

Method 1653--Chlorinated Phenolics in Wastewater by In Situ Acetylation</p><p class="depth0">and GCMS</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 This method is for determination of chlorinated phenolics (chlorinated phenols, guaiacols, catechols, vanillins, syringaldehydes) and other compounds associated with the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and that are amenable to in situ acetylation, extraction, and analysis by capillary column gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). This method is based on existing methods for determination of chlorophenolics in pulp and paper industry wastewaters (References 1 and 2).</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The chemical compounds listed in Table 1 may be determined in waters and, specifically, in in-process streams and

wastewaters associated with the pulp and paper industry. The method is designed to meet the survey and monitoring requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The detection limit of this method is usually dependent on the level of interferences rather than instrumental limitations. The method detection limits (MDLs) in Table 2 typify the minimum quantity that can be detected with no interferences present.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 The GCMS portions of this method are for use only by persons experienced with GCMS or under the close supervision of such qualified persons. Laboratories unfamiliar with analyses of environmental samples by GCMS should run the performance tests in Reference 3 before beginning.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 Any modification of the method beyond those expressly permitted is subject to the application and approval of alternative test procedures under 40 CFR parts 136.4 and 136.5.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A 1000-mL aliquot of water is spiked with stable isotopically labeled analogs of the compounds of interest and an internal standard. The solution is adjusted to neutral pH, potassium carbonate buffer is added, and the pH is raised to 9-11.5. The chlorophenolics are converted in situ to acetates by the addition of acetic anhydride. After acetylation, the solution is extracted with hexane. The hexane is concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 mL, an instrument internal standard is added, and an aliquot of the concentrated extract is injected into the gas chromatograph (GC). The compounds are separated by GC and detected by a mass spectrometer (MS). The labeled compounds and internal standard serve to correct the variability of the analytical technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Identification of a pollutant (qualitative analysis) is performed by comparing the relative retention time and mass spectrum to that of an authentic standard. A compound is identified when its relative retention time and mass spectrum agree.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Quantitative analysis is performed in one of two ways by GCMS using extracted ion-current profile (EICP) areas: (1) For those compounds listed in Table 1 for which standards and labeled analogs are available, the GCMS system is calibrated and the compound concentration is determined using an isotope dilution technique; (2) for those compounds listed in Table 1 for which authentic standards but no labeled compounds are available, the GCMS system is calibrated and the compound concentration is determined using an internal standard technique.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of the extraction and GCMS systems.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Chlorinated phenolics are the chlorinated phenols, guaiacols, catechols, vanillins, syringaldehydes and other compounds amenable to in situ acetylation, extraction, and determination by GCMS using this method.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Definitions for other terms used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method (Section 20.0).</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines, causing misinterpretation of chromatograms and spectra. All materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of analysis by running method blanks initially and with each sample batch (samples started through the extraction process on a given eight-hour shift, to a maximum of 20). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Glassware and, where possible, reagents are cleaned by using solvent rinse and baking at 450 [deg]C for a minimum of one hour.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Interferences co-extracted from samples will vary considerably from source to source, depending on the diversity of the site being sampled. Industry experience suggests that high levels of non-chlorinated phenols may cause poor recovery of the compounds of interest, particularly in samples collected in the vicinity of a source of creosote, such as a wood-preserving plant (Reference 1).</p><p class="depth0">4.3 The internal standard, 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, has been reported to be an anaerobic degradation product of 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol and/or pentachlorophenol (Reference 1). When an interference with this or another compound occurs, labeled pentachlorophenol or another labeled compound may be used as an alternative internal standard; otherwise, the internal standards and reference compounds must be used as specified in this method.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Blank contamination by pentachlorophenol has been reported (Reference 1) to be traceable to potassium carbonate; it has also been reported that this contamination may be removed by baking overnight at 400 to 500 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Catechols are susceptible to degradation by active sites on injection port liners and columns, and are subject to oxidation to the corresponding chloro-o-benzoquinones (Reference 2). A small amount of ascorbic acid may be added to samples to prevent auto-oxidation (Reference 2; also see Section 11.1.6). For pulp and paper industry samples, ascorbic acid may be added to treated effluent samples only.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each compound or reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these compounds should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of materials safety data sheets (MSDSs) should be made available to all personnel involved in these analyses. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in References 4 through 6.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Samples may contain high concentrations of toxic compounds, and should be handled with gloves and a hood opened to prevent exposure.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Brand names, suppliers, and part numbers are for illustrative purposes only.

The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, analysis of samples spiked with labeled compounds to evaluate and document data quality, and analysis of standards and blanks as tests of continued performance.

In this event, there may be a problem with the GCMS or with the derivatization/extraction/concentration systems.</p><p class="depth0">9.6.2.2 GCMS system: To determine if the failure of the OPR test (Section 9.6.2.1) is due to instrument drift, analyze the current calibration verification extract (Section 7.13.4), calculate the percent recoveries of all compounds, and compare with the OPR recovery limits in Table 5. If all compounds meet these criteria, GCMS performance/stability is verified, and the failure of the OPR analysis is attributed to problems in the derivatization/extraction/concentration of the OPR. In this case, analysis of the sample

extracts may proceed. However, failure of any of the recovery criteria in the analysis of a sample extract requires rederivatization of that sample (Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2).

That only a single compound is present is determined by examination of the spectrum. Fragments not attributable to the compound under study indicate the presence of an interfering compound.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 Adjust the analytical conditions and scan rate (for this test only) to produce an undistorted spectrum at the GC peak maximum. An undistorted spectrum will usually be obtained if five complete spectra are collected across the upper half of the GC peak. Software algorithms designed to ``enhance'' the spectrum may eliminate distortion, but may also eliminate authentic m/z's or introduce other distortion.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.3 The authentic reference spectrum is obtained under DFTPP tuning conditions (Section 10.1 and Table 3) to normalize it to spectra from other instruments.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.4 The spectrum is edited by removing all peaks in the m/z 42 to 45 range, and saving the five most intense mass spectral peaks and all other mass spectral peaks greater than 10% of the base peak (excluding the peaks in the m/z 42 to 45 range). The spectrum may be further edited to remove common interfering m/z's. The spectrum obtained is stored for reverse search and for compound confirmation. 10.3 Minimum level: Demonstrate that the chlorophenolics are detectable at the minimum level (per all criteria in Section 14). The nominal 5 g/mL calibration standard (Section 7.13) can be used to demonstrate this performance.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Calibration with isotope dilution: Isotope dilution is used when (1) labeled compounds are available, (2) interferences do not preclude its use, and (3) the quantitation m/z (Table 4) extracted ion-current profile (EICP) area for the compound is in the calibration range. Alternative labeled compounds and quantitation m/z's may be used based on availability. If any of the above conditions preclude isotope dilution, the internal standard calibration method (Section 10.5) is used.</p><p class="depth0">10.4.1 A calibration curve encompassing the concentration range is prepared for each compound to be determined. The relative response (pollutant to labeled) vs. concentration in standard solutions is plotted or computed using a linear regression. The example in Figure 1 shows a calibration curve for phenol using phenol-d5 as the isotopic diluent. Also shown are the [10% error limits (dotted lines). Relative response (RR) is determined according to the procedures described below. A minimum of five data points are employed for calibration.</p><p class="depth0">10.4.2 The relative response of a pollutant to its labeled analog is determined from isotope ratio values computed from acquired data. Three isotope ratios are used in this process:
Rx = the isotope ratio measured for the pure pollutant.Ry = the isotope ratio measured for the labeled compound.Rm = the isotope ratio of an analytical mixture of pollutant</p><p class="depth0">and labeled compounds.</p><p class="depth0">The m/z's are selected such that RxRy. If Rm is not between 2Ry and 0.5Rx, the method does not apply and the sample is analyzed by the internal standard method.</p><p class="depth0">10.4.3 Capillary columns sometimes separate the pollutant-labeled pair when deuterium labeled compounds are used, with the labeled compound eluted first (Figure 2). For this case,[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AP98.028</p><p class="depth0">10.4.4 When the pollutant-labeled pair is not separated (as occurs with carbon-13-labeled compounds), or when another labeled compound with interfering spectral masses overlaps the pollutant (a case which can occur with isomeric compounds), it is necessary to determine the contributions of the pollutant and labeled compound to the respective EICP areas. If the peaks are separated well enough to permit the data system or operator to remove the contributions of the compounds to each other, the equations in Section 10.4.3 apply. This usually occurs when the height of the valley between the two GC peaks at the same m/z is less than 70 to 90% of the height of the shorter of the two peaks. If significant GC and spectral overlap occur, RR is computed using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AP98.029
Where:
Rx is measured as shown in figure 3A,Ry is measured as shown in figure 3B,Rm is measured as shown in figure 3C.</p><p class="depth0">For example, Rx = 46100/4780 = 9.644; Ry = 2650/43600 = 0.0608; Rm = 49200/48300 = 1.1019; thus, RR = 1.114. 10.4.5 To calibrate the analytical system by isotope dilution, analyze a 1-L aliquot of each of the calibration standards (Section 7.13) using the procedure in Section 12. Compute the RR at each concentration.</p><p class="depth0">10.4.6 Linearity: If the ratio of relative response to concentration for any compound is constant (less than 20% coefficient of variation) over the five-point calibration range, an averaged relative response/concentration ratio may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the five-point calibration range.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Calibration by internal standard: The method contains two types of internal standards, the sample matrix internal standard (SMIS) and the instrument internal standard (IIS), and they are used for different quantitative purposes. The 3,4,5-trichlorophenol sample matrix internal standard (SMIS) is used for measurement of all pollutants with no labeled analog and when the criteria for isotope dilution (Section 10.4) cannot be met. The 2,2'-difluorobiphenyl instrument internal standard (IIS) is used for determination of the labeled compounds and the SMIS. The results are used for intralaboratory statistics (Sections 9.4.4 and 9.6.3).</p><p class="depth0">10.5.1 Response factors: Calibration requires the determination of response factors (RF) for both the pollutants with no labeled analog and for the labeled compounds and the SMIS.

The amount of SMIS added to each solution is the same (25 g/mL) so that Cis remains constant. Likewise, the concentration of IIS is constant in each solution. The area ratio (As/Ais) is plotted versus the concentration ratio (Cs/Cis) for each compound in the standard to produce a calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">10.5.3 Linearity: If the response factor (RF) for any compound is constant (less than 35% coefficient of variation) over the five-point calibration range, an averaged response factor may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the five-point range.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Combined calibration: By using calibration solutions (Section 7.13) containing the pollutants, labeled compounds, and the internal standards, a single set of analyses can be used to produce calibration curves for the isotope dilution and internal standard methods. These curves are verified each shift (Section 9) by analyzing the OPR standard, or an optional calibration verification (VER) standard.

However, for pulp and paper industry in-process streams and other in-process wastewaters, the addition of ascorbic acid may convert chloro-o-quinones to catechols if these quinones are present.
