                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, when selecting applications for non-leveraged status, the Secretary may select one or more applications, or none, for further consideration based on the evaluation criteria of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility and completeness. In addition to the requirements specified in Sec. 4290.350, an Applicant under this subpart must complete a written application that includes information not otherwise exempted by the Secretary, in his or her sole discretion. The Secretary may, on his or her own initiative, exempt material from a Non-leveraged RBIC application where the Secretary determines it impedes an expedited process without a commensurate benefit to the program. To the extent that the Secretary's exemption applies to the entire program, an announcement of the exemption will be published in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall make a decision as to licensing an Applicant after the receipt of a complete application and will enter into a Participation Agreement with the RBIC if approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of a RBIC license. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of Sec. 4290.390 do not apply to Non-leveraged RBICs.
