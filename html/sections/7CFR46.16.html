                            <p class="depth0">All records required to be preserved under the Act shall be stored in an orderly manner and in keeping with sound business practices. The records being currently used shall be filed in order of dates, by serial numbers, alphabetically or by any other proper method which will enable the licensee to promptly locate and produce the records. Records in dead storage should be arranged in an orderly fashion, be packaged or wrapped to insure proper preservation, be adequately marked or identified, and stored in a safe, dry location. When part of the records are forwarded to others (such as accountants, traffic agencies, attorneys, etc.), proper notations should be filed in appropriate places in the records identifying the missing records and stating where they can be located.</p>
