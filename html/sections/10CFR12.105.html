The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the  position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the  action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary  adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be  made to a prevailing applicant because the Commission's position was  substantially justified is on the Commission counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly  or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances  make the award sought unjust.</p>
