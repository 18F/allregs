                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General description of a  charitable remainder trust. Generally, a charitable remainder trust is a  trust which provides for a specified distribution, at least annually, to  one or more beneficiaries, at least one of which is not a charity, for  life or for a term of years, with an irrevocable remainder interest to  be held for the benefit of, or paid over to, charity. The specified  distribution to be paid at least annually must be a sum certain which is  not less than 5 percent of the initial net fair market value of all  property placed in trust (in the case of a charitable remainder annuity  trust) or a fixed percentage which is not less than 5 percent of the net  fair market value of the trust assets, valued annually (in the case of a  charitable remainder unitrust). A trust created after July 31, 1969,  which is a charitable remainder trust, is exempt from all of the taxes  imposed by subtitle A of the Code for any taxable year of the trust,  except for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, in which it  has unrelated business taxable income. For taxable years beginning after  December 31, 2006, an excise tax, treated as imposed by chapter 42, is  imposed on charitable remainder trusts that have unrelated business  taxable income. See paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Scope. This section provides definitions, general rules  governing the creation and administration of a charitable remainder  trust, and rules governing the taxation of the trust and its  beneficiaries. For the application of certain foundation rules to  charitable remainder trusts, see paragraph (b) of   this section. If the trust has unrelated business taxable income, see  paragraph (c) of this section. For the treatment of distributions to  recipients, see paragraph (d) of this section. For the treatment of  distributions to charity, see paragraph (e) of this section. For the  time limitations for amendment of governing instruments, see paragraph  (f) of this section. For transitional rules under which particular  requirements are inapplicable to certain trusts, see paragraph (g) of  this section. Section 1.664-2 provides rules relating solely to a  charitable remainder annuity trust. Section 1.664-3 provides rules  relating solely to a charitable remainder unitrust. Section 1.664-4  provides rules governing the calculation of the fair market value of the  remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust. For rules  relating to the filing of returns for a charitable remainder trust, see  paragraph (a)(6) of Sec. 1.6012-3 and section 6034 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions. As used in this section and Sec. Sec. 1.664-2,  1.664-3, and 1.664-4:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Charitable remainder trust. The term charitable remainder trust  means a trust with respect to which a deduction is allowable under  section 170, 2055, 2106, or 2522 and which meets the description of a  charitable remainder annuity trust (as described in Sec. 1.664-2) or a  charitable remainder unitrust (as described in Sec. 1.664-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Annuity amount. The term annuity amount means the amount  described in paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.664-2 which is payable, at  least annually, to the beneficiary of a charitable remainder annuity  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Unitrust amount. The term unitrust amount means the amount  described in paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.664-3 which is payable, at  least annually, to the beneficiary of a charitable remainder unitrust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recipient. The term recipient means the beneficiary who receives  the possession or beneficial enjoyment of the annuity amount or unitrust  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirement that the trust must be either a charitable remainder  annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust. A trust is a  charitable remainder trust only if it is either a charitable remainder  annuity trust in every respect or a charitable remainder unitrust in  every respect. For example, a trust which provides for the payment each  year to a noncharitable beneficiary of the greater of a sum certain or a  fixed percentage of the annual value of the trust assets is not a  charitable remainder trust inasmuch as the trust is neither a charitable  remainder annuity trust (for the reason that the payment for the year  may be a fixed percentage of the annual value of the trust assets which  is not a ``sum certain'') nor a charitable remainder unitrust (for the  reason that the payment for the year may be a sum certain which is not a  ``fixed percentage'' of the annual value of the trust assets).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Restrictions on investments. A trust is not a charitable  remainder trust if the provisions of the trust include a provision which  restricts the trustee from investing the trust assets in a manner which  could result in the annual realization of a reasonable amount of income  or gain from the sale or disposition of trust assets. In the case of  transactions with, or for the benefit of, a disqualified person, see  section 4941(d) and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the  definition of self-dealing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirement that trust must meet definition of and function  exclusively as a charitable remainder trust from its creation. In order  for a trust to be a charitable remainder trust, it must meet the  definition of and function exclusively as a charitable remainder trust  from the creation of the trust. Solely for the purposes of section 664  and the regulations thereunder, the trust will be deemed to be created  at the earliest time that neither the grantor nor any other person is  treated as the owner of the entire trust under subpart E, part 1,  subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code (relating to grantors  and others treated as substantial owners), but in no event prior to the  time property is first transferred to the trust. For purposes of the  preceding sentence, neither the grantor nor his spouse shall be   treated as the owner of the trust under such subpart E merely because  the grantor or his spouse is named as a recipient. See examples 1  through 3 of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph for illustrations of the  foregoing rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules applicable to testamentary transfers--(i) Deferral of  annuity or unitrust amount. Notwithstanding subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph and Sec. Sec. 1.664-2 and 1.664-3, for purposes of sections  2055 and 2106 a charitable remainder trust shall be deemed created at  the date of death of the decedent (even though the trust is not funded  until the end of a reasonable period of administration or settlement) if  the obligation to pay the annuity or unitrust amount with respect to the  property passing in trust at the death of the decedent begins as of the  date of death of the decedent, even though the requirement to pay such  amount is deferred in accordance with the rules provided in this  subparagraph. If permitted by applicable local law or authorized by the  provisions of the governing instrument, the requirement to pay such  amount may be deferred until the end of the taxable year of the trust in  which occurs the complete funding of the trust. Within a reasonable  period after such time, the trust must pay (in the case of an  underpayment) or must receive from the recipient (in the case of an  overpayment) the difference between:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(5)(iv)</em> of this section, compounded annually, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The annuity or unitrust amounts payable, plus interest on such  amounts computed at the rate of interest specified in paragraph  (a)(5)(iv) of this section, compounded annually.  The amounts payable shall be retroactively determined by using the  taxable year, valuation method, and valuation dates which are ultimately  adopted by the charitable remainder trust. See subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph for rules relating to retroactive determination of the  amount payable under a charitable remainder unitrust. See paragraph  (d)(4) of this section for rules relating to the year of inclusion in  the case of an underpayment to a recipient and the allowance of a  deduction in the case of an overpayment to a recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of retroactively determining the amount under  subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph, the governing instrument of a  charitable remainder unitrust may provide that the amount described in  subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph with respect to property passing  in trust at the death of the decedent for the period which begins on the  date of death of the decedent and ends on the earlier of the date of  death of the last recipient or the end of the taxable year of the trust  in which occurs the complete funding of the trust shall be computed by  multiplying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(5)(iv)</em> of this section, compounded annually, from the date  of distribution to such date by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of transfers made after November 30, 1983, for  which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, a factor equal to  1.000000 less the factor under the appropriate adjusted payout rate in  Table D in Sec. 1.664-4(e)(6) opposite the number of years in column 1  between the date of death of the decedent and the date of the earlier of  the death of the last recipient or the last day of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of transfers for which the valuation date is after  April 30, 1989, a factor equal to 1.000000 less the factor under the  appropriate adjusted payout rate in Table D in Sec. 1.664-4(e)(6)  opposite the number of years in column 1 between the date of death of  the decedent and the date of the earlier of the death of the last  recipient or the last day of such taxable year. The appropriate adjusted  payout rate is determined by using the appropriate Table F contained in  Sec. 1.664-4(e)(6) for the section 7520 rate for the month of the  valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the number of years between the date of death and the date of  the earlier of the death of the last recipient or the last day of such  taxable year is between periods for which factors are provided, a linear  interpolation must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of distributions. The treatment of a distribution to  a charitable remainder trust, or to a recipient in respect of an annuity  or unitrust amount, paid, credited, or required to be distributed by an  estate, or by a trust which is not a charitable remainder trust, shall  be governed by the rules of subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the  Code other than section 664. In the case of a charitable remainder trust  which is partially or fully funded during the period of administration  of an estate or settlement of a trust (which is not a charitable  remainder trust), the treatment of any amount paid, credited, or  required to be distributed by the charitable remainder trust shall be  governed by the rules of section 664.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rate of interest. The following rates of interest shall apply  for purposes of paragraphs (a)(5) (i) through (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The section 7520 rate for the month in which the valuation date  with respect to the transfer is (or one of the prior two months if  elected under Sec. 1.7520-2(b)) after April 30, 1989;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> 10 percent for instruments executed or amended (other than in  the case of a reformation under section 2055(e)(3)) on or after August  9, 1984, and before May 1, 1989, and not subsequently amended;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> 6 percent or 10 percent for instruments executed or amended  (other than in the case of a reformation under section 2055(e)(3)) after  October 24, 1983, and before August 9, 1984; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> 6 percent for instruments executed before October 25, 1983, and  not subsequently amended (other than in the case of a reformation under  section 2055(e)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The application of the rules in paragraphs (a)(4) and  (a)(5) of this section require the use of actuarial factors contained in  Sec. Sec. 1.664-4(e) and 1.664-4A and may be illustrated by use of the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On September 19, 1971, H transfers property to a trust  over which he retains an inter vivos power of revocation. The trust is  to pay W 5 percent of the value of the trust assets, valued annually,  for her life, remainder to charity. The trust would satisfy all of the  requirements of section 664 if it were irrevocable. For purposes of  section 664, the trust is not deemed created in 1971 because H is  treated as the owner of the entire trust under subpart E. On May 26,  1975, H predeceases W at which time the trust becomes irrevocable. For  purposes of section 664, the trust is deemed created on May 26, 1975,  because that is the earliest date on which H is not treated as the owner  of the entire trust under subpart E. The trust becomes a charitable  remainder trust on May 26, 1975, because it meets the definition of a  charitable remainder trust from its creation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that H  retains the inter vivos power to revoke only one-half of the trust. For  purposes of section 664, the trust is deemed created on September 19,  1971, because on that date the grantor is not treated as the owner of  the entire trust under subpart E. Consequently, a charitable deduction  is not allowable either at the creation of the trust or at H's death  because the trust does not meet the definition of a charitable remainder  trust from the date of its creation. The trust does not meet the  definition of a charitable remainder trust from the date of its creation  because the trust is subject to a partial power to revoke on such date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the  residue of H's estate is to be paid to the trust and the trust is  required to pay H's debts. The trust is not a charitable remainder trust  at H's death because it does not function exclusively as a charitable  remainder trust from the date of its creation which, in this case, is  the date it becomes irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1971, H transfers property to Trust A over which  he retains an inter vivos power of revocation. Trust A, which is not a  charitable remainder trust, is to provide income or corpus to W until  the death of H. Upon H's death the trust is required by its governing  instrument to pay the debts and administration expenses of H's estate,  and then to terminate and distribute all of the remaining assets to a  separate Trust B which meets the definition of a charitable remainder  annuity trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trust B will be charitable remainder trust from the date of its  funding because it will function exclusively as a charitable remainder  trust from its creation. For purposes of section 2055, Trust B will be  deemed created at H's death if the obligation to pay the annuity amount  begins on the date of H's death. For purposes of section 664, Trust B  becomes a charitable remainder trust as soon as it is partially or  completely funded.   Consequently, unless Trust B has unrelated business taxable income, the  income of the trust is exempt from all taxes imposed by subtitle A of  the Code, and any distributions by the trust, even before it is  completely funded, are governed by the rules of section 664. Any  distributions made by Trust A, including distributions to a recipient in  respect of annuity amounts, are governed by the rules of subchapter J,  chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code other than section 664.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. In 1973, H dies testate leaving the net residue of his  estate (after payment by the estate of all debts and administration  expenses) to a trust which meets the definition of a charitable  remainder unitrust. For purposes of section 2055, the trust is deemed  created at H's death if the requirement to pay the unitrust amount  begins on H's death and is a charitable remainder trust even though the  estate is obligated to pay debts and administration expenses.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of section 664, the trust becomes a charitable  remainder trust as soon as it is partially or completely funded.  Consequently, unless the trust has unrelated business taxable income,  the income of the trust is exempt from all taxes imposed by subtitle A  of the Code, and any distributions by the trust, even before it is  completely funded, are governed by the rules of section 664. Any  distributions made by H's estate, including distributions to a recipient  in respect of unitrust amounts, are governed by the rules of subchapter  J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code other than section 664.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1974, H dies testate leaving the  residue of his estate to a charitable remainder unitrust. The governing  instrument provides that, beginning at H's death, the trustee is to make  annual payments to W, on December 31 of each year of 5 percent of the  net fair market value of the trust assets, valued as of December 31 of  each year, for W's life and to pay the remainder to charity at the death  of W. The governing instrument also provides that the actual payment of  the unitrust amount need not be made until the end of the taxable year  of the trust in which occurs the complete funding of the trust. The  governing instrument also provides that the amount payable with respect  to the period between the date of death and the end of such taxable year  shall be computed under the special method provided in subparagraph  (5)(ii) of this paragraph. The governing instrument provides that,  within a reasonable period after the end of the taxable year of the  trust in which occurs the complete funding of the trust, the trustee  shall pay (in the case of an underpayment) or shall receive from the  recipient (in the case of an overpayment) the difference between the  unitrust amounts paid (plus interest at 6 percentage compounded  annually) and the amount computed under the special method. The trust is  completely funded on September 20, 1976. No amounts were paid before  June 30, 1977. The trust adopts a fiscal year of July 1 to June 30. The  net fair market value of the trust assets on June 30, 1977, is $100,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because no amounts were paid prior to the end of the taxable  year in which the trust was completely funded, the amount payable at the  end of such taxable year is equal to the net fair market value of the  trust assets on the last day of such taxable year (June 30, 1977)  multiplied by a factor equal to 1.0 minus the factor in Table D  corresponding to the number of years in the period between the date of  death and the end of such taxable year. The adjusted payout rate  (determined under Sec. 1.664-4A(c)) is 5 percent. Because the last day  of the taxable year in which the trust is completely funded in June 30,  1977, there are 3 181/365 years in such period. Because there is no  factor given in Table D for such a period, a linear interpolation must  be made:  1.0 minus 0.814506 (factor at 5 percent for 4 years)........    0.185494 1.0 minus 0.857375 (factor at 5 percent for 3 years)........     .142625</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Difference..............................................     .042869</p><p class="depth0">181/365=X/0.042869</p><p class="depth0">X=0.021258</p><p class="depth0">1.0 minus 0.857375 (factor at 5 percent for 3 years.........    0.142625 Plus: X.....................................................     .021258</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Interpolated factor.....................................     .163883</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the amount payable for the period from January 1, 1974, to June  30, 1977, is $16,388.30 ($100,000x0.163883). Thereafter, the trust  assets must be valued on December 31 of each year and 5 percent of such  value paid annually to W for her life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Valuation of unmarketable assets--(i) In general. If  unmarketable assets are transferred to or held by a trust, the trust  will not be a trust with respect to which a deduction is available under  section 170, 2055, 2106, or 2522, or will be treated as failing to  function exclusively as a charitable remainder trust unless, whenever  the trust is required to value such assets, the valuation is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Performed exclusively by an independent trustee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determined by a current qualified appraisal, as defined in Sec.  1.170A-13(c)(3), from a qualified appraiser, as defined in Sec. 1.170A- 13(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unmarketable assets. Unmarketable assets are assets that are  not cash, cash equivalents, or other assets that can be readily sold or  exchanged for   cash or cash equivalents. For example, unmarketable assets include real  property, closely-held stock, and an unregistered security for which  there is no available exemption permitting public sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Independent trustee. An independent trustee is a person who is  not the grantor of the trust, a noncharitable beneficiary, or a related  or subordinate party to the grantor, the grantor's spouse, or a  noncharitable beneficiary (within the meaning of section 672(c) and the  applicable regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(B)</em> and the  regulations thereunder for the application to charitable remainder  trusts of certain provisions relating to private foundations. See  section 508(e) for rules relating to required provisions in governing  instruments prohibiting certain activities specified in section  4947(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excise tax on charitable remainder trusts--(1) In general. For  each taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, in which a  charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust  has any unrelated business taxable income, an excise tax is imposed on  that trust in an amount equal to the amount of such unrelated business  taxable income. For this purpose, unrelated business taxable income is  as defined in section 512, determined as if part III, subchapter F,  chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code applied to such  trust. Such excise tax is treated as imposed by chapter 42 (other than  subchapter E) and is reported and payable in accordance with the  appropriate forms and instructions. Such excise tax shall be allocated  to corpus and, therefore, is not deductible in determining taxable  income distributed to a beneficiary. (See paragraph (d)(2) of this  section.) The charitable remainder trust income that is unrelated  business taxable income constitutes income of the trust for purposes of  determining the character of the distribution made to the beneficiary.  Income of the charitable remainder trust is allocated among the  charitable remainder trust income categories in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section without regard to whether any part of that income constitutes  unrelated business taxable income under section 512.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of the rules in this paragraph (c) may  be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For 2007, a charitable remainder annuity trust with a  taxable year beginning on January 1, 2007, has $60,000 of ordinary  income, including $10,000 of gross income from a partnership that  constitutes unrelated business taxable income to the trust. The trust  has no deductions that are directly connected with that income. For that  same year, the trust has administration expenses (deductible in  computing taxable income) of $16,000, resulting in net ordinary income  of $44,000. The amount of unrelated business taxable income is computed  by taking gross income from an unrelated trade or business and deducting  expenses directly connected with carrying on the trade or business, both  computed with modifications under section 512(b). Section 512(b)(12)  provides a specific deduction of $1,000 in computing the amount of  unrelated business taxable income. Under the facts presented in this  example, there are no other modifications under section 512(b). The  trust, therefore, has unrelated business taxable income of $9,000  ($10,000 minus the $1,000 deduction under section 512(b)(12)).  Undistributed ordinary income from prior years is $12,000 and  undistributed capital gains from prior years are $50,000. Under the  terms of the trust agreement, the trust is required to pay an annuity of  $100,000 for year 2007 to the noncharitable beneficiary. Because the  trust has unrelated business taxable income of $9,000, the excise tax  imposed under section 664(c) is equal to the amount of such unrelated  business taxable income, $9,000. The character of the $100,000  distribution to the noncharitable beneficiary is as follows: $56,000 of  ordinary income ($44,000 from current year plus $12,000 from prior  years), and $44,000 of capital gains. The $9,000 excise tax is allocated  to corpus, and does not reduce the amount in any of the categories of  income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. At the beginning of year  2008, the amount of undistributed capital gains is $6,000, and there is  no undistributed ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. During 2007, a charitable remainder annuity trust with a  taxable year beginning on January 1, 2007, sells real estate generating  gain of $40,000. Because the trust had obtained a loan to finance part  of the purchase price of the asset, some of the income from the sale is  treated as debt-financed income under section 514 and thus constitutes  unrelated business taxable income under section 512. The unrelated debt- financed income computed under section 514 is $30,000. Assuming the  trust receives no   other income in 2007, the trust will have unrelated business taxable  income under section 512 of $29,000 ($30,000 minus the $1,000 deduction  under section 512(b)(12)). Except for section 512(b)(12), no other  exceptions or modifications under sections 512-514 apply when  calculating unrelated business taxable income based on the facts  presented in this example. Because the trust has unrelated business  taxable income of $29,000, the excise tax imposed under section 664(c)  is equal to the amount of such unrelated business taxable income,  $29,000. The $29,000 excise tax is allocated to corpus, and does not  reduce the amount in any of the categories of income under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section. Regardless of how the trust's income might be  treated under sections 511-514, the entire $40,000 is capital gain for  purposes of section 664 and is allocated accordingly to and within the  second of the categories of income under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective/applicability date. This paragraph (c) is applicable  for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006. The rules that  apply with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007,  are contained in Sec. 1.664-1(c) as in effect prior to June 24, 2008.  (See 26 CFR part 1, Sec. 1.664-1(c)(1) revised as of April 1, 2007.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of annual distributions to recipients--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Character  of distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assignment of income to categories and classes at  the trust level. (a) A trust's income, including income includible in  gross income and other income, is assigned to one of three categories in  the year in which it is required to be taken into account by the trust.  These categories are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gross income, other than gains and amounts treated as gains from  the sale or other disposition of capital assets (referred to as the  ordinary income category);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gains and amounts treated as gains from the sale or other  disposition of capital assets (referred to as the capital gains  category); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other income (including income excluded under part III,  subchapter B, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> included  all depreciation), a qualified 5-year long-term capital gain class as  defined in section 1(h)(9) prior to amendment by the Jobs and Growth Tax  Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA), Public Law 108-27 (117 Stat.  752), and an all other long-term capital gain class. After items are  assigned to a class, the tax rates may change so that items in two or  more classes would be taxed at the same rate if distributed to the  recipient during a particular year. If the changes to the tax rates are  permanent, the undistributed items in those classes are combined into  one class. If, however, the changes to the tax rates are only temporary  (for example, the new rate for one class will sunset in a future year),  the classes are kept separate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Order of distributions. (a) The categories and classes of  income (determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) are used  to determine the character of an annuity or unitrust distribution from  the trust in the hands of the recipient irrespective of whether the  trust is exempt from taxation under section 664(c) for the year of the  distribution. The determination of the character of amounts distributed  or deemed distributed at any time during the taxable year of the trust  shall be made as of the end of that taxable year. The tax rate or rates  to be used in computing the recipient's tax on the distribution shall be  the tax rates that are applicable, in the year in which the distribution  is required to be made, to the classes of income deemed to make up that  distribution, and not the tax   rates that are applicable to those classes of income in the year the  income is received by the trust. The character of the distribution in  the hands of the annuity or unitrust recipient is determined by treating  the distribution as being made from each category in the following  order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, from ordinary income to the extent of the sum of the  trust's ordinary income for the taxable year and its undistributed  ordinary income for prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second, from capital gain to the extent of the trust's capital  gains determined under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third, from other income to the extent of the sum of the trust's  other income for the taxable year and its undistributed other income for  prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Finally, from trust corpus (with corpus defined for this purpose  as the net fair market value of the trust assets less the total  undistributed income (but not loss) in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(a) (1)  through (3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the trust has different classes of income in the ordinary  income category, the distribution from that category is treated as being  made from each class, in turn, until exhaustion of the class, beginning  with the class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate and ending  with the class subject to the lowest Federal income tax rate. If the  trust has different classes of net gain in the capital gains category,  the distribution from that category is treated as being made first from  the short-term capital gain class and then from each class of long-term  capital gain, in turn, until exhaustion of the class, beginning with the  class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate and ending with the  class subject to the lowest rate. If two or more classes within the same  category are subject to the same current tax rate, but at least one of  those classes will be subject to a different tax rate in a future year  (for example, if the current rate sunsets), the order of that class in  relation to other classes in the category with the same current tax rate  is determined based on the future rate or rates applicable to those  classes. Within each category, if there is more than one type of income  in a class, amounts treated as distributed from that class are to be  treated as consisting of the same proportion of each type of income as  the total of the current and undistributed income of that type bears to  the total of the current and undistributed income of all types of income  included in that class. For example, if rental income and interest  income are subject to the same current and future Federal income tax  rate and, therefore, are in the same class, a distribution from that  class will be treated as consisting of a proportional amount of rental  income and interest income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of losses at the trust level--(a) Ordinary income  category. A net ordinary loss for the current year is first used to  reduce undistributed ordinary income for prior years that is assigned to  the same class as the loss. Any excess loss is then used to reduce the  current and undistributed ordinary income from other classes, in turn,  beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate  and ending with the class subject to the lowest Federal income tax rate.  If any of the loss exists after all the current and undistributed  ordinary income from all classes has been offset, the excess is carried  forward indefinitely to reduce ordinary income for future years and  retains its class assignment. For purposes of this section, the amount  of current income and prior years' undistributed income shall be  computed without regard to the deduction for net operating losses  provided by section 172 or 642(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other income category. A net loss in the other income category  for the current year is used to reduce undistributed income in this  category for prior years and any excess is carried forward indefinitely  to reduce other income for future years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Netting of capital gains and losses at the trust level. Capital  gains of the trust are determined on a cumulative net basis under the  rules of this paragraph (d)(1) without regard to the provisions of  section 1212. For each taxable year, current and undistributed gains and  losses within each class are netted to determine the net gain or loss  for that class, and the classes of   capital gains and losses are then netted against each other in the  following order. First, a net loss from a class of long-term capital  gain and loss (beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal  income tax rate and ending with the class subject to the lowest rate) is  used to offset net gain from each other class of long-term capital gain  and loss, in turn, until exhaustion of the class, beginning with the  class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate and ending with the  class subject to the lowest rate. Second, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A net loss from all the classes of long-term capital gain and  loss (beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal income tax  rate and ending with the class subject to the lowest rate) is used to  offset any net gain from the class of short-term capital gain and loss;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A net loss from the class of short-term capital gain and loss is  used to offset any net gain from each class of long-term capital gain  and loss, in turn, until exhaustion of the class, beginning with the  class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate and ending with the  class subject to the lowest Federal income tax rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Carry forward of net capital gain or loss by the trust. If, at  the end of a taxable year, a trust has, after the application of  paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, any net loss or any net gain that  is not treated as distributed under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(a)(2) of this  section, the net gain or loss is carried over to succeeding taxable  years and retains its character in succeeding taxable years as gain or  loss from its particular class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Special transitional rules. To be eligible to be included in  the class of qualified dividend income, dividends must meet the  definition of section 1(h)(11) and must be received by the trust after  December 31, 2002. Long-term capital gain or loss properly taken into  account by the trust before January 1, 1997, is included in the class of  all other long-term capital gains and losses. Long-term capital gain or  loss properly taken into account by the trust on or after January 1,  1997, and before May 7, 1997, if not treated as distributed in 1997, is  included in the class of all other long-term capital gains and losses.  Long-term capital gain or loss (other than 28-percent gain (gains and  losses from collectibles and section 1202 gains), unrecaptured section  1250 gain (long-term gains not treated as ordinary income that would be  treated as ordinary income if section 1250(b)(1) included all  depreciation), and qualified 5-year gain as defined in section 1(h)(9)  prior to amendment by JGTRRA), properly taken into account by the trust  before January 1, 2003, and distributed during 2003 is treated as if it  were properly taken into account by the trust after May 5, 2003. Long- term capital gain or loss (other than 28-percent gain, unrecaptured  section 1250 gain, and qualified 5-year gain), properly taken into  account by the trust on or after January 1, 2003, and before May 6,  2003, if not treated as distributed during 2003, is included in the  class of all other long-term capital gain. Qualified 5-year gain  properly taken into account by the trust after December 31, 2000, and  before May 6, 2003, if not treated as distributed by the trust in 2003  or a prior year, must be maintained in a separate class within the  capital gains category until distributed. Qualified 5-year gain properly  taken into account by the trust before January 1, 2003, and deemed  distributed during 2003 is subject to the same current tax rate as  deemed distributions from the class of all other long-term capital gain  realized by the trust after May 5, 2003. Qualified 5-year gain properly  taken into account by the trust on or after January 1, 2003, and before  May 6, 2003, if treated as distributed by the trust in 2003, is subject  to the tax rate in effect prior to the amendment of section 1(h)(9) by  JGTRRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Application of section 643(a)(7). For application of the anti- abuse rule of section 643(a)(7) to distributions from charitable  remainder trusts, see Sec. 1.643(a)-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (d)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a charitable remainder annuity trust described in  section 664(d)(1), is created on January 1, 2003. The annual annuity  amount is $100. X's income for the 2003 tax year is as follows:  Interest income.................................................     $80</p><p class="depth0">Qualified dividend income.......................................      50 Capital gains and losses........................................       0 Tax-exempt income...............................................       0</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 2003, the year this income is received by the trust,  qualified dividend income is subject to a different rate of Federal  income tax than interest income and is, therefore, a separate class of  income in the ordinary income category. The annuity amount is deemed to  be distributed from the classes within the ordinary income category,  beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal income tax rate  and ending with the class subject to the lowest rate. Because during  2003 qualified dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than interest  income, the interest income is deemed distributed prior to the qualified  dividend income. Therefore, in the hands of the recipient, the 2003  annuity amount has the following characteristics:  Interest income.................................................     $80 Qualified dividend income.......................................      20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The remaining $30 of qualified dividend income that is not  treated as distributed to the recipient in 2003 is carried forward to  2004 as undistributed qualified dividend income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, and at the  end of 2004, X has the following classes of income:  Interest income class...........................................      $5 Qualified dividend income class ($10 from 2004 and $30 carried        40</p><p class="depth0">forward from 2003).............................................

The net  long-term capital loss in the 28-percent gain class is used to offset  the net capital gains in the other classes of long-term capital gain and  loss, beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal income tax  rate and ending with the class subject to the lowest rate. The $325 net  loss in the 28-percent gain class reduces the $175 net gain in the  unrecaptured section 1250 gain class to $0. The remaining $150 loss from  the 28-percent gain class reduces the $350 gain in the all other long- term capital gain class to $200. As in Example 1, qualified dividend  income is taxed at a lower rate than interest income during 2004. The  annuity amount is deemed to be distributed from all the classes in the  ordinary income category and then from the classes in the capital gains  category, beginning with the class subject to the highest Federal income  tax rate and ending with the class subject to the lowest rate. In the  hands of the recipient, the 2004 annuity amount has the following  characteristics:  Interest income.................................................     $ 5 Qualified dividend income.......................................      40 Net short-term capital gain.....................................      15 Net long-term capital gain in all other long-term capital gain        40</p><p class="depth0">class..........................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The remaining $160 gain in the all other long-term capital  gain class that is not treated as distributed to the recipient in 2004  is carried forward to 2005 as gain in that same class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Examples 1 and 2, and at  the end of 2005, X has the following classes of income:  Interest income class...........................................     $ 5 Qualified dividend income.......................................      20 Net loss in short-term capital gain class.......................

The $50 net short-term loss reduces  the $10 net gain in the 28-percent gain class to $0. The remaining $40  net loss reduces the $135 net gain in the unrecaptured section 1250 gain  class to $95. As in Examples 1 and 2, during 2005, qualified dividend  income is taxed at a lower rate than interest income; gain in the  unrecaptured section 1250 gain class is taxed at 25 percent; and gain in  the all other long-term capital gain class is taxed at a rate lower than  25 percent. The annuity amount is deemed to be distributed from all the  classes in the ordinary income category and then from the classes in the  capital gains category, beginning with the class subject to the highest  Federal income tax rate and ending with the class subject to the lowest  rate.

The remaining $330 net loss reduces the $160 net gain in  the all other long-term capital gain class to $0. As in Examples 1, 2  and 3, during 2006, qualified dividend income is taxed at a lower rate  than interest income. The annuity amount is deemed to be distributed  from all the classes in the ordinary income category and then from the  classes in the capital gains category, beginning with the class subject  to the highest Federal income tax rate and ending with the class subject  to the lowest rate.

To the extent required by  this paragraph, the annuity or unitrust amount is includible in the  recipient's gross income for the taxable year in which the annuity or  unitrust amount is required to be distributed even though the annuity or  unitrust amount is not distributed until after the close of the taxable  year of the trust. If a recipient has a different taxable year (as  defined in section 441 or 442) from the taxable year of the trust, the  amount he is required to include in gross income to the extent required  by this paragraph shall be included in his taxable year in which or with  which ends the taxable year of the trust in which such amount is  required to be distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments resulting from incorrect valuations. Notwithstanding  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, any payments which are made or  required to be distributed by a charitable remainder trust pursuant to  paragraph (a)(5) of this section, under paragraph (f)(3) of this section  because of an amendment to the governing instrument, or under paragraphs  (a)(1) of Sec. Sec. 1.664-2 and 1.664-3 because of an incorrect  valuation, shall, to the extent required by this paragraph, be included  in the gross income of the recipient in his taxable year in which or  with which ends the taxable year of the trust in which the amount is  paid, credited, or required to be distributed. For rules relating to  required adjustments of underpayments and overpayments of the annuity or  unitrust amounts in respect of payments made prior to the amendment of a  governing instrument, see paragraph (f)(3) of this section. There is  allowable to a recipient a deduction from gross income for any amounts  repaid to the trust because of an overpayment during the reasonable  period of administration or settlement or until the trust is fully  funded, because of an amendment, or because of an incorrect valuation,  to the extent such amounts were   included in his gross income. See section 1341 and the regulations  thereunder for rules relating to the computation of tax where a taxpayer  restores substantial amounts held under a claim of right.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rules applicable to year of recipient's death. If the taxable  year of the trust does not end with or within the last taxable year of  the recipient because of the recipient's death, the extent to which the  annuity or unitrust amount required to be distributed to him is included  in the gross income of the recipient for his last taxable year, or in  the gross income of his estate, is determined by making the computations  required under this paragraph for the taxable year of the trust in which  his last taxable year ends. (The last sentence of subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph does not apply to such amounts.) The gross income for  the last taxable year of a recipient on the cash basis includes (to the  extent required by this paragraph) amounts actually distributed to the  recipient before his death. Amounts required to be distributed which are  distributed to his estate, are included (to the extent required by this  paragraph) in the gross income of the estate as income in respect of a  decedent under section 691.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distributions in kind. The annuity or unitrust amount may be  paid in cash or in other property. In the case of a distribution made in  other property, the amount paid, credited, or required to be distributed  shall be considered as an amount realized by the trust from the sale or  other disposition of property. The basis of the property in the hands of  the recipient is its fair market value at the time it was paid,  credited, or required to be distributed. The application of these rules  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, 1971, X creates a charitable remainder  annuity trust, whose taxable year is the calendar year, under which X is  to receive $5,000 per year. During 1971, the trust receives $500 of  ordinary income. On December 31, 1971, the trust distributed cash of  $500 and a capital asset of the trust having a fair market value of  $4,500 and a basis of $2,200. The trust is deemed to have realized a  capital gain of $2,300. X treats the distribution of $5,000 as being  ordinary income of $500, capital gain of $2,300 and trust corpus of  $2,200. The basis of the distributed property is $4,500 in the hands of  X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other distributions--(1) Character of distributions.

The character of such amount shall be  determined as of the end of the taxable year of the trust in which the  distribution is made after the character of the annuity or unitrust  amount has been determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions in kind. In the case of a distribution of an  amount to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, no gain or  loss is realized by the trust by reason of a distribution in kind unless  such distribution is in satisfaction of a right to receive a  distribution of a specific dollar amount or in specific property other  than that distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The provisions of this section  are effective with respect to transfers in trust made after July 31,  1969. Any trust created (within the meaning of applicable local law)  prior to August 1, 1969, is not a charitable remainder trust even if it  otherwise satisfies the definition of a charitable remainder trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfers to pre-1970 trusts. Property transferred to a trust  created (within the meaning of applicable local law) before August 1,  1969, whose governing instrument provides that an organization described  in section 170(c) receives an irrevocable remainder interest in such  trust, shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (3) of this  paragraph, be deemed transferred to a trust created on the date of such  transfer provided that the transfer occurs after July 31, 1969, and  prior to October 18, 1971, and the transferred property and any  undistributed income therefrom is severed and placed in a separate trust  before December 31, 1972, or if later, on or before the 30th day after  the date on which any judicial proceedings begun before December 31,  1972, which are required to sever such property, become final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amendment of post-1969 trusts. A trust created (within the  meaning of applicable local law) subsequent to July 31, 1969, and prior  to December 31, 1972, which is not a charitable remainder trust at the  date of its creation, may be treated as a charitable remainder trust  from the date it would be deemed created under Sec. 1.664-1(a) (4) and  (5)(i) for all purposes: Provided, That all the following requirements  are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of the creation of the trust, the governing  instrument provides that an organization described in section 170(c)  receives an irrevocable remainder interest in such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> is to be paid, and (c)  provides that an organization described in section 170(c) receives an  irrevocable remainder interest in such trust. The mere granting of such  a power is not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subparagraph  that the governing instrument be amended in the manner and within the  time limitations of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(a)</em> Where the amount of the distributions which would have been  made by the trust to a recipient if the amended provisions of such trust  had been in effect from the time of creation of such trust exceeds the  amount of the distributions made by the trust prior to its amendment,  the trust pays an amount equal to such excess to the recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where the amount of distributions made to the recipient prior to  the amendment of the trust exceeds the amount of the distributions which  would have been made by such trust if the amended provisions of such  trust had been in effect from the time of creation of such trust, such  excess is repaid to the trust by the recipient.  See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for rules relating to the year of  inclusion in the case of an underpayment to a recipient and the  allowance of a deduction in the case of an overpayment to a recipient. A  deduction for a transfer to a charitable remainder trust shall not be  allowed until the requirements of this paragraph are met and then only  if the deduction is claimed on a timely filed return (including  extensions) or on a claim for refund filed within the period of  limitations prescribed by section 6511(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Valuation of unmarketable assets. The rules contained in  paragraph (a)(7) of this section are applicable for trusts created on or  after December 10, 1998. A trust in existence as of December 10, 1998,  whose governing instrument requires that an independent trustee value  the trust's unmarketable assets may be amended or reformed to permit a  valuation method that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of  this section for taxable years beginning on or after December 10, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Transitional effective date. Notwithstanding any other provision  of this section, Sec. 1.664-2 or Sec. 1.664-3, the requirement of  paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section that interest accrue on overpayments  and underpayments, the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this  section that the unitrust amount accruing under the formula provided  therein cease with the death of the last recipient, and the requirement  that the governing instrument of the trust contain the provisions  specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.664-2 (relating to  computation of the annuity amount in certain circumstances), paragraph  (a)(1)(v) of Sec. 1.664-3 (relating to computation of the unitrust  amount in certain circumstances), paragraphs (b) of Sec. Sec. 1.664-2  and 1.664-3 (relating to additional contributions), and paragraph  (a)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.664-3 (relating to incorrect valuations),  paragraphs (a)(6)(iv) of Sec. Sec. 1.664-2 and 1.664-3 (relating to  alternative remaindermen) shall not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A will executed on or before December 31, 1972, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The testator dies before December 31, 1975, without having  republished the will after December 31, 1972, by codicil or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The testator at no time after December 31, 1972, had the right  to change the provisions of the will which pertain to the trust, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The will is not republished by codicil or otherwise before  December 31, 1975, and the testator is on such date and at all times  thereafter under a mental disability to republish the will by codicil or  otherwise, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A trust executed on or before December 31, 1972, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The grantor dies before December 31, 1975, without having  amended the trust after December 31, 1972,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trust is irrevocable on December 31, 1972, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The trust is not amended before December 31, 1975, and the  grantor is on such date and at all times thereafter under a mental  disability to change the terms of the trust.
