A debarment of an accredited agency or approved person will automatically result in the cancellation of accreditation or approval by the Secretary, and the accrediting entity shall deny any pending request for renewal of accreditation or approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may issue a debarment order only if the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is substantial evidence that the agency or person is out of compliance with the standards in subpart F of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There has been a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply, or other aggravating circumstances indicating that continued accreditation or approval would not be in the best interests of the children and families concerned. For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``The children and families concerned'' include any children and any families whose interests have been or may be affected by the agency's or person's actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A failure to comply with Sec. 96.47 (home study requirements) shall constitute a ``serious failure to comply'' unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that such noncompliance had neither the purpose nor the effect of determining the outcome of a decision or proceeding by a court or other competent authority in the United States or the child's country of origin; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Repeated serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply with Sec. 96.47 (home study requirements) by an agency or person after consultation between the Secretary and the accrediting entity with respect to previous noncompliance by such agency or person shall constitute a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply.</p>
