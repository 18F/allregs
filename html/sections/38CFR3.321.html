                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of rating schedule. The 1945 Schedule for Rating  Disabilities will be used for evaluating the degree of disabilities in  claims for disability compensation, disability and death pension, and in  eligibility determinations. The provisions contained in the rating  schedule will represent as far as can practicably be determined, the  average impairment in earning capacity in civil occupations resulting  from disability.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1155)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptional cases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compensation. Ratings shall be based as  far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity  with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time  readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience. To  accord justice, therefore, to the exceptional case where the schedular  evaluations are found to be inadequate, the Under Secretary for Benefits  or the Director, Compensation Service, upon field station submission, is  authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set forth in this  paragraph an extra-schedular evaluation commensurate with the average  earning capacity impairment due exclusively to the service-connected  disability or disabilities. The governing norm in these exceptional  cases is: A finding that the case presents such an exceptional or  unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked  interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as  to render impractical the application of the regular schedular  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pension. Where the evidence of record establishes that an  applicant for pension who is basically eligible fails to meet the  disability requirements based on the percentage standards of the rating  schedule but is found to be unemployable by reason of his or her  disability(ies), age, occupational background and other related factors,  the following are authorized to approve on an extra-schedular basis a  permanent and total disability rating for pension purposes: the Veterans  Service Center Manager or the Pension Management Center Manager; or  where regular schedular standards are met as of the date of the rating  decision, the rating board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective dates. The effective date of these extra-schedular  evaluations granting or increasing benefits will be in accordance with  Sec.  3.400(b)(1) and (2) as to original and reopened claims and in  accordance with Sec.  3.400(o) in claims for increased benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advisory opinion. Cases in which application of the schedule is  not understood or the propriety of an extra-schedular rating is  questionable may be submitted to Central Office for advisory opinion.</p><p class="depth2">Cross References: Effective dates; disability benefits.
