                            <p class="depth0">Subject to the provisions of Sec. 4006.5 (dealing with exemptions  and special rules) and Sec. 4006.7 (dealing with premiums for certain  terminated single-employer plans), the premium paid for basic benefits  guaranteed under section 4022(a) or section 4022A(a) of ERISA shall  equal the flat-rate premium under paragraph (a) of this section   plus, in the case of a single-employer plan, the variable-rate premium  under paragraph (b) of this section. Premium rates (and the MAP-21 cap  rate referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are subject to  change each year under inflation indexing provisions in section 4006 of  ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flat-rate premium. The flat-rate premium for a plan is equal to  the applicable flat premium rate multiplied by the plan's participant  count. The applicable flat premium rate is the amount prescribed for the  calendar year in which the premium payment year begins by the applicable  provisions of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(A), (F), and (G) for a single-employer  plan, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(A), (H), and (J) for a multiemployer  plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Variable-rate premium--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Subject to the cap  provisions in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the  variable-rate premium for a single-employer plan is equal to a specified  dollar amount for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of the plan's  unfunded vested benefits as determined under Sec. 4006.4 for the UVB  valuation year. The specified dollar amount is the applicable variable  premium rate prescribed by the applicable provisions of ERISA section  4006(a)(8) for the calendar year in which the premium payment year  begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> MAP-21 cap. The variable-rate premium for a plan is not more  than the applicable MAP-21 cap rate multiplied by the plan's participant  count. The applicable MAP-21 cap rate is the amount prescribed by the  applicable provisions of ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(i)(II),  (E)(i)(III), (K), and (L) for the calendar year in which the premium  payment year begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Small-employer cap. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a plan is described in  paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for the premium payment year, the  variable-rate premium is not more than $5 multiplied by the square of  the participant count. For example, if the participant count is 20, the  variable-rate premium is not more than $2,000 ($5 x 20\2\ = $5 x 400 =  $2,000).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section for the premium payment year if the aggregate  number of employees of all employers in the plan's controlled group on  the first day of the premium payment year is 25 or fewer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meaning of ``employee.'' For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)  of this section, the aggregate number of employees is determined in the  same manner as under section 410(b)(1) of the Code, taking into account  the provisions of section 414(m) and (n) of the Code, but without regard  to section 410(b)(3), (4), and (5) of the Code.
