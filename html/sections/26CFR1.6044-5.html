                                Sec. 1.6044-5  Statements to recipients of patronage dividends.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> and Sec. 1.6044-2 must furnish a statement to  each recipient whose identifying number is required to be shown on the  related information return for patronage dividends paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form, manner, and time for providing statements to recipients.  The statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be either  the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for  the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement. The  rules under Sec. 1.6042-4 (relating to statements with respect to  dividends) apply comparably in determining the form of an acceptable  substitute statement permitted by this section. Those rules also apply  for purposes of determining the manner of and time for providing the  Form 1099 or its acceptable substitute to a recipient under this  section. However, each Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement  required by this section must be furnished on or before January 31 of  the following year, but no statement may be furnished before the final  payment has been made for the calendar year. For a statement required to  be furnished after December 31, 2008, the February 15 due date under  section 6045 applies to the statement if the statement is furnished in a  consolidated reporting statement under section 6045. See Sec. Sec.  1.6045-1(k)(3), 1.6045-2(d)(2), 1.6045-3(e)(2), 1.6045-4(m)(3), and  1.6045-5(a)(3)(ii). An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN)  may be used as the identifying number of the recipient in lieu of the  identifying number appearing on the corresponding information return  filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the  use of TTINs, see Sec. 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and  Administration Regulations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross-reference to penalty. For provisions relating to the  penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement  required under section 6044(e), see Sec. 301.6722-1 of this chapter  (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See Sec. 301.6724-1 of this  chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable  cause and is not due to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is effective for  payee statements due after December 31, 1995, without regard to  extensions. The amendments to paragraph (b) are effective for payee  statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before  January 1, 2015, Sec. 1.6044-5(b) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1,  revised April 2013) shall apply.  [T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66111, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8734, 62 FR  53476, Oct. 14, 1997; T.D. 9504, 75 FR 64090, Oct. 18, 2010; T.D. 9675,  79 FR 41129, July 15, 2014]</p>
