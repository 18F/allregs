                                Sec. 1223.22  How must agencies protect vital records?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Agencies must take appropriate measures to ensure the survival of  the vital records or copies of vital records in case of an emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duplication. Agencies may choose to duplicate vital records as  the primary protection method. Duplication can be to the same medium as  the original record or to a different medium. When agencies choose  duplication as a protection method, the copy of the vital record stored  off-site is normally a duplicate of the original record. The agency may  store the original records off-site if their protection is necessary, or  if it does not need to keep the original records at its normal place of  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dispersal. Once records are duplicated, they must be dispersed  to sites a sufficient distance away to avoid being subject to the same  emergency. Dispersal sites may be other office locations of the same  agency or some other site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Storage considerations. Copies of emergency operating vital  records must be accessible in a very short period of time for use in the  event of an emergency. Copies of legal and financial rights records may  not be needed as quickly. In deciding where to store vital record  copies, agencies must treat records that have the properties of both  categories, that is, emergency operating and legal and financial rights  records, as emergency operating records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The off-site copy of legal and financial rights vital records  may be stored at an off-site agency location or, in accordance with  Sec. 1233.12 of this subchapter, at a records storage facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When using a NARA records storage facility for storing vital  records that are duplicate copies of original records, the agency must  specify on the SF 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, that they are  vital records (duplicate copies) and the medium on which they are  maintained. The agency must also periodically cycle (update) them by  removing obsolete items and replacing them with the most recent version.</p>
