                            <p class="depth0">This section describes an engine family's useful life, which is the  period during which engines are required to comply with all emission  standards that apply. The useful life period is five years or a number  of hours of operation, whichever comes first, as described in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the useful life period for exhaust requirements as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this  section, the useful life period for exhaust requirements is the number  of engine operating hours from Table 1 to this section that most closely  matches the expected median in-use life of your engines. The median in- use life of your engine is the shorter of the following values:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The median in-use life of equipment into which the engine is  expected to be installed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The median in-use life of the engine without being scrapped or  rebuilt.</p><p class="depth4">Table 1 to Sec.   1054.107--Nominal Useful Life Periods ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Nonhandheld -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Extended life</p><p class="depth4">Residential     residential     Commercial</p><p class="depth4">\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Class I.........................................................             125             250             500 Class II........................................................             250             500           1,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Handheld -------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Light use            Medium use      Heavy use ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Class III--V                   50                  125      300 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Or ``General Purpose.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may select a longer useful life for nonhandheld engines than  that specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in 100-hour  increments not to exceed 3,000 hours for Class I engines or 5,000 hours  for Class II engines. For engine families generating emission credits,  you may do this only with our approval. These are considered ``Heavy  Commercial'' engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The minimum useful life period for engines with maximum engine  power above 19 kW is 1,000 hours (see Sec.  1054.1(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Keep any available information to support your selection and  make it available to us if we ask for it. We may require you to certify  to a different useful life value from the table if we determine that the  selected useful life value is not justified by the data. We may consider  any relevant information, including your product warranty statements and  marketing materials regarding engine life, in making this determination.  We may void your certificate if we determine that you intentionally  selected an incorrect value. Support your selection based on any of the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surveys of the life spans of the equipment in which the subject  engines are installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engineering evaluations of field aged engines to ascertain when  engine performance deteriorates to the point where usefulness and/or  reliability is impacted to a degree sufficient to necessitate overhaul  or replacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure reports from engine customers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engineering evaluations of the durability, in hours, of specific  engine technologies, engine materials, or engine designs.</p>
