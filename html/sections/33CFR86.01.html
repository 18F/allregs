                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Frequencies and range of audibility. The fundamental frequency  of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700 Hz. The range of  audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those  frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher  frequencies, which lie within the range 180-700 Hz (1%) for a vessel of 20 meters or more in length, or 180- 2100 Hz (1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters  in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limits of fundamental frequencies. To ensure a wide variety of  whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be  between the following limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 meters or more in length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 meters but less than 200 meters in  length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 meters in length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sound signal intensity and range of audibility.</p><p class="depth2">A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of  maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 meter from it, a  sound pressure level in at least one \1/3\rd-octave band within the  range of frequencies 180-700 Hz (1%) for a vessel  of 20 meters or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters in length, of  not less than the appropriate figure given in Table 86.01(c) of this  section. The range of audibility in Table 86.01(c) is the approximate  range at which a whistle may be heard on its forward axis with 90%  probability in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average  background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the  octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63 dB in the octave band centered on  500 Hz). It is shown for information purposes only. In practice, the  range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends  critically on weather conditions; the values given can be regarded as  typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient noise level  at the listening post the range may be reduced.</p><p class="depth2">Table 86.01(c) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1/3\rd-octave band</p><p class="depth2">level at 1 meter in dB     Audibility range in</p><p class="depth2">Length of vessel in meters                    referred to 2 x 10-5N/       nautical miles</p><p class="depth2">m\2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 200 or more..................................................                      143                       2 75 but less than 200.........................................                      138                       1.5 20 but less than 75..........................................                      130                       1 Less than 20.................................................                  \1\ 120                       0.5</p><p class="depth2">\2\ 115</p><p class="depth2">\3\ 111 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ When the measured frequencies lie within the range 180-450 Hz. \2\ When the measured frequencies lie within the range 450-800 Hz. \3\ When the measured frequencies lie within the range 800-2100 Hz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Directional properties. The sound pressure level of a  directional whistle shall be not more than 4 dB below the sound pressure  level, specified in paragraph (c) of this section, in any direction in  the horizontal plane within 45 degrees of the  forward axis. The sound pressure level of the whistle in any other  direction in the horizontal plane shall not be more than 10 dB less than   the sound pressure level specified for the forward axis, so that the  range of audibility in any direction will be at least half the range  required on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured  in that one \1/3\\rd\-octave band which determines the audibility range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Positioning of whistles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> When a directional whistle is to be  used as the only whistle on the vessel and is permanently installed, it  shall be installed with its forward axis directed forward.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel,  in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and  also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure  level of the vessel's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110  dB(A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fitting of more than one whistle. If whistles are fitted at a  distance apart of more than 100 meters, they shall not be sounded  simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Combined whistle systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A combined whistle system is a  number of whistles (sound emitting sources) operated together. For the  purposes of the Rules of Subchapter E a combined whistle system is to be  regarded as a single whistle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The whistles of a combined system shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Be sounded simultaneously;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of the  others by at least 10 Hz; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length of vessel  which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistles in the  combined system having fundamental frequencies falling within the limits  prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, or if there are only two  whistles in the combined system, by the higher fundamental frequency  falling within the limits prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (g): If, due to the presence of obstructions, the  sound field of a single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in  paragraph (f) of this section is likely to have a zone of greatly  reduced signal level, a combined whistle system should be fitted so as  to overcome this reduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Towing vessel whistles. A power-driven vessel normally engaged  in pushing ahead or towing alongside may, at all times, use a whistle  whose characteristic falls within the limits prescribed by paragraph (b)  of this section for the longest customary composite length of the vessel  and its tow.</p>
