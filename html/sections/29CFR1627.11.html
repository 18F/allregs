                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Submission of petitions for relief. Each employer, employment  agency, or labor organization who for good cause wishes to maintain  records in a manner other than required in this part, or to be relieved  of preserving certain records for the period or periods prescribed in  this part, may submit in writing a petition to the Commission requesting  such relief setting forth the reasons therefor and proposing alternative  recordkeeping or record-retention procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action on petitions. If, no review of the petition and after  completion of any necessary or appropriate investigation supplementary  thereto, the Commission shall find that the alternative procedure  proposed, if granted, will not hamper or interfere with the enforcement  of the Act, and will be of equivalent usefulness in its enforcement, the   Commission may grant the petition subject to such conditions as it may  determine appropriate and subject to revocation. Whenever any relief  granted to any person is sought to be revoked for failure to comply with  the conditions of the Commission, that person shall be notified in  writing of the facts constituting such failure and afforded an  opportunity to achieve or demonstrate compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance after submission of petitions. The submission of a  petition or any delay of the Commission in acting upon such petition  shall not relieve any employer, employment agency, or labor organization  from any obligations to comply with this part. However, the Commission  shall give notice of the denial of any petition with due promptness.</p>
