                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. In order for the equal pay standard to apply, the  jobs are required to be performed under similar working conditions. It  should be noted that the EPA adopts the flexible standard of similarity  as a basis for testing this requirement. In determining whether the  requirement is met, a practical judgment is required in light of whether  the differences in working conditions are the kind customarily taken  into consideration in setting wage levels. The mere fact that jobs are  in different departments of an establishment will not necessarily mean  that the jobs are performed under dissimilar working conditions. This  may or may not be the case. The term ``similar working conditions''  encompasses two subfactors: ``surroundings'' and ``hazards.''  ``Surroundings'' measure the elements, such as toxic chemicals or fumes,  regularly encountered by a worker, their intensity and their frequency.  ``Hazards'' take into account the physical hazards regularly  encountered, their frequency and the severity of injury they can cause.  The phrase ``working conditions'' does not encompass shift  differentials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining similarity of working conditions. Generally,  employees performing jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and  responsibility are likely to be performing them under similar working  conditions. However, in situations where some employees performing work  meeting these standards have working conditions substantially different  from those required for the performance of other jobs, the equal pay  principle would not apply. On the other hand, slight or inconsequential  differences in working conditions which are not usually taken into  consideration by employers or in collective bargaining in setting wage  rates would not justify a differential in pay.</p>
