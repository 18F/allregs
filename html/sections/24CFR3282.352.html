A  State which acts as an IPIA but is not approved as an SAA may not act as  the exclusive IPIA in the State. A State which acts as an exclusive IPIA  shall be staffed to provide IPIA services to all manufacturers within  the state and may not charge unreasonable fees for those services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(11)</em>, each State shall  submit fee schedules for its activities and, where appropriate, the fees  presently charged for DAPIA and IPIA services, and any fees charged for  DAPIA and IPIA services during the preceding two calendar years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A State's status as an exclusive IPIA shall commence upon  approval of the State Plan Application and acceptance of the State's  submission under Sec. 3282.355. Where a private organization accepted  or provisionally accepted as an IPIA under this subpart H is operating  in a manufacturing plant within the State on the date the State's status  as an exclusive IPIA commences, the private organization may provide  IPIA services in that plant for 90 days after that date.
