                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of sections 4965 and 6033(a)(2), a tax-exempt entity is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction if the entity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilitates a prohibited tax shelter transaction by reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent or tax-favored status; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is identified in published guidance, by type, class or role, as a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Published guidance may identify which tax-exempt entities, by type, class or role, will not be treated as a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principle of paragraph (a)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A tax-exempt entity enters into a transaction (Transaction A) with an S corporation. Transaction A is the same as or substantially similar to the transaction identified by the Secretary as a listed transaction in Notice 2004-30 (2004-1 CB 828). The tax-exempt entity's role in Transaction A is similar to the role of the tax-exempt party, as described in Notice 2004-30. Under the terms of the transaction, as described in Notice 2004-30, the tax-exempt entity receives the S corporation stock and purports to aid the S corporation and its shareholders in avoiding taxable income. The tax-exempt entity facilitates Transaction A by reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent or tax-favored status. Accordingly, the tax-exempt entity is a party to Transaction A for purposes of sections 4965 and 6033(a)(2). See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability dates. See Sec. 53.4965-9 for the discussion of the relevant effective and applicability dates.
