                                Sec. 1261.417  Referral to Department of Justice (DJ) or General
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prompt referral. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, claims on which aggressive collection action has been taken in accordance with Sec. 1261.406 and which cannot be compromised, or on which collection action cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1261.414 and 1261.416, shall be promptly referred to the Department of Justice for litigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims for which the gross original amount is over $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. Referrals should be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection action and the observance of the regulations contained in this subpart, and in any event, well within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily, referrals should be made within l year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum amount. NASA is not to refer claims of less than $600, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, for litigation unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The debtor not only has the clear ability to pay the claim but the Government can effectively enforce payment, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims arising from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by agencies must be referred to the GAO for review and approval prior to referral to the Department of Justice for litigation, unless NASA has been granted an exception by the GAO. Referrals shall comply with instructions, including monetary limitations, contained in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance to Federal Agencies and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the merits of the claim, the amount owed on the claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, suspension, or termination are in doubt, the designated official should refer the matter to the General Accounting Office for resolution and instructions prior to proceeding with collection action and/or referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Once a claim has been referred to GAO or to the Department of Justice pursuant to this section, NASA shall refrain from having any contact with the debtor about the pending claim and shall direct the debtor to GAO or to the DJ, as appropriate, when questions concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. GAO or the DJ, as appropriate, shall be immediately notified by NASA of any payments which are received from the debtor subsequent to referral of a claim under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). Unless an exception has been granted by the Department of Justice in consultation with the General Accounting Office, the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), which was officially implemented by NASA, effective March 1, 1983, shall be used with all referrals of administratively uncollectible claims. As required by the CCLR, the following information must be included:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report of prior collection actions. A checklist or brief summary of the actions previously taken to collect or compromise the claim. If any of the administrative collection actions have been omitted, the reason for their omission must be provided. GAO, the United States Attorney, or the Civil Division of the Department of Justice may return claims at their option when there is insufficient justification for the omission of one or more of the administrative collection actions enumerated in this subpart (see 4 CFR part 102).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Current address of debtor. The current address of the debtor, or the name and address of the agent for a corporation upon whom service may be made. Reasonable and appropriate steps will be taken to locate missing parties in all cases. Referrals to the Department

of Justice for the commencement of foreclosure of other proceedings, in which the current address of any party is unknown, will be accompanied by a listing of the prior known addresses of such party and a statement of the steps taken to locate that party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Credit data. Reasonably current credit data which indicates that there is a reasonable prospect of effecting enforced collection from the debtor, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government. Such credit data may take the form of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A commercial credit report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An agency investigative report showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual debtor's own financial statement executed under penalty of perjury reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An audited balance sheet of a corporate debtor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasons for credit data omissions. The credit data may be omitted if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A surety bond is available in an amount sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The forced sale value of the security available for application to the Government's claim is sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NASA wishes to liquidate loan collateral through judicial foreclosure but does not desire a deficiency judgment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The debtor is in bankruptcy or receivership;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The debtor's liability to the Government is fully covered by insurance, in which case NASA will furnish such information as it can develop concerning the identity and address of the insurer and the type and amount of insurance coverage; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The status of the debtor is such that credit data is not normally available or cannot reasonably be obtained, for example, a unit of State or local government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Preservation of evidence. Care will be taken to preserve all files, records, and exhibits on claims referred or to be referred to the Department of Justice for litigation. Under no circumstances should original documents be sent to the Department of Justice or the United States Attorney without specific prior approval to do so. Copies of relevant documents should be sent whenever necessary.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 1261.5_Administrative Offset of Claims</p><p class="depth2">Source: 52 FR 19487, May 26, 1987, unless otherwise noted.</p>
