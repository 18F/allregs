                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are no CPSC actions which ordinarily produce significant  environmental effects. Therefore, there are no actions for which an  environmental impact statement is normally required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following categories of CPSC actions have the potential of  producing environmental effects and therefore, normally require  environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact  statements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regulatory actions dealing with health risks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actions requiring the destruction or disposal of large  quantities of products or components of products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction, relocation, or major renovation of CPSC  facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recommendations or reports to Congress on proposed legislation  that will substantially affect the scope of CPSC authority or the use of  CPSC resources, authorize construction or razing of facilities, or  dislocate large numbers of employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Enforcement actions which result in the widespread use of  substitute products, which may present health risks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following categories of CPSC actions normally have little or  no potential for affecting the human environment; and therefore, neither  an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is  required. (These categories are termed ``categorical exclusions'' in the  NEPA regulations; see Sec. Sec. 1507.3(b)(2) and 1508.4):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rules or safety standards to provide design or performance  requirements for products, or revision, amendment, or revocation of such  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Product certification or labeling rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rules requiring poison prevention packaging of products or  exempting products from poison prevention packaging rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative proceedings to require individual manufacturers  to give notice of and/or to correct, repair, replace, or refund the  purchase price of banned or hazardous products. Other administrative  adjudications which are primarily law enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recommendations or reports to Congress on proposed legislation  to amend, delete or add procedural provisions to existing CPSC statutory  authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Decisions on petitions for rulemaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Issuance of subpoenas, general orders, and special orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In exceptional circumstances, actions within category in  paragraph (c) of this section (``categorical exclusions'') may produce  effects on the human environment. Upon a determination by the Executive  Director that a normally excluded proposed action may have such an  effect, an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant  impact or an environmental impact statement shall be prepared.</p>
