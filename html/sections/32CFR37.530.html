Cash contributions clearly demonstrate commitment and they are strongly preferred over in-kind contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> They are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the research project's objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> They are costs that may be charged to the project under Sec. 37.625 and Sec. 37.635, as applicable to the participant making the contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> They are verifiable from the recipient's records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> They are not included as cost sharing contributions for any other Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Costs that are authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Independent research and development (IR&D;) costs, as described at 32 CFR 34.13(a)(5)(ii), that meet all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. IR&D; is acceptable as cost sharing, even though it may be reimbursed by the Government through other awards. It is standard business practice for all for-profit firms, including commercial firms, to recover their research and development (R&D;) costs (which for Federal procurement contracts is recovered as IR&D;) through prices charged to their customers. Thus, the cost principles at 48 CFR part 31 allow a for-profit firm that has expenditure-based, Federal procurement contracts to recover through those procurement contracts the allocable portion of its R&D; costs associated with a technology investment agreement.</p>
