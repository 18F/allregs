                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em>, a vessel  issued a limited access NE multispecies permit may not fish for,  possess, or land regulated species, except during a DAS, as allocated  under, and in accordance with, the applicable DAS program described in  this section, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)(J)</em>, for the entire fishing year preceding the carry- over year, limited access vessels that have unused DAS on the last day  of April of any year may carry over a maximum of 10 DAS into the next  year. Unused leased DAS may not be carried over. Vessels that have been  sanctioned through enforcement proceedings will be credited with unused  DAS based on their DAS allocation minus any total DAS that have been  sanctioned through enforcement proceedings. For the 2004 fishing year  only, DAS carried over from the 2003 fishing year will be classified as  Regular B DAS, as specified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  Beginning with the 2005 fishing year, for vessels with a balance of both  unused Category A DAS and unused Category B DAS at the end of the  previous fishing year (e.g., for the 2005 fishing year, carry-over DAS  from the 2004 fishing year), Category A DAS will be carried over first,  than Regular B DAS, than Reserve B DAS. Category C DAS cannot be carried  over.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any vessel  issued a NE multispecies limited access permit may not call into the DAS  program and fish under a DAS, fish on a sector trip, or fish under the  provisions of a limited access Small Vessel Category or Handgear A  permits pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section,  respectively, if such vessel carries passengers for hire for any portion  of a fishing trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(5)</em> and (6) of this section, respectively, NE multispecies  DAS available for use will be calculated pursuant to paragraphs (c) and  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. The number and categories  of DAS that are allocated for use in a given fishing year are specified  in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iv)</em> when fishing in the respective regulated mesh areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Combination vessel category. To be eligible for a Combination  vessel category permit, a vessel must have been issued a Combination  vessel category   permit for the preceding year, be replacing a vessel that was issued a  Combination vessel category permit for the preceding year, or be  replacing a vessel that was issued a Combination vessel category permit  that was also issued a Confirmation of Permit History. Beginning May 1,  2004, for a vessel fishing under the Combination vessel category, the  baseline for determining the number of NE multispecies DAS available for  use shall be calculated based upon the fishing history associated with  the vessel's permit, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.  The number and categories of DAS that are allocated for use in a given  fishing year are specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)</em>, (b)(2)(iii), and (c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Small Vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel qualified  and electing to fish under the Small Vessel category may retain up to  300 lb (136.1 kg) of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder, combined,  and one Atlantic halibut per trip, without being subject to DAS  restrictions, provided the vessel does not exceed the yellowtail  flounder possession restrictions specified at Sec. 648.86(g). Such a  vessel is subject to the possession limits specified for other regulated  species and ocean pout, as specified at Sec. 648.86. Any vessel may  elect to switch into the Small Vessel category, as provided in  Sec. 648.4(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(I)(2)</em>, if the vessel meets or complies with the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vessel is 30 ft (9.1 m) or less in length overall, as  determined by measuring along a horizontal line drawn from a  perpendicular raised from the outside of the most forward portion of the  stem of the vessel to a perpendicular raised from the after most portion  of the stern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If construction of the vessel was begun after May 1, 1994, the  vessel must be constructed such that the quotient of the length overall  divided by the beam is not less than 2.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Acceptable verification for vessels 20 ft (6.1 m) or less in  length shall be USCG documentation or state registration papers. For  vessels over 20 ft (6.1 m) in length overall, the measurement of length  must be verified in writing by a qualified marine surveyor, or the  builder, based on the vessel's construction plans, or by other means  determined acceptable by the Regional Administrator. A copy of the  verification must accompany an application for a NE multispecies permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Adjustments to the Small Vessel category requirements, including  changes to the length requirement, if required to meet fishing mortality  goals, may be made by the Regional Administrator following framework  procedures of Sec. 648.90.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> shall be adjusted to be the same as  the applicable cod trip limit specified for NE multispecies DAS permits.  For example, if the GOM cod trip limit for NE multispecies DAS vessels  was reduced to 250 lb (113.4 kg) per DAS, then the cod trip   limit for a vessel issued a Handgear A category permit that is fishing  in the GOM Regulated Mesh Area would also be reduced to 250 lb (113.4  kg). Qualified vessels electing to fish under the Handgear A category  are subject to the following restrictions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vessel must not use or possess on board gear other than  handgear while in possession of, fishing for, or landing NE  multispecies, and must have at least one standard tote on board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A vessel may not fish for, possess, or land regulated species  from March 1 through March 20 of each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tub-trawls must be hand-hauled only, with a maximum of 250  hooks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Declaration. For any such vessel that is not required to use  VMS pursuant to Sec. 648.10(b)(4), to fish for GB cod south of the GOM  Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or  operator must obtain, and retain on board, a letter of authorization  from the Regional Administrator stating an intent to fish south of the  GOM Regulated Mesh Area and may not fish in any other area for a minimum  of 7 consecutive days from the effective date of the letter of  authorization. For any such vessel that is required, or elects, to use  VMS pursuant to Sec. 648.10(b)(4), to fish for GB cod south of the GOM  Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or  operator must declare an intent to fish south of the GOM Regulated Mesh  Area on each trip through the VMS prior to leaving port, in accordance  with instructions provided by the Regional Administrator. Such vessels  may transit the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at  Sec. 648.80(a)(1), provided that their gear is stowed and not available  for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.

For all valid limited access NE  multispecies DAS permits, and NE multispecies Confirmation of Permit  Histories, beginning with the 2004 fishing year, DAS shall be allocated  and available for use for a given fishing year according to the  following DAS Categories (unless otherwise specified, ``NE multispecies   DAS'' refers to any authorized category of DAS):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.  An additional 36 percent of Category A DAS will be added and available  for use for participants in the Large Mesh Individual DAS permit  category, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided the  participants comply with the applicable gear restrictions. Category A  DAS may be used in the NE multispecies fishery to harvest and land  stocks of regulated species or ocean pout, in accordance with all of the  conditions and restrictions of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the 2004 and 2005 fishing years, Category A DAS are defined  as 60 percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the 2006 through 2008 fishing years, Category A DAS are  defined as 55 percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For fishing year 2009 (May 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010),  Category A DAS are defined as 45 percent of the vessel's used DAS  baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Starting in fishing year 2010 (beginning May 1, 2010), Category  A DAS are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For a vessel fishing under the provisions of the common pool, as  defined in this part, Category A DAS are defined as 27.5 percent of the  vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, unless otherwise revised pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this  section, or reduced pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For a sector vessel, Category A DAS allocated for use when  fishing in other fisheries that require the concurrent use of a NE  multispecies DAS are defined as 45 percent of the vessel's used DAS  baseline specified in paragraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Regular B DAS--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Restrictions on use. Regular B DAS can only  be used by NE multispecies vessels in an approved SAP or in the Regular  B DAS Program as specified in Sec. 648.85(b)(6).

A vessel standing by an entangled whale may transfer  its stand-by status to another vessel while waiting for an authorized  response team to arrive, provided it notifies the USCG and the Center  for Coastal Studies, or another organization authorized by the Regional  Administrator, of the transfer. The vessel to which stand-by status is  transferred must also notify the USCG and the Center for Coastal Studies  or another organization authorized by the Regional Administrator of this  transfer and comply with the conditions and restrictions of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The stand-by vessel must be available to answer questions on  the condition of the animal, possible species identification, severity  of entanglement, etc., and take photographs of the whale, if possible,  regardless of the species of whale or whether the whale is alive or  dead, during its stand-by status and after terminating its stand-by  status. The stand-by vessel must remain on scene until the USCG or an  authorized response team arrives, or the vessel is informed that an  authorized response team will not arrive. If the vessel receives notice  that a response team is not available, the vessel may discontinue  standing-by the entangled whale and continue fishing operations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To receive credit for standing by an entangled whale, a vessel  must submit a written request to the Regional Administrator. This  request must include at least the following information: Date and time  when the vessel began its stand-by status; date of first communication  with the USCG; and date and time when the vessel terminated its stand-by  status. DAS credit shall not be granted for the time a vessel fishes  when standing by an entangled whale. Upon a review of the request, NMFS  shall consider granting the DAS credit based on information available at  the time of the request, regardless of whether an authorized response  team arrives on scene or a rescue is attempted. NMFS shall notify the  permit holder of any DAS adjustment that is made or explain the reasons  why an adjustment will not be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Spawning season restrictions. A vessel issued a valid Small  Vessel or Handgear A category permit specified in paragraphs (b)(5) or  (b)(6) of this section, respectively, or a vessel issued an open access  Handgear B permit, as specified in Sec. 648.88(a), may not fish for,  possess, or land regulated species or ocean pout from March 1 through  March 20 of each year. A common pool vessel must declare out and be out  of the NE multispecies DAS program, and a sector must declare that the  vessel will not fish with gear capable of catching NE multispecies  (i.e., gear that is not defined as exempted gear under this part), for a  20-day period between March 1 and May 31 of each calendar year, using  the notification requirements specified in Sec. 648.10. A vessel fishing  under a Day gillnet category designation is prohibited from fishing with  gillnet gear capable of catching NE multispecies during its declared 20- day spawning block, unless the vessel is fishing in an exempted fishery,  as described in Sec. 648.80. If a vessel owner has not declared and been  out of the fishery for a 20-day period between March 1 and May 31 of  each calendar year on or before May 12 of each year, the vessel is  prohibited from fishing for, possessing or landing any regulated  species, ocean pout, or non-exempt species during the period May 12  through May 31, inclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Declaring DAS and blocks of time out. A vessel's owner or  authorized representative shall notify the Regional Administrator of a  vessel's participation in the DAS program; declaration of its 120 days  out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery, if designated as a Day gillnet  category vessel, as specified in paragraph (j) of this section; and  declaration of its 20-day period out of the NE multispecies DAS program,  or, for a sector vessel that the vessel will not fish with gear capable  of catching NE multispecies, using the notification requirements  specified in Sec. 648.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Gillnet restrictions. A vessel issued a limited access NE  multispecies permit may fish under a NE multispecies DAS, under the  provisions of the small vessel permit category, or on a sector trip with  gillnet gear, provided the owner of the vessel obtains an annual  designation as either a Day or Trip gillnet vessel, as described in  Sec. 648.4(c)(2)(iii), and provided the vessel complies with the gillnet  vessel gear requirements and restrictions specified in Sec. 648.80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of  this section. Vessels electing to fish under the Day gillnet designation  must have on board written confirmation, issued by the Regional  Administrator, that the vessel is a Day gillnet vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Removal of gear. All gillnet gear must be brought to port prior  to the vessel fishing in an exempted fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Declaration of time out of the gillnet fishery. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> During each  fishing year, a Day gillnet vessel must declare, and take, a total of  120 days out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery. Each period of time  declared and taken must be a minimum of 7 consecutive days. At least 21  days of this time must be taken between June 1 and September 30 of each  fishing year. The spawning season time out period required by paragraph  (g) of this section shall be credited toward the 120 days time out of  the non-exempt gillnet fishery. If a vessel owner has not declared and  taken any or all of the remaining periods of time required to be out of  the fishery by the last possible date to meet these requirements, the  vessel is prohibited from fishing for, possessing, or landing regulated  multispecies, ocean pout, or non-exempt species harvested with gillnet  gear and from having gillnet gear on board the vessel that is not stowed  and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2 while  fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, the provisions of the small vessel  category permit, or on a sector trip from that date through the end of  the period between June 1 and September 30, or through the end of the  fishing year, as applicable, unless otherwise exempt pursuant to  Sec. 648.87.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any such vessel shall declare its required time periods through  the notification procedures specified in Sec. 648.10(j)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> During each period of time declared out, any such vessel is  prohibited from fishing with non-exempted gillnet gear and must remove  such gear from the water. However, the vessel may fish in an exempted  fishery, as described in Sec. 648.80, or it may fish under a NE  multispecies DAS, under the provisions of the small vessel category  permit, or on a sector trip, provided it fishes with gear other than  non-exempted gillnet gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Method of counting DAS. A Day gillnet vessel fishing with  gillnet gear under a NE multispecies DAS shall accrue DAS as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet gear that has elected  to fish in the Regular B DAS Program, as specified in Sec. 648.85(b)(6),  under a Category B DAS, is subject to the DAS accrual provisions of  paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet gear under a NE  multispecies Category A DAS shall accrue DAS as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Day gillnet vessel on a sector trip is subject to the DAS  accrual provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trip gillnet vessels. When fishing under a NE multispecies DAS,  under the provisions of the small vessel category permit, or on a sector  trip, a Trip gillnet vessel is required to remove all gillnet gear from  the water before returning to port upon the completion of a fishing trip  and calling out of a NE multispecies DAS, as applicable, under  Sec. 648.10(e)(5) or (h)(5), respectively. When not fishing under a NE  multispecies DAS, Trip gillnet vessels may fish in an exempted fishery  with gillnet gear, as authorized by Sec. 648.80.

(1) In addition to the DAS accrual  provisions specified in paragraphs (e) and (n) of this section, and  other measures specified in this part, common pool vessels are subject  to the following restrictions: The Regional Administrator shall project  the catch of regulated species or ocean pout by common pool vessels and  shall determine whether such catch will exceed any of the sub-ACLs  specified for common pool vessels as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(4).  This projection shall include catch by common pool vessels, as well as  available information, regarding the catch of regulated species and  ocean pout by vessels fishing for NE multispecies in State waters  outside of the authority of the FMP, vessels fishing in exempted  fisheries, and vessels fishing in the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. If  it is projected that catch will exceed or under-harvest the common pool  sub-ACL, the Regional Administrator may, at any time during the fishing  year, implement a differential DAS counting factor to all Category A DAS  used within the pertinent stock area(s), as specified in paragraph  (n)(1)(i) of this section, in a manner consistent with the  Administrative Procedure Act. Notwithstanding the fact that the  differential DAS accountability measures described in paragraph (n)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  of this section are intended to address potential over-harvests in  fishing year 2010 and 2011, the scope of the Regional Administrator  authority specified in this paragraph (o) is not limited to FY 2010 and  2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The differential DAS counting factor shall be based on the  projected proportion of the sub-ACL of each NE multispecies stock caught  by common pool vessels, rounded to the nearest even tenth, as specified  in paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section, unless otherwise specified in  Sec. 648.90(a)(5). For example, if the Regional Administrator projects  that common pool vessels will catch 1.18 times the sub-ACL for GOM cod  by the end of fishing year 2010, the Regional Administrator may  implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 to all Category A  DAS used by common pool vessels within the Inshore GOM Differential DAS  Area during fishing year 2010 (i.e., Category A DAS will be charged at a  rate of 28.8 hr for every 24 hr fished--1.2 times 24-hr DAS counting).  If it is projected that catch will simultaneously exceed   or underharvest the sub-ACLs for several regulated species stocks within  a particular stock area, the Regional Administrator may implement the  most restrictive differential DAS counting factor derived from paragraph  (n)(1)(ii) of this section for the sub-ACLs exceeded or underharvested  to any Category A DAS used by common pool vessels within that particular  stock area. For example, if it is projected that the common pool vessel  catch will exceed the GOM cod sub-ACL by a factor of 1.2 and the CC/GOM  yellowtail flounder sub-ACL by a factor of 1.1, the Regional  Administrator may implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 to  any Category A DAS fished by common pool vessels within the Inshore GOM  Differential DAS Area during the fishing year. For any inseason  differential DAS counting factor implemented, the differential DAS  counting factor shall be applied against the DAS accrual provisions  specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section for the time spent  fishing in the applicable differential DAS counting area based upon the  first VMS position into the applicable differential DAS counting area  and the first VMS position outside of the applicable differential DAS  counting area pursuant to Sec. 648.10. For example, if a vessel fished  12 hr inside a differential DAS counting area where a differential DAS  counting factor of 1.2 would be applied, and 12 hr outside of the  differential DAS counting area, the vessel would be charged 48 hr of  DAS, because DAS would be charged in 24-hr increments ((12 hr inside the  area x 1.2 = 14.4 hr) + 12 hr outside the area, rounded to the next 24- hr increment to determine DAS charged).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For any inseason differential DAS counting factor implemented in  fishing year 2011, the inseason differential DAS counting factor shall  be applied in accordance with the DAS accrual provisions specified in  paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, and, if pursuant to paragraph  (n)(1) of this section, in conjunction with a differential DAS counting  factor also implemented for the same differential DAS area during  fishing year 2011 as an AM. For example, if a differential DAS counting  factor of 1.2 was applied to the Inshore GOM Differential DAS Area  during fishing year 2011, as an AM due to a 20-percent overage of the  GOM cod sub-ACL in fishing year 2010, and during fishing year 2011 the  GOM cod sub-ACL was projected to be exceeded by 30 percent, an  additional differential DAS factor of 1.3 would be applied to the DAS  accrual rate as an inseason action during fishing year 2011. Under this  example, the DAS accrual rate after both the AM and the inseason  differential DAS rate is applied to FY 2011 in the Inshore GOM  Differential DAS Counting Area would be 37.4 hr charged for every 24 hr  fished--1.2 x 1.3 x 24-hr DAS charge.
