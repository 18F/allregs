                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maximum practicable utilization of small business, veteran-owned  small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone  small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small  business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter  of national interest with both social and economic benefits. When a  contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a  subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C.  637(d)(4)(F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the  contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of damages attributable to the contractor's failure  to comply shall be an amount equal to the actual dollar amount by which  the contractor failed to achieve each subcontracting goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, at completion of the basic contract or any option, or in the  case of a commercial plan, at the close of the fiscal year for which the  plan is applicable, a contractor has failed to meet its subcontracting  goals, the contracting officer shall review all available information  for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort  to comply with the plan. If no such indication is found, the contracting  officer shall document the file accordingly. If the contracting officer  decides in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection that the  contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its  subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall give the contractor  written notice specifying the failure, advising the contractor of the  possibility that the contractor may have to pay to the Government  liquidated damages, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer  period as necessary) within which to respond. The notice shall give the  contractor an opportunity to demonstrate what good faith efforts have  been made before the contracting officer issues the final decision, and  shall further state that failure of the contractor to respond may be  taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In determining whether a contractor failed to make a good faith  effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, a contracting officer  must look to the totality of the contractor's actions, consistent with  the information and assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the  contractor failed to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in   and of itself, constitute a failure to make a good faith effort. For  example, notwithstanding a contractor's diligent effort to identify and  solicit offers from small business, veteran-owned small business,  service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,  small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business concerns,  factors such as unavailability of anticipated sources or unreasonable  prices may frustrate achievement of the contractor's goals. However,  when considered in the context of the contractor's total effort in  accordance with its plan, the following, though not all inclusive, may  be considered as indicators of a failure to make a good faith effort: a  failure to attempt to identify, contact, solicit, or consider for  contract award small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small  disadvantaged business or women-owned small business concerns; a failure  to designate and maintain a company official to administer the  subcontracting program and monitor and enforce compliance with the plan;  a failure to submit the ISR, or the SSR, using the eSRS, or as provided  in agency regulations; a failure to maintain records or otherwise  demonstrate procedures adopted to comply with the plan; or the adoption  of company policies or procedures that have as their objectives the  frustration of the objectives of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If, after consideration of all the pertinent data, the  contracting officer finds that the contractor failed to make a good  faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting  officer shall issue a final decision to the contractor to that effect  and require the payment of liquidated damages in an amount stated. The  contracting officer's final decision shall state that the contractor has  the right to appeal under the clause in the contract entitled Disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> With respect to commercial plans approved under the clause at  52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer  that approved the plan shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform the functions of the contracting officer under this  subsection on behalf of all agencies with contracts covered by the  commercial plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine whether or not the goals in the commercial plan were  achieved and, if they were not achieved, review all available  information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good  faith effort to comply with the plan, and document the results of the  review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a determination is made to assess liquidated damages, in  order to calculate and assess the amount of damages, the contracting  officer shall ask the contractor to provide--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contract numbers for the Government contracts subject to the  plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total Government sales during the contractor's fiscal year;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of payments made under the Government contracts  subject to that plan that contributed to the contractor's total sales  during the contractor's fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When appropriate, assess liquidated damages on the Government's  behalf, based on the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to  the Government contracts. For example: The contractor's total actual  sales were $50 million and its actual subcontracting was $20 million.  The Government's total payments under contracts subject to the plan  contributing to the contractor's total sales were $5 million, which  accounted for 10 percent of the contractor's total sales. Therefore, the  pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government  contracts would be 10 percent of $20 million, or $2 million. To continue  the example, if the contractor failed to achieve its small business goal  by 1 percent, the liquidated damages would be calculated as 1 percent of  $2 million, or $20,000. The contracting officer shall make similar  calculations for each category of small business where the contractor  failed to achieve its goal and the sum of the dollars for all of the  categories equals the amount of the liquidated damages to be assessed. A  copy of the contracting officer's final decision assessing liquidated  damages shall be provided to other contracting officers with contracts  subject to the commercial plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies  that the Government may have.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Every contracting officer with a contract that is subject to a  commercial plan shall include in the contract file a copy of the  approved plan and a copy of the final decision assessing liquidating  damages, if applicable.
