The FDIC  may remove the notice from expedited processing for any of the reasons  set forth in Sec. 303.11(c)(2). Absent such removal, a notice processed  under expedited processing is deemed approved 30 days after receipt of a  complete notice by the FDIC (subject to extension for an additional 15  days upon written notice to the bank) or on such earlier date authorized  by the FDIC in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> or seeking a waiver  or modification under Sec. 362.18(e) or Sec. 362.18(g)(3) of this  chapter or for notices which are not processed pursuant to the expedited  processing procedures, the FDIC will provide the insured State bank with  written notification of the final action as soon as the decision is  rendered. The FDIC will normally review and act in such cases within 60  days after receipt of a completed application or notice (subject to  extension for an additional 30 days upon written notice to the bank),  but failure of the FDIC to act prior to the expiration of these periods  does not constitute approval.
