                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of notices of insolvency. A plan sponsor that  determines that the plan is, or is expected to be, insolvent for a plan  year shall issue notices of insolvency to the PBGC and to plan  participants and beneficiaries. Once notices of insolvency have been  issued to the PBGC and to plan participants and beneficiaries, no notice  of insolvency needs to be issued for subsequent insolvency years.  Notices shall be delivered in the manner and within the time prescribed  in this section and shall contain the information described in  Sec. 4281.44.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notices of insolvency--when delivered. Except as provided in the  next sentence, the plan sponsor shall mail or otherwise deliver the  notices of insolvency no later than 30 days after the plan sponsor  determines that the plan is or may be insolvent. However, the notice to  plan participants and beneficiaries in pay status may be delivered  concurrently with the first benefit payment made after the determination  of insolvency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notices of insolvency--method of issuance to interested parties.  The PBGC applies the rules in subpart B of part 4000 of this chapter to  determine permissible methods of issuance of the notice of insolvency.  In addition to the methods permitted under subpart B of part 4000, the  plan sponsor may notify   interested parties, other than participants and beneficiaries who are in  pay status when the notice is required to be delivered, by posting the  notice at participants' work sites or publishing the notice in a union  newsletter or in a newspaper of general circulation in the area or areas  where participants reside. Notice to a participant shall be deemed  notice to that participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries.
