The geographic area within normal  commuting distance of the place of the job opportunity for which the  certification is sought. There is no rigid measure of distance that  constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal commuting area,  because there may be widely varying factual circumstances among  different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the  worksite, or quality of the regional transportation network). If the  place of intended employment is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area  (MSA), including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to  be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment.

Any temporary foreign worker who is lawfully present in  the U.S. and authorized by DHS to perform agricultural labor or services  of a temporary or seasonal nature pursuant to 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a).</p><p class="depth0">Job offer.

The following factors, as used under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance  Act, may be considered in determining whether an employer is a successor  in interest; no one factor is dispositive, but all of the circumstances  will be considered as a whole:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substantial continuity of the same business operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of the same facilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continuity of the work force;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Similarity of jobs and working conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Similarity of supervisory personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Whether the former management or owner retains a direct or  indirect interest in the new enterprise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Similarity in machinery, equipment, and production methods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Similarity of products and services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The ability of the predecessor to provide relief.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of debarment only, the primary consideration will be  the personal involvement of the firm's ownership, management,  supervisors, and others associated with the firm in the violations at  issue.</p><p class="depth0">Temporary agricultural labor certification.
