                                Sec. 502.50  What fees does OTS charge?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director assesses fees for examining or investigating savings associations that administer trust assets of $1 billion or less, and saving association affiliates. Because OTS recovers the ordinary costs of examining and investigating savings and loan holding companies through the semi-annual assessment under Sec. Sec. 502.25 through 502.29 of this part, the Director will not generally charge an examination fee to a savings and loan holding company. ``Affiliate'' has the meaning in 12 U.S.C. 1462(9), except that, for this part only, ``affiliate'' does not include any entity that is consolidated with a savings association on the Consolidated Statement of Condition of the Thrift Financial Report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director assesses fees for processing notices, applications, securities filings, and requests, and for providing other services.
