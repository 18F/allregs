                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General content and level of detail. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assessment Plan  must identify and document the use of all of the type A and/or type B  procedures that will be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assessment Plan shall be of sufficient detail to serve as a  means of evaluating whether the approach used for assessing the damage  is likely to be cost-effective and meets the definition of reasonable  cost, as those terms are used in this part. The Assessment Plan shall  include descriptions of the natural resources and the geographical areas  involved. The Assessment Plan shall also include a statement of the  authority for asserting trusteeship, or co-trusteeship, for those  natural resources considered within the Assessment Plan. The authorized  official's statement of the authority for asserting trusteeship shall  not have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption under Sec.  11.91(c) of this part. In addition, for type B assessments, the  Assessment Plan shall include the sampling locations within those  geographical areas, sample and survey design, numbers and types of  samples to be collected, analyses to be performed, preliminary  determination of the recovery period, and   other such information required to perform the selected methodologies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Assessment Plan shall contain information sufficient to  demonstrate that the damage assessment has been coordinated to the  extent possible with any remedial investigation feasibility study or  other investigation performed pursuant to the NCP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Assessment Plan shall contain procedures and schedules for  sharing data, split samples, and results of analyses, when requested,  with any identified potentially responsible parties and other natural  resource trustees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification of types of assessment procedures. The Assessment  Plan must identify whether the authorized official plans to use a type A  procedure, type B procedures, or a combination. Sections 11.34 through  11.36 contain standards for deciding which types of procedures to use.  The Assessment Plan must include a detailed discussion of how these  standards are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specific requirements for type B procedures. If the authorized  official plans to use type B procedures, the Assessment Plan must also  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The results of the confirmation of exposure performed under  Sec. 11.37;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Quality Assurance Plan that satisfies the requirements listed  in the NCP and applicable EPA guidance for quality control and quality  assurance plans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The objectives, as required in Sec. 11.64(a)(2) of this part,  of any testing and sampling for injury or pathway determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan developed in  accordance with the guidance in Sec. 11.81 of this part. If existing  data are not sufficient to develop the Restoration and Compensation  Determination Plan as part of the Assessment Plan, the Restoration and  Compensation Determination Plan may be developed later, after the  completion of the Injury Determination or Quantification phases. If the  Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is published separately,  the public review and comment will be conducted pursuant to Sec.  11.81(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific requirements for type A procedures. If the authorized  official plans to use a type A procedure, the Assessment Plan must also  contain the information described in subpart D.
