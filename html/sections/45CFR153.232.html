                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters. (1) If a State establishes a reinsurance program and elects to collect additional contributions under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or use additional funds for reinsurance payments under Sec. 153.220(d)(2), the State must set supplemental reinsurance payment parameters using one or more of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a State establishes a reinsurance program and elects to collect additional contributions under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or use additional funds for reinsurance payments under Sec. 153.220(d)(2), the State must set supplemental reinsurance payment parameters using one or more of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Decreasing the national attachment point;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Increasing the national reinsurance cap; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Increasing the national coinsurance rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State must ensure that additional reinsurance contributions and

funds projected to be received under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) and Sec. 153.220(d)(2), as applicable, for any applicable benefit year are reasonably calculated to cover additional reinsurance payments that are projected to be made only under the State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters (that will not be paid under the national payment parameters) for the given benefit year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All applicable reinsurance entities in a State collecting additional reinsurance contributions must apply the State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section when calculating reinsurance payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirement for payments under State supplemental reinsurance parameters. Contributions collected under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or funds under Sec. 153.220(d)(2), as applicable, must be applied towards requests for reinsurance payments made under the State supplemental reinsurance payments parameters for each benefit year commencing in 2014 and ending in 2016.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility for reinsurance payments under State supplemental reinsurance parameters. If a State establishes State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters under Sec. 153.232(a)(1), a reinsurance-eligible plan becomes eligible for reinsurance payments from contributions under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or funds under Sec. 153.220(d)(2), as applicable, if its incurred claims costs for an individual enrollee's covered benefits in the applicable benefit year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exceed the State supplemental attachment point set forth in the State notice of benefit and payment parameters for the applicable benefit year if a State has established such a supplemental attachment point under Sec. 153.232(a)(1)(i);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceed the national reinsurance cap set forth in the annual HHS notice of benefit and payment parameters for the applicable benefit year if a State has established a State supplemental reinsurance cap under Sec. 153.232(a)(1)(ii); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceed the national attachment point set forth in the annual HHS notice of benefit and payment parameters for the applicable benefit year if a State has established a supplemental coinsurance rate under Sec. 153.232(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payments under State supplemental reinsurance parameters. Each reinsurance payment made from contributions received under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or funds under Sec. 153.220(d)(2), as applicable, will be calculated with respect to an issuer's incurred claims costs for an individual enrollee's covered benefits in the applicable benefit year as the sum of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the State has established a State supplemental attachment point, to the extent the issuer's incurred claims costs for such benefits in the applicable benefit year exceed the State supplemental attachment point but do not exceed the national attachment point, the product of such claims costs between the State supplemental attachment point and the national attachment point multiplied by the national coinsurance rate (or, if the State has established a State supplemental coinsurance rate, the State supplemental coinsurance rate);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the State has established a State supplemental reinsurance cap, to the extent the issuer's incurred claims costs for such benefits in the applicable benefit year exceed the national reinsurance cap but do not exceed the State supplemental reinsurance cap, the product of such claims costs between the national reinsurance cap and the State supplemental reinsurance cap multiplied by the national coinsurance rate (or, if the State has established a State supplemental coinsurance rate, the State supplemental coinsurance rate); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the State has established a State supplemental coinsurance rate, the product of the issuer's incurred claims costs for such benefits in the applicable benefit year between the national attachment point and the national reinsurance cap multiplied by the difference between the State supplemental coinsurance rate and the national coinsurance rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Uniform adjustment to payments under State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters. If all requested reinsurance payments under the State supplemental reinsurance parameters

calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section from all reinsurance-eligible plans in a State for a benefit year will exceed all reinsurance contributions collected under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) or funds under Sec. 153.220(d)(2) for the applicable benefit year, the State must determine a uniform pro rata adjustment to be applied to all such requests for reinsurance payments. Each applicable reinsurance entity in the State must reduce all such requests for reinsurance payments for the applicable benefit year by that adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Limitations on payments under State supplemental reinsurance parameters. A State must ensure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payments made to issuers must not exceed the issuer's total paid amount for the reinsurance-eligible claim(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any remaining additional funds for reinsurance payments collected under Sec. 153.220(d)(1)(ii) must be used for reinsurance payments under the State supplemental reinsurance payment parameters in subsequent benefit years.
