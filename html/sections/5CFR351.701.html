                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When a group I or II competitive service employee with  a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful  (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive  level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather than furlough or  separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this  section to another competitive position which requires no reduction, or  the lease possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must  be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in  the same competitive area, last at least 3 months, and have the same  type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or  seasonal) as the position from which the employee is released. Upon  accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under  this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new  position. The promotion potential of the offered position is not a  consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lower subgroup--bumping. A released employee shall be assigned  in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and bump to a position  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a  lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or  equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Same subgroup-retreating. A released employee shall be assigned  in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section and retreat to  a position that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is held by another employee with lower retention standing in the  same tenure group and subgroup; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or  equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released,  except that for a preference eligible employee with a compensable  service-connected disability of 30 percent or more the limit is five  grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent). (The agency uses  the grade progression of only the released employee's position of record  to determine the applicable grades (or appropriate grade intervals or  equivalent) of the employee's retreat right. The agency does not  consider the grade progression of the position to which the employee has  a retreat right.); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is the same position, or an essentially identical position,  formerly held by the released employee on a permanent basis as a  competing employee in a Federal agency (i.e., when held by the released  employee in an executive, legislative, or judicial branch agency, the  position would have been placed in tenure groups I, II, or III, or  equivalent). In determining whether a position is essentially identical,  the determination is based on the competitive level criteria found in  Sec. 351.403, but not necessarily in regard to the respective grade,  classification series, type of work schedule, or type of service, of the  two positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation. An employee with a current annual performance rating  of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent may be  assigned under paragraph (c) of this section only to a position held by  another employee with a current annual performance rating of record no  higher than minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pay rates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The determination of equivalent grade intervals  shall be based on a comparison of representative rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each employee's assignment rights shall be determined on the  basis of the pay rates in effect on the date of issuance of specific  reduction-in-force notices, except that when it is officially known on  the date of issuance of notices that new pay rates have been approved  and will become effective by the effective date of the reduction in  force, assignment rights shall be determined on the basis of the new pay  rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining applicable grades (or grade intervals) under  Sec. Sec. 351.701(b)(2) and 351.701(c)(2), the agency uses the grade  progression of the released employee's position of record to determine  the grade (or interval) limits of the employee's assignment rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For positions covered by the General Schedule, the agency must  determine whether a one-grade, two-grade, or mixed grade interval  progression is applicable to the position of the released employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For positions not covered by the General Schedule, the agency  must determine the normal line of progression for each occupational  series and grade level to determine the grade (or interval) limits of  the released employee's assignment rights. If the agency determines that  there is no normal line of progression for an occupational series and  grade level, the agency provides the released employee with assignment  rights to positions within three actual grades lower on a one-grade  basis. The normal line of progression may include positions in different  pay systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For positions where no grade structure exists, the agency  determines a line of progression for each occupation and pay rate, and  provides assignment rights to positions within three grades (or  intervals) lower on that basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the released employee holds a position that is less than  three grades above the lowest grade in the applicable classification  system (e.g., the employee holds a GS-2 position), the agency provides  the released employee with assignment rights up to three actual   grades lower on a one-grade basis in other pay systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a competitive area includes more than one local commuting  area, the agency determines assignment rights under this part on the  basis of the representative rates for one local commuting area within  the competitive area (i.e., the same local commuting area used to  establish competitive levels under Sec. 351.403(c)(4), (5), and (6)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a competitive area includes positions under one or more pay  bands, a released employee shall be assigned in accordance with  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to a position in an  equivalent pay band or one pay band lower, as determined by the agency,  than the pay band from which released. A preference eligible with a  service-connected disability of 30 percent or more must be assigned in  accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to a position  in an equivalent pay band or up to two pay bands lower, as determined by  the agency, than the pay band from which released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If a competitive area includes positions under one or more pay  bands, and other positions not covered by a pay band (e.g., GS and/or  FWS positions), the agency provides assignment rights under this part  by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining the representative rate of positions not covered by  a pay band, consistent with Sec. 351.203;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining the representative rate of each pay band, or  competitive level within the pay band(s), consistent with Sec. 351.203;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As determined by the agency, providing assignment rights under  paragraph (b) of this section (bumping), or paragraphs (c) and (d) of  this section (retreating), consistent with the grade intervals covered  in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section, and the pay band  intervals in paragraph (h) of this section.
