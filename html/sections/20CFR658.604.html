                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State agencies shall compile program performance data required by ETA, including statistical information on program operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ETA shall use the program performance data in assessing and evaluating whether the State agencies have complied with JS regulations and their State agency program budget plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In assessing and evaluating program performance data, the ETA shall act in accordance with the following general principles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fact that the program performance data from a State agency, whether overall or relative to a particular program activity, indicate poor program performance does not by itself constitute a violation of JS regulations or of the State agency's responsibilities under its State agency program budget plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Program performance data, however, may so strongly indicate that a State agency's performance is poor that the data may raise a presumption (prima facie case) that a State agency is violating JS regulations or the State agency program budget plan. A State agency's failure to meet the operational objectives set forth in the PBP shall raise a presumption that the agency is violating JS regulations and/or its PBP. In such cases the ETA shall afford the State agency an opportunity to rebut the presumption of a violation pursuant to the procedures at subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ETA shall take into account that certain program performance data may measure items over which State agencies have direct or substantial control while other data may measure items over which the State agency has indirect or minimal control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Generally, for example, a State agency has direct and substantial control over the delivery of job services such as referrals to jobs, job development contacts, applicant counseling, referrals to supportive services and the conduct of field checks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies, however, have only indirect control over the outcome of services. State agencies, for example, cannot guarantee that an employer will hire a referred applicant, nor can they guarantee that the terms and conditions of employment will be as stated on a job order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Outside forces, moreover, such as a sudden heavy increase in unemployment rates, a strike by State agency employees, or a severe drought or flood may skew the results measured by program performance data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ETA shall consider a State agency's failure to keep accurate and complete program performance data required by JS regulations as a violation of the JS regulations.</p>
