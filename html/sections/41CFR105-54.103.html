Making policy decisions and determining action to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and obtain

the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by GSA of its assigned functions.</p>
