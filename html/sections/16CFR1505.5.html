(1) Switches and other control devices of electrically operated toys shall be suitable for the application and shall have a rating not less than that of the load they control (see Sec. 1505.6(e)(5)(ii) regarding electrical switch overload). A switch that controls a replaceable incandescent lamp, electrode, or lampholder contact which is at a potential of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) to any other part or to ground shall open both sides of the circuit and shall have a marked ``OFF'' position. A switch that may reasonably be expected to be subjected to temperatures higher than 50 [deg]C. (122 [deg]F.) shall be constructed of materials which are suitable for use at such temperatures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Switches and other control devices of electrically operated toys shall be suitable for the application and shall have a rating not less than that of the load they control (see Sec. 1505.6(e)(5)(ii) regarding electrical switch overload).

Such door(s) or cover(s) of the enclosure shall be so designed and constructed that they cannot be opened manually or with a flat bladed screwdriver or pliers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With all access doors and covers closed, the lamp enclosure shall have no opening that will permit entry of a straight rod 6 inches long and one-fourth inch in diameter if such entry would present an electrical hazard. The lamp shall be located no less than one-half inch from any \1/4\-inch-diameter opening in the enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A toy having one or more lampholders shall be designed and constructed so that no live parts other than the contacts of the lampholders are exposed to contact by persons removing or replacing lamps. The shells of all lampholders for incandescent lamps shall be at the same potential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the potential between the contacts of a lampholder for a replaceable

incandescent lamp and any other part or ground is greater than 30 volts r.m.s.
