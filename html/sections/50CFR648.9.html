                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval. The type-approval requirements for VMS MTUs and MCSPs  for the Greater Atlantic Region are those as published by the NMFS  Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) in the Federal Register, and are  available upon request. Both the national type-approval requirements at  50 CFR part 600, subpart Q and any established regional standards must  be met in order to receive approval for use in the Greater Atlantic  Region. The NMFS OLE Director shall approve all MTUs, MCSPs, and bundles  including those operating in the Greater Atlantic Region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maintenance. Once approved, VMS units must maintain the minimum  standards for which they were approved in the type approval  requirements. Any changes made to the original submission for approval  of an MTU or MCSP by NMFS must follow the procedures outlined in the  type approval requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. A list of approved VMS vendors will be published  on the Northeast Regional Office Web site and in each proposed and final  rule for implementing or modifying VMS requirements for specific  fisheries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revocations. Revocation procedures for type-approvals are at 50  CFR 600.1514. In the event of a revocation,   NMFS will provide information to affected vessel owners as explained at  50 CFR 600.1516. In these instances, vessel owners may be eligible for  the reimbursement of the cost of a new type-approved EMTU should funding  for reimbursement be available.
