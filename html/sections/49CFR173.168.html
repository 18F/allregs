                            <p class="depth0">An oxygen generator, chemical (defined in Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) may be transported only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval. A chemical oxygen generator that is shipped with an explosive or non-explosive means of initiation attached must be classed and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 173.56 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Impact resistance. A chemical oxygen generator, without any packaging, must be capable of withstanding a 1.8

meter drop onto a rigid, non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface, in the position most likely to cause actuation or loss of contents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection against inadvertent actuation. A chemical oxygen generator must incorporate one of the following means of preventing inadvertent actuation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A chemical oxygen generator that is not installed in protective breathing equipment (PBE):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mechanically actuated devices:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Two pins, installed so that each is independently capable of preventing the actuator from striking the primer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> One pin and one retaining ring, each installed so that each is independently capable of preventing the actuator from striking the primer; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A cover securely installed over the primer and a pin installed so as to prevent the actuator from striking the primer and cover.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Electrically actuated devices: The electrical leads must be mechanically shorted and the mechanical short must be shielded in metal foil.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Devices with a primer but no actuator: A chemical oxygen generator that has a primer but no actuating mechanism must have a protective cover over the primer to prevent actuation from external impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A chemical oxygen generator installed in a PBE must contain a pin installed so as to prevent the actuator from striking the primer, and be placed in a protective bag, pouch, case or cover such that the protective breathing equipment is fully enclosed in such a manner that the protective bag, pouch, case or cover prevents unintentional actuation of the oxygen generator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Packaging. A chemical oxygen generator and a chemical oxygen generator installed in equipment, (e.g., a PBE) must be placed in a rigid outer packaging that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conforms to the requirements of either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Part 178, subparts L and M, of this subchapter at the Packing Group I or II performance level; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The performance criteria in Air Transport Association (ATA) Specification No. 300 for a Category I Shipping Container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With its contents, is capable of meeting the following additional requirements when transported by cargo-only aircraft:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Flame Penetration Resistance Test specified in appendix E to part 178 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Thermal Resistance Test specified in appendix D to part 178 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equipment marking. The outside surface of a chemical oxygen generator must be marked to indicate the presence of an oxygen generator (e.g., ``oxygen generator, chemical''). The outside surface of equipment containing a chemical oxygen generator that is not readily apparent (e.g., a sealed passenger service unit) must be clearly marked to indicate the presence of the oxygen generator (example: ``Oxygen Generator Inside'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Items forbidden in air transportation. (1) A chemical oxygen generator is forbidden for transportation on board a passenger-carrying aircraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A chemical oxygen generator is forbidden for transportation on board a passenger-carrying aircraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A chemical oxygen generator is forbidden for transportation by both passenger-carrying and cargo-only aircraft after:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer's expiration date; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contents of the generator have been expended.
