Final issuance of the standardized permit constitutes approval of the closure plan, and the plan becomes a condition of the RCRA standardized permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director's approval of the plan must ensure that the approved plan is consistent with Sec. Sec.  267.111 through 267.115, 267.176, 267.201, and 267.1108.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Satisfy the requirements for content of closure plan.

These might include procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance standard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that partial or final closure satisfies the closure performance standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A schedule for closure of each hazardous waste management unit, and for

The Director will approve, disapprove, or modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 124.211 and 270.320.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification before final closure. (1) You must notify the Director in writing at least 45 days before the date that you expect to begin final closure of a treatment or storage tank, container storage area, or containment building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must notify the Director in writing at least 45 days before the date that you expect to begin final closure of a treatment or storage tank, container storage area, or containment building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date when you ``expect to begin closure'' must be no later than 30 days after the date that any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of hazardous wastes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your facility's permit is terminated, or if you are otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order under section 3008 of RCRA, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then the requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply. However, you must close the facility following the deadlines established in Sec.  267.115.</p>
