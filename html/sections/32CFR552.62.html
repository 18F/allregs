                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of the Army expects that commercial enterprises soliciting military personnel through advertisements appearing in unofficial military publications will voluntarily observe the highest business ethics in describing both the goods, services, and commodities and the terms of the sale (such as guarantees and warranties). If not, the publisher of the military publication will request the advertiser to observe them. The advertising of credit will conform to the provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act, as implemented by Regulation Z, published by the Federal Reserve Board (12 CFR part 226).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commanders will provide appropriate information and educational programs to provide members of the Army with information pertaining to the conduct of their personal commercial affairs (e.g., the protections and remedies offered consumers under the Truth-in-Lending Act, insurance, Government benefits, savings, estate planning, and budgeting). The services or representatives of credit unions, banks, and nonprofit military associations approved by HQDA may be used for this purpose provided their programs are entirely educational. Under no circumstances will the services of commercial agents, including loan or finance companies and their associations, be used for this purpose. Educational materials prepared or used by outside organizations or experts in this field may be adapted or used with applicable permission, provided the material is entirely educational and does not contain applications or contract forms.


Sec. 552.63  ``Cooling off'' period for door-to-door sales.</p><p class="depth2">The Federal Trade Commission Rule, 16 CFR part 429, p. 233, effective 7 June 1974, pertains to a cooling off period for door-to-door sales. The rule applies to any sale, lease, or rental of consumer goods or services with a purchase price of $25 or more, whether under single or multiple contracts, in which the seller or business representative personally solicits the sale, including those in response to or following an invitation by the buyer, and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is made at a place other than the place of business of the seller. The purpose of the law is to allow the consumer the right to cancel a transaction at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of the transaction. When any door-to-door sale or transaction takes place anywhere on or off the installation (other than the seller's place of business) the consumer must be provided with a full and complete receipt or copy of a contract pertaining to the sale at the time of its execution which shall include the ``cancellation statements'' as required by the FTC rule.</p>
