                                Sec. 120.214  What conditions apply for variable interest rates?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A Lender may use a variable rate of interest, upon SBA's approval.  SBA's maximum allowable rates apply only to the initial rate on the date  SBA received the loan application. SBA shall approve the use of a  variable interest rate under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Frequency. The first change may occur on the first calendar day  of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate (see  paragraph (c) of this section) in effect on the first business day of  the month. After that, changes may occur no more often than monthly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Range of fluctuation. The amount of fluctuation shall be equal  to the movement in the base rate. The difference between the initial  rate and the ceiling rate may be no greater than the difference between  the initial rate and the floor rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Base rate. The base rate will be one of the following: (i) The  prime rate; (ii) the thirty-day (1-month) London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR) plus 3 percentage points, or (iii) the Optional Peg Rate. The  prime or LIBOR rate will be that which is in effect on the first  business day of the month, as printed in a national financial newspaper  published each business day. SBA publishes the Optional Peg Rate  quarterly in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maturities under 7 years. For loans with maturities under seven  years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and one-quarter (2  1/4) percentage points over the base rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maturities of 7 years or more. For loans with maturities of  seven or more years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and  three-quarters (2 3/4) percentage points over the base rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amortization. Initial amortization of principal and interest may  be recomputed and reassessed as interest rates fluctuate, as directed by  SBA. With prior approval of SBA, the Lender may use certain other  amortization methods, except that SBA does not allow balloon payments.
