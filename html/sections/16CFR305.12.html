                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Layout. All energy labels for central air conditioners, heat pumps, and

furnaces (including boilers) shall use one size, similar colors, and typefaces with consistent positioning of headline, copy, and charts to maintain uniformity for immediate consumer recognition and readability. Trim size dimensions for all labels shall be as follows: width must be between 5\1/4\ inches and 5\1/2\ inches (13.34 cm. and 13.97 cm.); length must be between 7\3/8\ inches (18.78 cm.) and 7\5/8\ (19.34 cm.). Copy is to be set between 27 picas and 29 picas and copy page should be centered (right to left and top to bottom). Depth is variable but should follow closely the prototype labels appearing at the end of this part illustrating the basic layout. All positioning, spacing, type sizes, and line widths should be similar to and consistent with the prototype and sample labels in appendix L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Type style and setting. The Arial series typeface or equivalent shall be used exclusively on the label. Specific sizes and faces to be used are indicated on the prototype labels. No hyphenation should be used in setting headline or copy text. Positioning and spacing should follow the prototypes closely. Generally, text must be set flush left with two points leading except where otherwise indicated. See the prototype labels for specific directions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Colors. The basic colors of all labels covered by this section shall be process yellow or equivalent and process black. The label shall be printed full bleed process yellow. All type and graphics shall be print process black.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Label type. The labels must be affixed in the form of an adhesive label, unless otherwise indicated by this section. All adhesive labels should be applied with an adhesive with an adhesion capacity sufficient to prevent their dislodgment during normal handling throughout the chain of distribution to the retailer or consumer. The paper stock for pressure-sensitive or other adhesive labels shall have a basic weight of not less than 58 pounds per 500 sheets (25''x38'') or equivalent, exclusive of the release liner and adhesive. A minimum peel adhesion capacity for the adhesive of 12 ounces per square inch is suggested, but not required if the adhesive can otherwise meet the above standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Placement. (1) Manufacturers shall affix adhesive labels to the covered products in such a position that they are easily read by persons examining the products. The labels should be generally located on the upper-right-front corner of each product's front exterior. However, other prominent locations may be used as long as labels will not become dislodged during normal handling throughout the chain of distribution to retailers or consumers. Tops of the labels should not exceed 74 inches from the base of taller products. Labels can be displayed in the form of a flap tag adhered to the top of the appliance and bent (folded at 90[deg]) to hang over the front, as long as this can be done with assurance that it will be readily visible. Labels for split-system central air conditioners should be affixed to the condensing unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraph (e)(1), for split-system and single-package central air conditioners, and all non-weatherized and mobile home furnaces manufactured on or after the compliance date of regional efficiency standards issued by the Department of Energy for those products in 10 CFR part 430, manufacturers shall affix labels to covered product packages or the products themselves in positions that allow persons examining the packaged products to read the labels easily. Labels on packaging must be affixed via adhesive or another means sufficient to prevent their dislodgment during normal handling throughout the chain of distribution to the retailer or consumer. Labels for split-system central air conditioners should be affixed to condensing units' packages or condensing units consistent with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Content of furnace labels: Content of labels for non-weatherized furnaces, weatherized furnaces, mobile home furnaces, electric furnaces, and boilers. (1) Headlines and texts, as illustrated in the prototype and sample labels in appendix L to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Name of manufacturer or private labeler shall, in the case of a corporation, be deemed to be satisfied only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of

the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The model's basic model number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The model's capacity.

The logo must be no larger than 1 inch by 3 inches in size. Only manufacturers that have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy or the Environmental Protection Agency may add the ENERGY STAR logo to labels on qualifying covered products; such manufacturers may add the ENERGY STAR logo to labels only on those covered products that are contemplated by the Memorandum of Understanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Manufacturers of boilers shipped with more than one input nozzle to be installed in the field must label such boilers with the AFUE of the system when it is set up with the nozzle that results in the lowest AFUE rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Manufacturers that ship out boilers that may be set up as either steam or hot water units must label the boilers with the AFUE rating derived by conducting the required test on the boiler as a hot water unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Manufacturers of oil furnaces must label their products with the AFUE rating associated with the furnace's input capacity set by the manufacturer at shipment. The oil furnace label may also contain a chart, as illustrated in sample label 9B in appendix L to this part, indicating the efficiency rating at up to three additional input capacities offered by the manufacturer. Consistent with paragraph (f)(10)(iii) of this section, labels for oil furnaces may include the ENERGY STAR logo only if the model qualifies for that program on all input capacities displayed on the label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Content of central air conditioner labels: Content of labels for central air conditioners and heat pumps. (1) Headlines and texts, as illustrated in the prototype and sample labels in appendix L to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Name of manufacturer or private labeler shall, in the case of a corporation, be deemed to be satisfied only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation.

For the heating function, the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) shall be calculated for heating Region IV for the standardized design heating requirement nearest the capacity measured in the High Temperature Test in accordance with Sec. 305.5. In addition, as illustrated in the sample labels 7 and 8 in appendix L to this part, the ratings for any split-system condenser-evaporator coil combinations shall include the low and high ratings of all condenser-evaporator coil combinations certified to the Department of Energy pursuant to 10 CFR part 430.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(i)</em> Each cooling-only central air conditioner label shall contain a range of comparability consisting of the lowest and highest SEER for all cooling only central air conditioners consistent with sample label 7A in appendix L to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each cooling-only central air conditioner label shall contain a range of comparability consisting of the lowest and highest SEER for all cooling only central air conditioners consistent with sample label 7A in appendix L to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each heat pump label, except as noted in paragraph (g)(6)(iii) of this section, shall contain two ranges of comparability.
