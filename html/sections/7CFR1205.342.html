                            <p class="depth0">Any importer organization may request the Secretary for  certification of eligibility to participate in nominating members and  alternate members to represent cotton importers on the Cotton Board.  Such eligibility shall be based, in addition to other available  information, upon a factual report submitted by the organization which  shall contain information deemed relevant and specified by the Secretary  for the making of such determination, including the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nature and size of organization's active membership, proportion  of total active membership accounted for by cotton importers and the  total amount of cotton imported by the organization's cotton importer  members;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The extent to which the cotton importer membership of such  organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence of stability and permanency of the organization;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sources from which the organization's operating funds are  derived;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Functions of the organization; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The organization's ability and willingness to further the aims  and objectives of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an  organization shall be whether its membership consist of a sufficient  large number of cotton importers who import a relatively significant  volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in the  nomination of members for the Cotton Board. Any importer organization  found eligible by the Secretary under this Sec. 1205.342 will be  certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary's determination as to  eligibility is final.
