Each applicant for or recipient of  certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility  operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without  charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement  Officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the  applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to  domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not  attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local  law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to what is  necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no  informed judgment that a vehicle is certifiable or is covered by a  certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the  responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and  manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not  arise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Presentation of credentials'' shall mean display of the  document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where vehicle, component, or engine storage areas or facilities  are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all times during which  personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of  the area or facility and have access to it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph  (g)(2) of this section are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all  times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during  which testing, maintenance, mileage (or service) accumulation,  production or compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity  related to certification testing, to translation of designs from the  test stage to the production stage, or to vehicle (or engine)  manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical,  copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available  upon request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their  working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized  representative of how the facility operates and to answer his questions,  and the performance on request of emissions tests on any vehicle which  is being, has been, or will be used for certification or in-use  verification or confirmatory testing. Such tests shall be  nondestructive, but may require appropriate mileage (or service)  accumulation. A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal  appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement  Officer or EPA authorized representative by written request for his  appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation  or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance,  served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by  the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied,  represented, and advised by counsel.</p>
