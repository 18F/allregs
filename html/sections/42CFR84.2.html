weighted network of a standard sound level meter using slow response.</p><p class="depth0">Dust means a solid mechanically produced particle with a size ranging from submicroscopic to macroscopic.</p><p class="depth0">A facepiece or mouthpiece is a respirator component designed to provide a gas-tight or dust-tight fit with the face and may include headbands, valves, and connections for canisters, cartridges, filters, or respirable gas source.</p><p class="depth0">Final inspection means that activity carried out on a product after all manufacturing and assembly operations are completed to insure completeness and adherence to performance or other specifications, including satisfactory appearance.</p><p class="depth0">Fume means a solid condensation particle, generally less than 1 micrometer in diameter.</p><p class="depth0">Gas means an aeriform fluid which is in a gaseous state at ordinary temperature and pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous atmosphere means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any atmosphere containing a toxic or disease producing gas, vapor, dust, fume, mist, or pesticide, either immediately or not immediately dangerous to life or health; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any oxygen-deficient atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2">A hood or helmet is a respirator component which covers the wearer's head and neck, or head, neck, and shoulders, and is supplied with incoming respirable air for the wearer to breathe. It may include a headharness and connection for a breathing tube.</p><p class="depth2">Immediately dangerous to life or health means conditions that pose an immediate threat to life or health or conditions that pose an immediate threat of severe exposure to contaminants, such as radioactive materials, which are likely to have adverse cumulative or delayed effects on health.</p><p class="depth2">Incoming inspection means the activity of receiving, examining, and accepting only those materials and parts whose quality conforms to specification requirements.</p><p class="depth2">In-process inspection means the control of products at the source of production and at each step of the manufacturing process, so that departures from specifications can be corrected before defective components or materials are assembled into the finished product.</p><p class="depth2">Institute or NIOSH means the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="depth2">Liquefied-breathing gas means oxygen or air stored in liquid form and supplied to the wearer in a gaseous form.</p><p class="depth2">Mist means a liquid condensation particle with a size ranging from submicroscopic to macroscopic.</p><p class="depth2">MSHA means the Mine Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth2">National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) means the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, P.O.
