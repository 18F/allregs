                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All overhead construction costs, such as engineering,  supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction  engineering and supervision by others than the service company, law  expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes  and interest, must be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis  of the amounts of the reasonably applicable overheads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As far as practicable, the determination of payroll charges  includible in construction overheads must be based on the related time  card distributions. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies  must be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted  to construction activities to the end that only the overhead costs that  have a definite relation to construction must be capitalized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The records supporting the entries for overhead construction  costs must be kept so as to show the total amount of each overhead for  each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to  each construction project and to each property account, and the bases of  distribution of such costs.</p>
