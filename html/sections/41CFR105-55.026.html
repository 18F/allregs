                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 105-55.027 and 105-55.028  apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant  to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other  amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest,  penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of  partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to  the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation, the General Services  Administration (GSA) may suspend or terminate collection under this part  with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or  transferred for collection services to, the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or  collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such  other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest,  penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or  terminate rests solely with DOJ. If GSA believes suspension or  termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the  Agency will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate  litigating division in DOJ, using the Claims Collection Litigation  Report. The referral will specify the reasons for the Agency's  recommendation. If, prior to referral to DOJ, GSA determines a debt is  plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the Agency may  terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without  obtaining DOJ concurrence.</p>
