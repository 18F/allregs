                                Sec. 4279.256  Construction planning and performing development.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The lender must comply with Sec. 4279.156(a) through (c), except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Architectural and engineering practices. Under paragraph Sec. 4279.156(a), the lender must also ensure that all project facilities are designed utilizing accepted architectural and engineering practices that conform to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Onsite inspector. The lender must provide an onsite project inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Changes and cost overruns. The borrower shall be responsible for any changes or cost overruns. If any such change or cost overrun occurs, then any change order must be expressly approved by the Agency, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and neither the lender nor borrower will divert funds from purposes identified in the guaranteed loan application approved by the Agency to pay for any such change or cost overrun without the express written approval of the Agency. In no event will the current loan be modified or a subsequent guaranteed loan be approved to cover any such changes or costs. In the event of any of the aforementioned increases in cost or expenses, the borrower must provide for such increases in a manner that does not diminish the borrower's operating capital. Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph will be considered a material adverse change in the borrower's financial condition, and the lender must address this matter, in writing, to the Agency's satisfaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New draw certifications. The following three certifications are required for each new draw:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification by the project engineer to the lender that the work referred to in the draw has been successfully completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification from the lender that all debts have been paid and all mechanics' liens have been waived; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification from the lender that the borrower is complying with the Davis-Bacon Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Surety. Surety, as the term is commonly used in the industry, will be required in cases when the guarantee will be issued prior to completion of construction unless the contractor will receive a lump sum payment at the end of work. Surety will be made a part of the contract if the borrower requests it or if the contractor requests partial payments for construction work. In such cases where no surety is provided

and the project involves pre-commercial technology, technology that is first of its type in the U.S., or new designs without sufficient operating hours to prove their merit, a latent defects bond may be required by the Agency to cover the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting during construction. During the construction of the project, lenders shall submit quarterly construction progress reports to the Agency. These reports must contain, at a minimum, planned and completed construction milestones, loan advances, and personnel hiring, training, and retention. This requirement applies to both the development and construction of commercial-scale biorefineries and to the retrofitting of existing facilities using eligible technology for the development of advanced biofuels. The lender must expeditiously report any problems in project development to the Agency.
