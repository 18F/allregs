                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to April 1, 2003, contributions to the universal service support mechanisms shall be based on contributors' end-user telecommunications revenues and on a contribution factor determined quarterly by the Commission. Contributions to the mechanisms beginning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors' projected collected end-user telecommunications revenues, and on a contribution factor determined quarterly by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For funding the federal universal service support mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contributors' interstate and international revenues derived from domestic end users for telecommunications or telecommunications services, net of prior period actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contributors' projected collected interstate and international revenues derived from domestic end users for telecommunications or telecommunications services, net of projected contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal service contribution factor shall be determined by the Commission based on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses of the universal service support mechanisms to the total end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues, net of prior period actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal service contribution factor shall be determined by the Commission based on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses of the universal service support mechanisms to the total projected collected end-user

interstate and international telecommunications revenues, net of projected contributions. The Commission shall approve the Administrator's quarterly projected costs of the universal service support mechanisms, taking into account demand for support and administrative expenses. The total subject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator based on information contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets described in Sec. 54.711(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Total projected expenses for the federal universal service support mechanisms for each quarter must be approved by the Commission before they are used to calculate the quarterly contribution factor and individual contributions. For each quarter, the Administrator must submit its projections of demand for the federal universal service support mechanisms for high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, and the basis for those projections, to the Commission and the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. For each quarter, the Administrator must submit its projections of administrative expenses for the high-cost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the schools and libraries mechanism and the rural health care mechanism and the basis for those projections to the Commission and the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Administrator on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets, the Administrator must submit the total contribution base to the Office of the Managing Director at least thirty (30) days before the start of each quarter. The projections of demand and administrative expenses and the contribution factor shall be announced by the Commission in a public notice and shall be made available on the Commission's website. The Commission reserves the right to set projections of demand and administrative expenses at amounts that the Commission determines will serve the public interest at any time within the fourteen-day period following release of the Commission's public notice. If the Commission take no action within fourteen (14) days of the date of release of the public notice announcing the projections of demand and administrative expenses, the projections of demand and administrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be deemed approved by the Commission. Except as provided in Sec. 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the quarterly contribution factor, once approved by the Commission, to contributor's interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues to calculate the amount of individual contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the contributions received by the Administrator in a quarter exceed the amount of universal service support program contributions and administrative costs for that quarter, the excess payments will be carried forward to the following quarter. The contribution factors for the following quarter will take into consideration the projected costs of the support mechanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions carried over from the previous quarter. The Commission may instruct the Administrator to treat excess contributions in a manner other than as prescribed in this paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in the form of a Commission Order or a public notice released by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such public notice will become effective fourteen days after release of the public notice, absent further Commission action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the contributions received by the Administrator in a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of universal service support program payments and administrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator shall request authority from the Commission to borrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by future contributions. Subsequent contribution factors will take into consideration the projected costs of the support mechanisms and the additional costs associated with borrowing funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, the Administrator shall bill that contributor based on whatever relevant data the Administrator has available,

including, but not limited to, the number of lines presubscribed to the contributor and data from previous years, taking into consideration any estimated changes in such data.
