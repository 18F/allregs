Checks will be mailed to the payee at the address indicated on the  voucher application, unless subsequent to the issue of the voucher  application the Treasury Department receives a written request from the  payee to deliver the check to him at some other address. Where the award  has been entered in favor of more than one person, only one check will  be drawn in making payment unless the payees specify the share of each  and request separate checks.
