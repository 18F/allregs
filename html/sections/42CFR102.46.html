                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. All requesters may amend their documentation concerning eligibility until the Secretary has made an eligibility determination. Requesters also may amend their information or documentation concerning the calculation of benefits until the Secretary has made a benefits determination. The Secretary may, at his discretion, accept eligibility or benefits documents even after eligibility or benefits determinations have been made (e.g., the Secretary may accept new documents concerning eligibility after determining that a requester is ineligible and may use such documents to reevaluate the earlier eligibility determination). However, such new documentation will not be used in any reconsideration regarding the initial determination. The Secretary will not consider any documentation submitted after the Program terminates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requesters who are survivors. If a smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but subsequently dies, his or her survivor(s) may amend his or her Request Package at any time before the Program terminates in order to be considered eligible for death benefits. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits with respect to the deceased person's Request Package. However, a survivor filing an amendment to a previously filed Request Package may only be entitled to benefits if the previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing filing deadline. All documentation that has already been submitted with respect to the deceased person will be considered part of the survivor requester's Request Package, and he or she is not required to resubmit such documentation. Survivor requesters must also file an amendment to a Request Package if there is a change in the order of priority of survivors, as described in Sec.  102.11. Such an amendment may be filed at any time before the Program terminates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests in which benefits are sought by the estate of a deceased smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact. If a smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but subsequently dies, a representative of his or her estate may amend his or her Request Package at any time before the Program terminates in order to be considered eligible for benefits. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits with respect to the deceased person's Request Package. However, a representative of an estate filing an amendment to a previously filed Request Package may only be entitled to benefits if the previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing filing deadline. All required documentation that has already been submitted with respect to the deceased person will be considered part of the amended Request Package, and the representative of the estate is not required to resubmit such documentation.</p>
