                                Sec. 246.202  Corrugated container recovery.

Sec. 246.202-1  Requirement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any commercial establishment generating 10 or more tons of waste corrugated containers per month shall separately collect and sell this material for the purpose of recycling.


Sec. 246.202-2  Recommended procedures: Corrugated container recoveryfrom smaller commercial facilities.</p><p class="depth0">The recovery of corrugated containers from commercial facilities generating less than 10 tons per month should be investigated in conformance with the following recommended procedures and implemented where feasible.


Sec. 246.202-3  Recommended procedures: Market study.</p><p class="depth0">An investigation of markets should be made by the organization responsible for sale of recyclable material in each Federal agency and should include at a minimum:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identifying potential purchasers of the recovered corrugated through standard market research techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directly contacting buyers and determining the buyers' quality specifications, potential transportation agreements and any minimum quantity criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining the price that the buyer will pay for the recovered corrugated and the willingness of the buyer to sign a contract for purchase of the paper at a guaranteed minimum price.


Sec. 246.202-4  Recommended procedures: Methods of separation and storage.</p><p class="depth0">The method selected will depend upon such variables as the physical layout of the individual generating facility, the rate at which the corrugated accumulates, the storage capacity of the facility, and the projected cost-effectiveness of using the various methods. All of the following suggested modes of separation and storage presuppose that the corrugated boxes will be accumulated at a central location in the facility after their contents are removed and that the boxes are flattened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Balers of various sizes: Corrugated boxes are placed in balers and compacted into bales. These bales may be stored inside or outside of the facility. The bales should be protected from fire, inclement weather, theft, and vandalism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stationary compactors or bulk containers: Corrugated boxes are placed in a stationary compactor or bulk containers outside of the facility. The containers should be protected from fire, inclement weather, theft and vandalism.


Sec. 246.202-5  Recommended procedures: Transportation.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation to market may be supplied by either the facility, a private hauler or the purchaser. In facilities to which goods are delivered from a central warehouse, corrugated may be backhauled by delivery trucks to the central facility and baled there for delivery to a user.


Sec. 246.202-6  Recommended procedures: Cost analysis.</p><p class="depth2">After potential markets have been identified (but prior to initiation of formal bidding), preliminary determinations of various separation methods, storage and transportation costs have been made, and estimated tonnages of both recoverable material and

residual solid waste have been established, an analysis should be conducted which compares the costs of the present waste collection and disposal system with the proposed segregated systems. At a minimum, the study should include all capital, operating and overhead costs and take into account credits for revenue from paper sales and savings from diverting recycled materials from disposal. Potential costs to upgrade collection and disposal practices to comply with EPA's Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Wastes (40 CFR part 243) and Thermal Processing and Land Disposal Guidelines (40 CFR parts 240 and 241) should be included in the analysis. This cost analysis should enable the facility to determine the most cost effective method of implementing these guidelines.


Sec. 246.202-7  Recommended procedures: Establishment of purchase contract.</p><p class="depth2">Formal bids should be requested for purchase of the recovered materials, such bids being solicited in con formance with bidding procedures established for the responsible agency. Contracts should include the buyer's quality specifications, transportation agreements, a guarantee that the material will be accepted for one year or more and a guaranteed minimum purchase price.</p>
