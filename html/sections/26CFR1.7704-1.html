                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Publicly traded partnership. A domestic or  foreign partnership is a publicly traded partnership for purposes of  section 7704(b) and this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interests in the partnership are traded on an established  securities market; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a  secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partnership interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, an interest in a partnership includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any interest in the capital or profits of the partnership  (including the right to partnership distributions); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any financial instrument or contract the value of which is  determined in whole or in part by reference to the partnership  (including the amount of partnership distributions, the value of  partnership assets, or the results of partnership operations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for non-convertible debt. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, an interest in a partnership does not include  any financial instrument or contract that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is treated as debt for federal tax purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is not convertible into or exchangeable for an interest in the  capital or profits of the partnership and does not provide for a payment  of equivalent value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception for tiered entities. For purposes of section 7704(b)  and this section, an interest in a partnership or a corporation  (including a regulated investment company as defined in section 851 or a  real estate investment trust as defined in section 856) that holds an  interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) is not considered an  interest in the lower-tier partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of transfer. For purposes of section 7704(b) and this  section, a transfer of an interest in a partnership means a transfer in  any form, including a redemption by the partnership or the entering into  of a financial instrument or contract described in paragraph  (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>  and this section, an established securities market includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A national securities exchange exempt from registration under  section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) because  of the limited volume of transactions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A foreign securities exchange that, under the law of the  jurisdiction where it is organized, satisfies regulatory requirements  that are analogous   to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section (such as the  London International Financial Futures Exchange; the Marche a Terme  International de France; the International Stock Exchange of the United  Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Limited; the Frankfurt Stock  Exchange; and the Tokyo Stock Exchange);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A regional or local exchange; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm  buy or sell quotations by identified brokers or dealers by electronic  means or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial  equivalent thereof--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7704(b) and  this section, interests in a partnership that are not traded on an  established securities market (within the meaning of section 7704(b) and  paragraph (b) of this section) are readily tradable on a secondary  market or the substantial equivalent thereof if, taking into account all  of the facts and circumstances, the partners are readily able to buy,  sell, or exchange their partnership interests in a manner that is  comparable, economically, to trading on an established securities  market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. For  purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, interests in a partnership  are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent  thereof if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interests in the partnership are regularly quoted by any person,  such as a broker or dealer, making a market in the interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any person regularly makes available to the public (including  customers or subscribers) bid or offer quotes with respect to interests  in the partnership and stands ready to effect buy or sell transactions  at the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The holder of an interest in the partnership has a readily  available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange the  interest through a public means of obtaining or providing information of  offers to buy, sell, or exchange interests in the partnership; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Prospective buyers and sellers otherwise have the opportunity  to buy, sell, or exchange interests in the partnership in a time frame  and with the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that  described in the other provisions of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Secondary market safe harbors. The fact that a transfer of a  partnership interest is not within one or more of the safe harbors  described in paragraph (e), (f), (g), (h), or (j) of this section is  disregarded in determining whether interests in the partnership are  readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent  thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Involvement of the partnership required. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, interests in a partnership are not traded on  an established securities market within the meaning of paragraph (b)(5)  of this section and are not readily tradable on a secondary market or  the substantial equivalent thereof within the meaning of paragraph (c)  of this section (even if interests in the partnership are traded or  readily tradable in a manner described in paragraph (b)(5) or (c) of  this section) unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The partnership participates in the establishment of the market  or the inclusion of its interests thereon; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The partnership recognizes any transfers made on the market by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Redeeming the transferor partner (in the case of a redemption or  repurchase by the partnership); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Admitting the transferee as a partner or otherwise recognizing  any rights of the transferee, such as a right of the transferee to  receive partnership distributions (directly or indirectly) or to acquire  an interest in the capital or profits of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transfers not involving trading--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  section 7704(b) and this section, the following transfers (private  transfers) are disregarded in determining whether interests in a  partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the  substantial equivalent thereof--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transfers in which the basis of the partnership interest in the  hands of the transferee is determined, in whole or in part, by reference  to its basis in the hands of the transferor or is determined under  section 732;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transfers at death, including transfers from an estate or  testamentary trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transfers between members of a family (as defined in section  267(c)(4));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transfers involving the issuance of interests by (or on behalf  of) the partnership in exchange for cash, property, or services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transfers involving distributions from a retirement plan  qualified under section 401(a) or an individual retirement account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Block transfers (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Transfers pursuant to a right under a redemption or repurchase  agreement (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) that is  exercisable only--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Upon the death, disability, or mental incompetence of the  partner; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Upon the retirement or termination of the performance of  services of an individual who actively participated in the management  of, or performed services on a full-time basis for, the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Transfers pursuant to a closed end redemption plan (as  defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Transfers by one or more partners of interests representing in  the aggregate 50 percent or more of the total interests in partnership  capital and profits in one transaction or a series of related  transactions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Transfers not recognized by the partnership (within the meaning  of paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Block transfers. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this  section, a block transfer means the transfer by a partner and any  related persons (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) in  one or more transactions during any 30 calendar day period of  partnership interests representing in the aggregate more than 2 percent  of the total interests in partnership capital or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Redemption or repurchase agreement. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, a redemption or repurchase agreement means a  plan of redemption or repurchase maintained by a partnership whereby the  partners may tender their partnership interests for purchase by the  partnership, another partner, or a person related to another partner  (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Closed end redemption plan. For purposes of paragraph  (e)(1)(viii) of this section, a redemption or repurchase agreement (as  defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is a closed end redemption  plan only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The partnership does not issue any interest after the initial  offering (other than the issuance of additional interests prior to  August 5, 1988); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No partner or person related to any partner (within the meaning  of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) provides contemporaneous opportunities  to acquire interests in similar or related partnerships which represent  substantially identical investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Redemption and repurchase agreements. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, the transfer of an interest in a partnership  pursuant to a redemption or repurchase agreement (as defined in  paragraph (e)(3) of this section) that is not described in paragraph  (e)(1) (vii) or (viii) of this section is disregarded in determining  whether interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary  market or the substantial equivalent thereof only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The redemption or repurchase agreement provides that the  redemption or repurchase cannot occur until at least 60 calendar days  after the partner notifies the partnership in writing of the partner's  intention to exercise the redemption or repurchase right;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The redemption or repurchase agreement requires that the  redemption or repurchase price not be established until at least 60  calendar days after receipt of such notification by the partnership or  the partner; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The redemption or repurchase price is established not more than  four times during the partnership's taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sum of the percentage interests in partnership capital or  profits transferred during the taxable year of the partnership (other  than in private transfers described in paragraph (e) of this section)  does not exceed 10 percent of the total interests in partnership capital  or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Qualified matching services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  section 7704(b) and this section, the transfer of an interest in a  partnership through a qualified matching service is disregarded in  determining whether interests in the partnership are readily tradable on  a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. A matching service is a qualified matching service  only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The matching service consists of a computerized or printed  listing system that lists customers' bid and/or ask quotes in order to  match partners who want to sell their interests in a partnership (the  selling partner) with persons who want to buy those interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Matching occurs either by matching the list of interested  buyers with the list of interested sellers or through a bid and ask  process that allows interested buyers to bid on the listed interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The selling partner cannot enter into a binding agreement to  sell the interest until the 15th calendar day after the date information  regarding the offering of the interest for sale is made available to  potential buyers and such time period is evidenced by contemporaneous  records ordinarily maintained by the operator at a central location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The closing of the sale effected by virtue of the matching  service does not occur prior to the 45th calendar day after the date  information regarding the offering of the interest for sale is made  available to potential buyers and such time period is evidenced by  contemporaneous records ordinarily maintained by the operator at a  central location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The matching service displays only quotes that do not commit any  person to buy or sell a partnership interest at the quoted price  (nonfirm price quotes) or quotes that express interest in a partnership  interest without an accompanying price (nonbinding indications of  interest) and does not display quotes at which any person is committed  to buy or sell a partnership interest at the quoted price (firm quotes);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The selling partner's information is removed from the matching  service within 120 calendar days after the date information regarding  the offering of the interest for sale is made available to potential  buyers and, following any removal (other than removal by reason of a  sale of any part of such interest) of the selling partner's information  from the matching service, no offer to sell an interest in the  partnership is entered into the matching service by the selling partner  for at least 60 calendar days; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The sum of the percentage interests in partnership capital or  profits transferred during the taxable year of the partnership (other  than in private transfers described in paragraph (e) of this section)  does not exceed 10 percent of the total interests in partnership capital  or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Closing. For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section,  the closing of a sale occurs no later than the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The passage of title to the partnership interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payment of the purchase price (which does not include the  delivery of funds to the operator of the matching service or other  closing agent to hold on behalf of the seller pending closing); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date, if any, that the operator of the matching service  (or any person related to the operator within the meaning of section  267(b) or 707(b)(1)) loans, advances, or otherwise arranges for funds to  be available to the seller in anticipation of the payment of the  purchase price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Optional features. A qualified matching service may be sponsored  or operated by a partner of the partnership (either formally or  informally), the underwriter that handled the issuance of the  partnership interests, or an unrelated third party. In addition, a  qualified matching service may offer the following features--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The matching service may provide prior pricing information,  including information regarding resales of interests and actual prices  paid for interests; a description of the business of the partnership;  financial and reporting information from the partnership's financial  statements and reports; and information regarding material events  involving the partnership, including   special distributions, capital distributions, and refinancings or sales  of significant portions of partnership assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operator may assist with the transfer documentation  necessary to transfer the partnership interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The operator may receive and deliver funds for completed  transactions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The operator's fee may consist of a flat fee for use of the  service, a fee or commission based on completed transactions, or any  combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Private placements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section  7704(b) and this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph  (h)(2) of this section, interests in a partnership are not readily  tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All interests in the partnership were issued in a transaction  (or transactions) that was not required to be registered under the  Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The partnership does not have more than 100 partners at any  time during the taxable year of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain offerings outside of the United States.  Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to the offering and sale  of interests in a partnership that was not required to be registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 by reason of Regulation S (17 CFR  230.901 through 230.904) unless the offering and sale of the interests  would not have been required to be registered under the Securities Act  of 1933 if the interests had been offered and sold within the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anti-avoidance rule. For purposes of determining the number of  partners in the partnership under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section,  a person (beneficial owner) owning an interest in a partnership, grantor  trust, or S corporation (flow-through entity), that owns, directly or  through other flow-through entities, an interest in the partnership, is  treated as a partner in the partnership only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantially all of the value of the beneficial owner's  interest in the flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-through  entity's interest (direct or indirect) in the partnership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Lack of actual trading--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of  section 7704(b) and this section, interests in a partnership are not  readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent  thereof if the sum of the percentage interests in partnership capital or  profits transferred during the taxable year of the partnership (other  than in transfers described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this  section) does not exceed 2 percent of the total interests in partnership  capital or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (j):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABC,  a calendar year limited partnership formed in 1996, has 9,000 units of  limited partnership interests outstanding at all times during 1997,  representing in the aggregate 95 percent of the total interests in  capital and profits of ABC. The remaining 5 percent is held by the  general partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During 1997, the following transactions occur with respect to  the units of ABC's limited partnership interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 800 units are sold through the use of a qualified matching  service that meets the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 50 units are sold through the use of a matching service that  does not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 500 units are transferred as a result of private transfers  described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The private transfers of 500 units and the sale of 800 units  through a qualified matching service are disregarded under paragraph  (j)(1) of this section for purposes of applying the 2 percent rule. As a  result, the total percentage interests in partnership capital and  profits transferred for purposes of the 2 percent rule is .528 percent,  determined by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dividing the number of units sold through a matching service  that did not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section (50)  by the total number of outstanding limited partnership units (9,000);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiplying the result by the percentage of total interests  represented by limited partnership units (95 percent)   ([50 / 9,000] x.95 =.528 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABC operates a  service consisting of computerized video display screens on which  subscribers view and publish nonfirm price quotes that do not commit any  person to buy or sell a partnership interest and unpriced indications of  interest in a partnership interest without an accompanying price. The  ABC service does not provide firm quotes at which any person (including  the operator of the service) is committed to buy or sell a partnership  interest. The service may provide prior pricing information, including  information regarding resales of interests and actual prices paid for  interests; transactional volume information; and information on special  or capital distributions by a partnership. The operator's fee may  consist of a flat fee for use of the service; a fee based on completed  transactions, including, for example, the number of nonfirm quotes or  unpriced indications of interest entered by users of the service; or any  combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ABC service is not an established securities market for  purposes of section 7704(b) and this section. The service is not an  interdealer quotation system as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section because it does not disseminate firm buy or sell quotations.  Therefore, partnerships whose interests are listed and transferred on  the ABC service are not publicly traded for purposes of section 7704(b)  and this section as a result of such listing or transfers if the sum of  the percentage interests in partnership capital or profits transferred  during the taxable year of the partnership (other than in transfers  described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section) does not exceed  2 percent of the total interests in partnership capital or profits. In  addition, assuming the ABC service complies with the necessary  requirements, the service may qualify as a matching service described in  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Percentage interests in partnership capital or profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Interests considered--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (k), for purposes of this section, the total interests in  partnership capital or profits are determined by reference to all  outstanding interests in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General partner with greater than 10 percent  interest. If the general partners and any person related to the general  partners (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) own, in the  aggregate, more than 10 percent of the outstanding interests in  partnership capital or profits at any one time during the taxable year  of the partnership, the total interests in partnership capital or  profits are determined without reference to the interests owned by such  persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section are taken into account for  purposes of determining the total interests in partnership capital or  profits only if and to the extent that the partnership satisfies  paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this  section), the percentage interests in partnership capital or profits  represented by partnership interests that are transferred during a  taxable year of the partnership is equal to the sum of the percentage  interests transferred for each calendar month during the taxable year of  the partnership in which a transfer of a partnership interest occurs  (other than a private transfer as described in paragraph (e) of this  section). The percentage interests in capital or profits of interests  transferred during a calendar month is determined by reference to the  partnership interests outstanding during that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Monthly conventions. For purposes of paragraph (k)(2) of this  section, a partnership may use any reasonable convention in determining  the interests outstanding for a month, provided the convention is  consistently used by the partnership from month to month during a  taxable year and from year to year. Reasonable conventions include, but  are not limited to, a determination by reference to the interests  outstanding at the beginning of the month, on the 15th day of the month,  or at the end of the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Block transfers. For purposes of paragraph (e)(2) of this  section (defining block transfers), the partnership must determine the  percentage interests in capital or profits for each transfer of an  interest during the 30 calendar day period by reference to the  partnership interests outstanding immediately prior to such transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  paragraph (k):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABC limited partnership, a calendar year  partnership formed   in 1996, has 1,000 units of limited partnership interests outstanding on  January 1, 1997, representing in the aggregate 95 percent of the total  interests in capital and profits of ABC. The remaining 5 percent is held  by the general partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following transfers take place during 1997--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On January 15, 10 units of limited partnership interests are  sold in a transaction that is not a private transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On July 10, 1,000 additional units of limited partnership  interests are issued by the partnership (the general partner's  percentage interest is unchanged); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> On July 20, 15 units of limited partnership interests are sold  in a transaction that is not a private transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining the sum of the percentage  interests in partnership capital or profits transferred, ABC chooses to  use the end of the month convention. The percentage interests in  partnership capital and profits transferred during January is .95  percent, determined by dividing the number of transferred units (10) by  the total number of limited partnership units (1,000) and multiplying  the result by the percentage of total interests represented by limited  partnership units ([10/1,000]x.95). The percentage interests in  partnership capital and profits transferred during July is .7125 percent  ([15/2,000]x.95). ABC is not required to make determinations for the  other months during the year because no transfers of partnership  interests occurred during such months. ABC may qualify for the 2 percent  rule for its 1997 taxable year because less than 2 percent (.95  percent+.7125 percent=1.6625 percent) of its total interests in  partnership capital and profits was transferred during that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If ABC had chosen to use the beginning of the month convention,  the interests in capital or profits sold during July would have been  1.425 percent ([15/1,000]x.95) and ABC would not have satisfied the 2  percent rule for its 1997 taxable year because 2.375 percent (.95 +  1.425) of ABC's interests in partnership capital and profits was  transferred during that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (l)(2) of this section, this section applies to taxable years of a  partnership beginning after December 31, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this chapter) for guidance  regarding the definition of readily tradable on a secondary market or  the substantial equivalent thereof for purposes of section 7704(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Substantial new line of business. For purposes of paragraph  (l)(2) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantial is defined in Sec. 1.7704-2(c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A new line of business is defined in Sec. 1.7704-2(d), except  that the applicable date is ``December 4, 1995'' instead of ``December  17, 1987''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Termination under section 708(b)(1)(B). The termination of a  partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) due to the sale or exchange of 50  percent or more of the total interests in partnership capital and  profits is disregarded in determining whether a partnership qualifies  for the transition period provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
