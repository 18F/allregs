                            <p class="depth0">The following primary support documents and studies must be prepared  by the borrower for approval by RUS in order to support a loan  application:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Load forecast. The load forecast provides the borrower and RUS  with an understanding of the borrower's future system loads, the factors  influencing those loads, and estimates of future loads. The load  forecast provides a basis for projecting annual electricity (kWh) sales  and revenues, and for engineering estimates of plant additions required  to provide reliable service to meet the forecasted loads. Subpart E of  this part contains the information to be included in a load forecast and  when an approved load forecast is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction work plan (CWP). The CWP shall specify and document  the capital investments required to serve a   borrower's planned new loads, improve service reliability and quality,  and service the changing needs of existing loads. The requirements for a  CWP are set forth in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Long-range financial forecasts. RUS encourages borrowers to  maintain on a current basis a long-range financial forecast, which  should be used by a borrower's board of directors and manager to guide  the system toward its financial goals. The forecast submitted in support  of a loan application shall show the projected results of future actions  planned by the board of directors. The requirements for a long-range  financial forecast are set forth in subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Borrower's environmental report (BER). This document is used to  determine what effect the construction of the facilities included in the  construction work plan will have on the environment. In developing a BER  a borrower shall follow the policy and procedural requirements set forth  in 7 CFR part 1794. After reviewing the BER, RUS will determine whether  additional environmental studies will be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EE Program work plan (EEWP). In the case of a loan application  to finance an Eligible Energy Efficient Program, an EE Program work plan  shall be prepared in lieu of a traditional CWP required pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section. The requirements for an EEWP are set  forth in Sec. 1710.255 and in subpart H of this part.  [57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992, as amended at 65 FR 14786, Mar. 20, 2000; 78  FR 73366, Dec. 5, 2013]</p>
