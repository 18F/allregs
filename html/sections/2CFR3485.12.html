                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Department of Education (the ``Department'' or ``ED'')  adopts subparts A through I of the Office of Management and Budget  guidance in 2 CFR part 180. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to  the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the  Department. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of  Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR part 1986  Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (3  CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub.  L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The table of contents for this part contains only those sections  in part 3485 that include supplements to the guidance in part 180 and  new sections needed to implement the guidance for the Department's  programs. In those sections of the OMB guidance that are supplemented,  the section in part 3485 includes both the text of the OMB guidance that  is not affected by the change and any additional paragraphs that need to  be added to the OMB guidance. For example, Sec. 180.220 of this title  contains only paragraphs (a) and (b). The text of Sec. 3485.220, which  supplements Sec. 180.220 to extend lower-tier transactions to certain  transactions below the primary tier, includes both the text of paragraph  (a) and (b) of Sec. 180.220 and the text of added paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In those sections in part 180 that do not have paragraph  designations and that the Department supplements, the section in this  part implementing the OMB guidance designates the undesignated paragraph  from part 180 as paragraph (a) and the first supplemental paragraph as  paragraph (b). For example, 2 CFR 180.330 includes an undesignated lead  in paragraph and two subparagraphs designated (a) and (b). In  Sec. 3485.330, the undesignated paragraph in 2 CFR 180.330 is designated  paragraph (a) and the two subparagraphs are designated paragraphs (1)  and (2). The added paragraphs are designated paragraph (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The authority for all the provisions in 2 CFR part 180 as  adopted in this part is listed as follows.</p><p class="depth2">Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR  1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31  U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474.  (Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR  1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub.
