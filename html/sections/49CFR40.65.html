                            <p class="depth0">As a collector, you must check the following when the employee gives  the collection container to you:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sufficiency of specimen. You must check to ensure that the  specimen contains at least 45 mL of urine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it does not, you must follow ``shy bladder'' procedures (see  Sec. 40.193(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When you follow ``shy bladder'' procedures, you must discard the  original specimen, unless another problem (i.e., temperature out of  range, signs of tampering) also exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are never permitted to combine urine collected from separate  voids to create a specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must discard any excess urine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temperature. You must check the temperature of the specimen no  later than four minutes after the employee has given you the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The acceptable temperature range is 32-38 [deg]C/90-100 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the temperature of the specimen by reading  the temperature strip attached to the collection container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the specimen temperature is within the acceptable range, you  must mark the ``Yes'' box on the CCF (Step 2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you  must mark the ``No'' box and enter in the ``Remarks'' line (Step 2) your  findings about the temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you  must immediately conduct a new collection using direct observation  procedures (see Sec. 40.67).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In a case where a specimen is collected under direct observation  because of the temperature being out of range, you must process both the  original specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation  and send the two sets of specimens to the laboratory. This is true even  in a case in which the original specimen has insufficient volume but the  temperature is out of range. You must also, as soon as possible, inform  the DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place  under direct observation and the reason for doing so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In a case where the employee refuses to provide another specimen  (see Sec. 40.191(a)(3)) or refuses to provide another specimen under  direct observation (see Sec. 40.191(a)(4)), you must notify the DER. As  soon as you have notified the DER, you must discard any specimen the  employee has provided previously during the collection procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Signs of tampering. You must inspect the specimen for unusual  color, presence of foreign objects or material, or other signs of  tampering (e.g., if you notice any unusual odor).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it is apparent from this inspection that the employee has  tampered with the specimen (e.g., blue dye in the specimen, excessive  foaming when shaken, smell of bleach), you must immediately conduct a  new collection using direct observation procedures (see Sec. 40.67).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a case where a specimen is collected under direct observation  because of showing signs of tampering, you must process both the  original specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation  and send the two sets of specimens to the laboratory. This is true even  in a case in which the original specimen has insufficient volume but it  shows signs of tampering. You must also, as soon as possible, inform the  DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place under  direct observation and the reason for doing so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a case where the employee refuses to provide a specimen under  direct observation (see Sec. 40.191(a)(4)), you must discard any  specimen the employee provided previously during the collection  procedure. Then you must notify the DER as soon as practicable.  [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41950, Aug. 9, 2001]</p>
