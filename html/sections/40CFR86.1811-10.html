(i) Manufacturers may apply for alternate phase-in schedules that would still result in 100% phase-in by 2013 and 2015, respectively, for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs. An alternate phase-in schedule submitted by a manufacturer is subject to EPA approval. The alternate phase-in will not be used to delay full implementation past the last year of the primary phase-in schedule (2013 for LDV/LLDTs, 2015 for HLDT/MDPVs).

In addition, manufacturers electing to use an alternate phase-in schedule for compliance with the cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards must ensure that the sum of products is at least 100% for model years 2010 and earlier for LDV/LLDTs. For example, a phase-in schedule for LDV/LLDTs of 5/10/10/45/80/100 that begins in 2008 would calculate as (6x5%) + (5x10%) + (4x10%) = 120% and would be acceptable for 2008-2010. The full phase-in would calculate as (6x5%) + (5x10%) + (4x10%) + (3x45%) + (2x80%) + (1x100%) = 515% and would be acceptable for 2008-2013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For LDV/LLDTs, if the sum of products in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is greater than or equal to 500%, which is the sum of products from the primary phase-in schedule (4x25% + 3x50% + 2x75% + 1x100% = 500%), then the alternate phase-in schedule is acceptable, except as prohibited in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section.

In addition, manufacturers electing to use an alternate phase-in schedule for compliance with the cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards must ensure that the sum of products is at least 100% for model years 2012 and earlier for HLDT/MDPVs. Alternately, if the sum of products is greater than or equal to 600%, then the alternate phase-in schedule is acceptable, except as prohibited in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section.

For EPA to approve the use of actual volume produced for U.S. sales, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that actual production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs sold in all 50 U.S. States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> through (s) [Reserved].
