                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For projects where supplemental water is available, and you request and receive supplemental water, your assessment will include two components: a base rate, which is for your per-acre water duty delivered to your farm unit; and a supplemental water rate, which is for water delivered to your farm unit in addition to your per-acre water duty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We publish base and supplemental water rates annually in the Federal Register. The base and supplemental water rates are established to recover the costs identified in section 171.500(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your project has established a supplemental water rate, and you request and receive supplemental water, we will calculate your total annual operation and maintenance assessment by adding the following two totals:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total assessable acres of your land within the service area of our irrigation facility multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance assessment rate we establish for that facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The actual quantity of supplemental water you request and we agree to deliver (in acre-feet) times the supplemental water rate established for that facility.</p>
