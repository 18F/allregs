                                Sec. 2.102  Procedures for making requests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. You may make a request for EPA records that are not publicly available under Sec. 2.201(a)-(b) by writing directly to the appropriate FOI Officer, as listed in Sec. 2.101(a). Only written requests for records will be accepted for processing under this subpart. For records located at EPA Headquarters, or in those instances when you cannot determine where to send your request, you may send it to the Records, FOIA, and Privacy Branch, Office of Environmental Information, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460; e-mail: hq.foia@epa.gov. That office will forward your request to the regional FOI Office it believes most likely to have the records that you want. Your request will be considered received as of the date it is received by the correct FOI Office. Misdirected requests will not be considered received by EPA until the appropriate FOI Office receives the request. For proper handling, you should mark both your request letter and its envelope or e-mail subject line ``Freedom of Information Act Request.'' You should also include your name, mailing address, and daytime telephone number in the event we need to contact you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA employees may attempt in good faith to comply with oral requests for inspection or disclosure of EPA records publicly available under Sec. 2.201(a)-(b) , but such requests are not subject to the FOIA or the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Description of records sought. Your request should reasonably describe the records you are seeking in a way that will permit EPA employees to identify and locate them. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter. If known, you should include any file designations or descriptions for the records that you want. The more specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the more likely EPA will be able to identify and locate records responsive to your request. If EPA determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records, it will tell you either what additional information you need to provide or why your request is otherwise insufficient. EPA will also give you an opportunity to discuss and modify your request to meet the requirements of this section. Should it be necessary for you to provide a revised description of the records you are seeking, the time necessary to do so will be excluded from the statutory 20 working day period (or any authorized extension of time) that EPA has to respond to your request as discussed in Sec. 2.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreement to pay fees. If you make a FOIA request, EPA will consider your request to be an agreement that you will pay all applicable fees charged under Sec. 2.107, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. The EPA office responsible for responding to your request ordinarily will confirm this agreement in writing. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. Should it be necessary for you to provide a written agreement to pay additional fees, the time necessary to do so will be excluded from the statutory 20 working day period (or any authorized extension of time).</p>
