properly certified GBL attached to Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading.

If loss or damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, the consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last delivering TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the shipment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The rules and conditions governing commercial shipments for the time period within which notice must be given to the TSP, or a claim must be filed, or suit must be instituted, shall not apply if the shipment is lost, damaged or undergoes shrinkage in transit.
