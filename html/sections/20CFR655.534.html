                                Sec. 655.534  The first attestation element for locations in Alaska:
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(i)</em> of  this part, an employer need not request dispatch of United States  longshore workers directly from such parties. The requests for dispatch  of United States longshore workers pursuant to this section shall be  directed to contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to  employ United States longshore workers at that location, and to  operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore  workers. An employer is not required to request dispatch of United  States longshore workers from private dock operators or contract  stevedoring companies which do not meet the requirements of section 32  of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 932)  or, in the case of contract stevedoring companies, which are not  licensed to do business in the State of Alaska.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have signed  a joint collective bargaining agreement with a single qualified labor  organization, the employer may request longshore workers from only one  of such contract stevedoring companies. A qualified labor organization  is one which has been recognized as an exclusive bargaining  representative of United States longshore workers within the meaning of  the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.) and which makes  available or intends to make available workers to the particular  location where the longshore work is to be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock  may be made only for longshore work to be performed at that dock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employer shall not be required to request longshore workers  from a party if that party has notified the employer in writing that it  does not intend to make available United States longshore workers who  are qualified and available in sufficient numbers to the time and  location at which the longshore work is to be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A party that has provided such written notice to the employer  under paragraph (a)(3) of this section may subsequently notify the  employer in writing that it is prepared to make available United States  longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers  to perform the longshore activity at the time and location where the  longshore work is to be performed. In that event, the employer's  obligations to that party under Sec. Sec. 655.534 and 655.535 of this  part shall recommence 60 days after its receipt of such notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When a party has provided written notice to the employer under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section that it does not intend to dispatch  United States longshore workers to perform the longshore work attested  to by the employer, such notice shall expire upon the earliest of the  following events:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the terms of such notice specify an expiration date at  which time the employer's obligation to that party under Sec. Sec.  655.534 and 655.535 of this part shall recommence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When retracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon the expiration of the validity of the attestation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation. To substantiate the requirement in paragraph (a)  of   this section, an employer shall develop and maintain documentation to  meet the employer's burden of proof under the first attestation element.  The employer shall retain records of all requests for dispatch of United  States longshore workers to perform the longshore work attested to. Such  documentation shall consist of letters, telephone logs, facsimiles or  other memoranda to show that, before using alien crewmembers to perform  longshore work, the employer made a bona fide request for United States  longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers  to perform the longshore activity. At a minimum, such documentation  shall include the date the request was made, the name and telephone  number of the particular individual(s) to whom the request for dispatch  was directed, and the number and composition of full work units  requested. Further, whenever any party has provided written notice to  the employer under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the employer shall  retain the notice for the period of time specified in Sec. 655.533 of  this part, and, if appropriate, any subsequent notice by that party that  it is prepared to make available United States longshore workers at the  times and locations attested to.</p>
