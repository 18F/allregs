If there is disagreement among the  agencies, the following factors (which are listed in order of descending  importance) shall determine lead agency designation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Magnitude of agency's involvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Project approval/disapproval authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expertise concerning the action's environmental effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Duration of agency's involvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sequence of agency's involvement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any Federal agency, or any State or local agency or private  person substantially affected by the absence of lead agency designation,  may make a written request to the potential lead agencies that a lead  agency be designated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If Federal agencies are unable to agree on which agency will be  the lead agency or if the procedure described in paragraph (c) of this  section has not resulted within 45 days in a lead agency designation,  any of the agencies or persons concerned may file a request with the  Council asking it to determine which Federal agency shall be the lead  agency.  A copy of the request shall be transmitted to each potential lead  agency. The request shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A precise description of the nature and extent of the proposed  action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed statement of why each potential lead agency should or  should not be the lead agency under the criteria specified in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A response may be filed by any potential lead agency concerned  within 20 days after a request is filed with the Council.
