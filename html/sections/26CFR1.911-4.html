                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(25))</em> during the taxable year by  or on behalf of the individual attributable to housing in a foreign  country for the individual and any spouse or dependents who reside with  the individual (or live in a second foreign household described in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section) less the base housing amount as  defined in paragraph (c) of this section. The housing cost amount must  be reduced by the amount of any military or section 912 allowance or  similar allowance excludable from gross income that is intended to  compensate the individual or the individual's spouse in whole or in part  for the expenses of housing during the same period for which the  individual claims a housing cost amount exclusion or deduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Housing expenses--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Included expenses. For purposes of  paragraph (a) of this section, housing expenses include rent, the fair  rental value of housing provided in kind by the employer, utilities  (other than telephone charges), real and personal property insurance,  occupancy taxes not described in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section,  nonrefundable fees paid for securing a   leasehold, rental of furniture and accessories, household repairs, and  residential parking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excluded expenses. Housing expenses do not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost of house purchase, improvements, and other costs that  are capital expenditures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of purchased furniture or accessories or domestic  labor (maids, gardeners, etc.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Amortized payments of principal with respect to an evidence of  indebtedness secured by a mortgage on the taxpayer's housing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Depreciation of housing owned by the taxpayer, or amortization  or depreciation of capital improvements made to housing leased by the  taxpayer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Interest and taxes deductible under section 163 or 164 or other  amounts deductible under section 216(a) (relating to deduction of  interest and taxes by cooperative housing corporation tenant);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The expenses of more than one foreign household except as  provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Expenses excluded from gross income under section 119;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Expenses claimed as deductible moving expenses under section  217; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The cost of a pay television subscription.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitation. Housing expenses are taken into account for purposes  of this section only to the extent attributable to housing for portions  of the taxable year within the period during which the individual  satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.911-2(a). Housing expenses are not  taken into account for the period during which the value of the  individual's housing is excluded from gross income under section 119,  unless the individual maintains a second foreign household described in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If an individual maintains two foreign  households, only expenses incurred with respect to the abode which bears  the closest relationship, not necessarily geographic, with respect to  the individual's tax home shall be taken into account, unless one of the  households is a second foreign household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonableness. An amount paid for housing shall not be treated  as reasonable, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, to the  extent that the expense is lavish or extravagant under the  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses of a second foreign household--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term  ``second foreign household'' means a separate abode maintained by an  individual outside of the U.S. for his or her spouse or dependents (who,  if minors, are in the individual's legal custody or the joint custody of  the individual and the individual's spouse) at a place other than the  tax home of the individual because of adverse living conditions at the  individual's tax home. If an individual maintains a second foreign  household the expenses of the second foreign household may be included  in the individual's housing expenses under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. Under no circumstances shall an individual be considered to  maintain more than one second foreign household at the same time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adverse living conditions. Solely for purposes of paragraph  (b)(5)(i) of this section, adverse living conditions are living  conditions which are dangerous, unhealthful, or otherwise adverse.  Adverse living conditions include a state of warfare or civil  insurrection in the general area of the individual's tax home. Adverse  living conditions exist if the individual resides on the business  premises of the employer for the convenience of the employer and,  because of the nature of the business (for example, a construction site  or drilling rig), it is not feasible for the employer to provide housing  for the individual's spouse or dependents. The criteria used by the  Department of State in granting a separate maintenance allowance are  relevant, but not determinative, for purposes of determining whether a  separate household is provided because of adverse living conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Base housing amount--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The base housing amount is  equal to the product of 16 percent of the annual salary of an employee  of the United States who is compensated at a rate equal to the annual  salary rate paid for step 1 of grade GS-14, multiplied by the following  fraction:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.140   For purposes of the above fraction, the number of qualifying days is  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.911-3(d)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual salary of step 1 of grade GS-14. The annual salary rate  for a step 1 of grade GS-14 is determined on January first of the  calendar year in which the individual's taxable year begins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Housing cost amount exclusion--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitation. A qualified  individual who has elected to exclude his or her housing cost amount may  only exclude the lesser of the full amount of either the individual's  housing cost amount attributable to employer provided amounts or the  individual's foreign earned income for the taxable year. A qualified  individual who elects to exclude his or her housing cost amount may not  claim less than the full amount of the housing cost exclusion determined  under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employer provided amounts. For purposes of this section, the  term ``employer provided amounts'' means any amounts paid or incurred on  behalf of the individual by the individual's employer which are foreign  earned income included in the individual's gross income for the taxable  year (without regard to section 911). Employer provided amounts include,  but are not limited to, the following amounts: Any salary paid by the  employer to the employee; any reimbursement paid by the employer to the  employee for housing expenses, educational expenses for the individual's  dependents, or as part of a tax equalization plan; the fair market value  of compensation provided in kind (including lodging, unless excluded  under section 119, relating to meals and lodging furnished for the  convenience of the employer); and any amount paid by the employer to any  third party on behalf of the employee. An individual will only have  earnings that are not employer provided amounts if the individual has  earnings from self-employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Housing cost amount attributable to employer provided amounts.  For the purpose of determining what portion of the housing cost amount  is excludable and what portion is deductible the following rules apply.  If the individual has no income from self-employment, then the entire  housing cost amount is attributable to employer provided amounts and is,  therefore, excludable to the extent of the limitation provided in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the individual only has income from  self-employment, then the entire housing cost amount is attributable to  non-employer provided amounts and is, therefore, deductible to the  extent of the limitation provided in paragraph (e) of this section. In  all other instances, the housing cost amount attributable to employer  provided amounts shall be determined by multiplying the housing cost  amount by the following fraction: Employer provided amounts over foreign  earned income for the taxable year. The housing cost amount attributable  to non-employer provided amounts shall be determined by subtracting the  portion of the housing cost amount attributable to employer provided  amounts from the total housing cost amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Housing cost amount deduction--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a portion of  the individual's housing cost amount is determined under paragraph  (d)(3) of this section to be attributable to non-employer provided  amounts, the individual may deduct that amount from gross income for the  taxable year but only to the extent of the individual's foreign earned  income (as defined in Sec. 1.911-3) for the taxable year in excess of  foreign earned income excluded and the housing cost amount excluded from  gross income for the taxable year under Sec. 1.911-3 and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carryover. If any portion of the individual's housing cost  amount deduction is disallowed for the taxable year under paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, such portion shall be carried over and treated  as a deduction from gross income for the succeeding taxable year (but  only for the succeeding taxable year) to the extent of the excess, if  any, of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of foreign earned income for the succeeding taxable  year less the foreign earned income and the housing cost amount excluded  from gross income under Sec. 1.911-3 and this section for the succeeding  taxable year over,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The portion, if any, of the housing cost amount that is  deductible under paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the succeeding  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section. In all examples the annual rate for a step 1 of GS-14 as  of January first of the calendar year in which the individual's taxable  year begins is $39,689.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. B, a U.S. citizen is a calendar year taxpayer who was a  bona fide resident of and whose tax home was located in foreign country  G for the entire taxable year 1982. B receives an $80,000 salary from  B's employer for services performed in G. B incurs no business expenses.  B receives housing provided by B's employer with a fair rental value of  $15,000. The value of the housing furnished by B's employer is not  excluded from gross income under section 119. B pays $10,000 for housing  expenses. B's gross income and foreign earned income for 1982 is  $95,000. B elects the foreign earned income exclusion of section  911(a)(1) and the housing cost amount exclusion of section 911(a)(2). B  must first compute his housing cost amount exclusion. B's housing cost  amount is $18,650 determined by reducing B's housing expenses, $25,000  ($15,000 fair rental value of housing and $10,000 of other expenses), by  the base housing amount of $6,350 (($39,689x.16)x365/365). Because B has  no income from self-employment, the entire amount is attributable to  employer provided amounts and therefore, is excludable. B's section  911(a)(1) limitation is $75,000. That is the lesser of $75,000x365/365  or $95,000-18,650. B's total exclusion for 1982 under section 911(a)(1)  and (2) is $93,650.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that B's  salary for 1982 is $70,000. B's foreign earned income for 1982 is  $85,000. B's housing cost amount is $18,650, all of which is  attributable to employer provided amounts. B's housing cost amount is  excludable to the extent of the lesser of B's housing cost amount  attributable to employer provided amounts, $18,650, or the foreign  earned income for the taxable year, $85,000. Thus, B excludes $18,650  under section 911(a)(2). B's section 911(a)(1) limitation for 1982 is  $66,350 (the lesser of $75,000x365/365 or $85,000-18,650). B's total  exclusion for 1982 under section 911(a)(1) and (2) is $85,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that in  1983, B receives $5,000 attributable to services performed in 1982. B  may exclude the entire $5,000 in 1983 because such amount would have  been excludable under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1) had it been received in 1982.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. C is a U.S. citizen self-employed and a calendar year and  cash basis taxpayer. C arrived in foreign country H on October 3, 1982,  and departed from H on March 8, 1984. C's tax home was located in H  throughout that period. C was physically present for 330 full days  during the twelve consecutive month period August 30, 1982, through  August 29, 1983. The number of C's qualifying days in 1982 is 124.  During 1982 C had $35,000 of foreign earned income, none of which was  attributable to employer provided amounts and $8,000 of reasonable  housing expenses. C's housing cost amount is $5,843 ($8,000- ((39,689x.16)x124/365)). C elects to exclude her foreign earned income  under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1). C's section 911(a)(1) limitation for 1982 is  $25,479 (the lesser of C's foreign earned income for the taxable year  ($35,000) or the annual rate for the taxable year multiplied by the  number of C's qualifying days over the number of days in the taxable  year ($75,000x124/365=$25,479). C may not claim the housing cost amount  exclusion under section 911(a)(2) because no portion of the housing cost  amount is attributable to employer provided amounts. C may deduct the  lesser of her housing cost amount ($5,843) or her foreign earned income  in excess of amounts excluded under section 911(a) ($35,000- 25,479=$9,521). Thus, C's housing cost amount deduction is $5,843.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example 4 except that C had  $30,000 of foreign earned income for 1982, none of which was  attributable to employer provided amounts. C elects to exclude $25,479  under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1). C may only deduct $4,521 of her housing cost  amount under paragraph (e)(1) of this section because her foreign earned  income in excess of amounts excluded under section 911(a) is  $4,521($30,000-25,479). The $1,322 of unused housing cost amount  deduction may be carried over to the subsequent taxable year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. The facts are the same as in example 4 except that C had  $15,000 of foreign earned income of 1982, none of which was attributable  to employer provided amounts. C elects to exclude the entire $15,000  under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1). C is not entitled to a housing cost amount  deduction for 1982 since she has no foreign earned income in excess of  amounts excluded under section 911(a). C may carry over her entire  housing cost amount deduction to 1983.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. The facts are the same as in example 6. In addition,  during taxable year 1983 C had $115,000 of foreign earned income, none  of which was attributable to employer provided amounts, and $40,000 of  reasonable housing expenses C elects to exclude her foreign earned  income under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1). C's section 911(a)(1) limitation is the  lesser of $115,000 or $80,000 ($80,000x365/365). C's housing cost amount  for 1983 is $33,650 (40,000-(39,689x.16)x365/365). Since no portion of  that amount is attributable to employer provided amounts, C may not  claim a housing cost amount exclusion. C may deduct the lesser of her  housing cost amount ($33,650) or her foreign earned income in excess of   amounts excluded under section 911(a) ($115,000-80,000=35,000). Thus, C  may deduct her $33,650 housing cost amount in 1983. In addition, C may  deduct $1,350 of the housing cost amount deduction carried over from  taxable year 1982.  (($115.000-80,000)-33,650=$1,350). The remaining $4,493 ($5,843-1,350)  of the housing cost amount deduction carried over from taxable year 1982  may not be deducted in 1983 or carried over to 1984.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. D is a U.S. citizen and a calendar year and cash basis  taxpayer. D is a bona fide resident of and maintains his tax home in  foreign country J for all of taxable year 1984. In 1984, D earns $80,000  of foreign earned income, $60,000 of which is an employer provided  amount and $20,000 of which is a non-employer provided amount. D's total  housing cost amount for 1984 is $25,000. D elects to exclude, under  section 911(a)(2), the portion of his housing cost amount that is  attributable to employer provided amounts. D's excludable housing cost  amount is $18,750; that is the total housing cost amount ($25,000)  multiplied by employer provided amounts for the taxable year ($60,000)  over foreign earned income for the taxable year ($80,000). D also elects  to exclude his foreign earned income under Sec. 1.911-3(d)(1). D's  section 911(a)(1) limitation for 1984 is $61,250 (the lesser of $80,000- $18,750 or $80,000x366/366). D's total exclusion for 1984 under section  911(a)(1) and (2) is $80,000. D cannot claim a housing cost amount  deduction in 1984 because D has no foreign earned income in excess of  his foreign earned income and housing cost amount excluded from gross  income for the taxable year under Sec. 1.911-3 and this section. D may  carry over his housing cost amount deduction of $6,250, the total  housing cost amount less the portion attributable to employer provided  amounts ($25,000-18,750), to taxable year 1985.  (Sec. 911 (95 Stat. 194; 26 U.S.C. 911) and sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26  U.S.C. 7805) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)  [T.D. 8006, 50 FR 2970, Jan. 23, 1985]</p>
