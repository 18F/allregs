When records are  transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration for  storage in records centers, the accounting pertaining to those records  shall be transferred with the records themselves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any accounting made under this section shall be retained for at  least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after  the disclosure for which the accounting is made.
