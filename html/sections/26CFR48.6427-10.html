Claims relating to kerosene sold for use on a farm for farming purposes and by a State are made by registered ultimate vendors under Sec. 48.6427-9; claims relating to kerosene sold during certain periods of extreme cold for blending with diesel fuel to be used for heating purposes are made by registered ultimate vendors (blending) under Sec. 48.6427-11; and claims relating to kerosene used for nontaxable purposes are made by ultimate purchasers under Sec. 48.6427-8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.

Each claim for an income tax credit under this section must be made on Form 4136 (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form. Each claim for a payment under this section must be made on Form 8849 (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Content of claim. Each claim for a credit or payment under this section must contain the following information with respect to all of the kerosene covered by the claim:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant's ultimate vendor (blocked pump) registration number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total number of gallons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement by the claimant that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The kerosene did not contain visible evidence of dye; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of kerosene that contains visible evidence of dye, explains the circumstances under which tax was imposed on that kerosene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to each sale of more than five gallons of kerosene from a blocked pump that does not meet the conditions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, a statement by the claimant that it has in its possession the date of the sale, name and address of the buyer, and the number of gallons sold to the buyer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement by the claimant that it--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has not included the amount of the tax in its sales price of the kerosene and has not collected the amount of the tax from its buyer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has repaid the amount of the tax to its buyer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has obtained the written consent of its buyer to the allowance of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Time and place for filing claim.
