A fuel that is derived from renewable biomass, other than corn kernel starch, to include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Biofuel derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Biofuel derived from sugar and starch (other than ethanol derived from corn kernel starch);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Biofuel derived from waste material, including crop residue, other vegetative waste material, animal waste, food waste, and yard waste;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Diesel-equivalent fuel derived from renewable biomass, including vegetable oil and animal fat;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Butanol or other alcohols produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass.</p><p class="depth0">Advanced biofuel producer. An individual, corporation, company, foundation, association, labor organization, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, group of organizations, or non-profit entity that produces and sells an advanced biofuel. An entity that blends or otherwise combines advanced biofuels into a blended biofuel is not considered an advanced biofuel producer under this Program.</p><p class="depth0">Agency. The USDA Rural Development, Rural Business-Cooperative Service or its successor organization.</p><p class="depth0">Alcohol.

A blender is a processor of fuels who combines two or more fuels, one of which must be an advanced biofuel, for distribution and sale. Producers who blend one or more of their own fuels are not blenders under this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Certificate of analysis. A document approved by the Agency that certifies the quality and purity of the advanced biofuel being produced. The document must be from a qualified, independent third party.</p><p class="depth0">Contract.

A producer of advanced biofuels that meets all requirements of Sec. 4288.110 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible renewable biomass. Renewable biomass, as defined in this section, excluding corn kernel starch.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible renewable energy content. That portion of an advanced biofuel's energy content derived from eligible renewable biomass feedstock. The energy content from any portion of the biofuel, whether from, for example, blending with another fuel or a denaturant, that is derived from a non-eligible renewable biomass feedstock (e.g., corn kernel starch) is not eligible for payment under this Program.</p><p class="depth0">Enrollment application. Form RD 4288-1, ``Advanced Biofuel Payment Program Annual Application,'' which is submitted by advanced biofuel producers for participation in this Program.</p><p class="depth0">Ethanol.

produced at an advanced biofuel facility approved by the ATF for the production of ethanol for fuel, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> As denatured ethanol used by blenders and energy refiners, which has been rendered unfit for beverage use.</p><p class="depth0">Ethanol producer.
