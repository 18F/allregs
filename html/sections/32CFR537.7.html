Forwarding a copy of the  serious incident report, discussed in Sec. 536.22(c) of this chapter,  to USARCS, will meet this requirement. Thereafter, mirror file copies  will be furnished to USARCS in accordance with AR 27-20, paragraph 2-12.  This allows for continuous monitoring and discussion between the ACO and  the USARCS area action officer (AAO).</p>
