If the lands are otherwise available for selection, the States may select lands which are withdrawn, classified, or reported as valuable for coal, phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, asphaltic minerals, sodium, or sulphur, provided that the appropriate minerals are reserved to the United States in accordance with and subject to the regulations of subpart 2093.
