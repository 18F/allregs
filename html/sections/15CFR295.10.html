                            <p class="depth0">Each award by the Program shall contain procedures regarding  technical, business, and financial reporting and auditing requirements  to ensure that awards are being used in accordance with the Program's  objectives and applicable Federal cost principles. The purpose of the  technical reporting is to monitor ``best effort'' progress toward  overall project goals. The purpose of the business reporting system is  to monitor project performance against the Program's mission as required  by   the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) mandate for program  evaluation. The audit standards to be applied to ATP awards are the  ``Government Auditing Standards'' (GAS) issued by the Comptroller  General of the United States (also known as yellow book standards) and  the ATP program-specified audit guidelines. The ATP program-specific  audit guidelines include guidance on the number of audits required under  an award. In the interest of efficiency, the recipients are encouraged  to retain their own independent CPA firm to perform these audits. The  Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reserves the  right to conduct audits as deemed necessary and appropriate.  [62 FR 64686, Dec. 9, 1997.
