In the case of bulk packaging and dispensing, such supporting  information must be affixed to the bulk container or dispenser in the  same manner as the label, and in a readily visible location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The mean attenuation and standard deviation values obtained for  each test frequency according to Sec. 211.206, and the NRR calculated  from those values. For ``muff'' type protectors with various use  positions, the positions providing higher NRR values shall be  identified, and their associated NRR values listed in bold type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following statement, example and cautionary note: ``The  level of noise entering a person's ear, when hearing protector is worn  as directed, is closely approximated by the difference between the A- weighted environmental noise level and the NRR.</p><p class="depth2">Example</p><p class="depth2">1. The environmental noise level as measured at the ear is 92 dBA.</p><p class="depth2">2. The NRR is (value on label) decibels (dB).</p><p class="depth2">3. The level of noise entering the ear is approximately equal to [92  dB(A)--NRR] dB(A).</p><p class="depth2">Caution: For noise environments dominated by frequencies below 500  Hz the C-weighted environmental noise level should be used.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The month and year of production, which may be in the form of a  serial number or a code in those instances where the records specified  in Sec. 211.209(a)(1)(iv) are maintained;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following statement: ``Improper fit of this device will  reduce its effectiveness in attenuating noise. Consult the enclosed  instructions for proper fit'';</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Instructions as to the proper insertion or placement of the  device; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following statement: ``Although hearing protectors can be  recommended for protection against the harmful effects of impulsive  noise, the Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) is based on the attenuation of  continuous noise and may not be an accurate indicator of the protection  attainable against impulsive noise such as gunfire.''
