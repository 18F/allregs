                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. You must not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by Sec. 571.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples of a reasonable opportunity to opt out. The consumer is given a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By mail. The opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer. The consumer is given 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By electronic means. (i) The opt-out notice is provided electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at an Internet Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The opt-out notice is provided electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at an Internet Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer by e-mail where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail from the person sending the notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At the time of an electronic transaction. The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, such as a transaction conducted on an Internet Web site. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. There is a simple process that the consumer may use to opt out at that time using the same mechanism through which the transaction is conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the time of an in-person transaction. The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer in writing at the time

of an in-person transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as completing a form that requires consumers to write a ``yes'' or ``no'' to indicate their opt-out preference or that requires the consumer to check one of two blank check boxes--one that allows consumers to indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to indicate that they do not want to opt out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> By including in a privacy notice. The opt-out notice is included in a Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy notice. The consumer is allowed to exercise the opt-out within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt-out under that privacy notice.</p>
