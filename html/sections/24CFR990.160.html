                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Formula expenses represent the costs of services and  materials needed by a well-run PHA to sustain the project. These costs  include items such as administration, maintenance, and utilities. HUD  also determines a PHA's formula expenses at a project level. HUD uses  the following three factors to determine the overall formula expense  level for each project:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>The project expense level (PEL) (calculated in accordance with  Sec. 990.165);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The utilities expense level (UEL) (calculated in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 990.170, 990.175, 990.180, and 990.185); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>Other formula expenses (add-ons) (calculated in accordance with  Sec. 990.190).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PEL, UEL, and Add-ons. Each project of a PHA has a unique PEL  and UEL. The PEL for each project is based on ten characteristics and  certain adjustments described in Sec. 990.165. The PEL represents the  normal expenses of operating public housing projects, such as  maintenance and administration   costs. The UEL for each project represents utility expenses. Utility  expense levels are based on an incentive system aimed at reducing  utility expenses. Both the PEL and UEL are expressed in PUM costs. The  expenses not included in these expense levels and which are unique to  PHAs are titled ``other formula expenses (add-ons)'' and are expressed  in a dollar amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculating project formula expense. The formula expense of any  one project is the sum of the project's PEL and the UEL, multiplied by  the total EUMs specific to the project, plus the add-ons.</p>
