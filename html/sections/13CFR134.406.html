                                Sec. 134.406  Review of the administrative record.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> through (d) shall  be decided solely on a review of the written administrative record,  except as provided in Sec. 134.407 and in suspension appeals. For  suspension appeals under Sec. 134.401(e), see Sec. 124.305(d) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except in suspension appeals, the Administrative Law Judge's  review is limited to determining whether the Agency's determination is  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. As long as the Agency's  determination is reasonable, the Administrative Law Judge must uphold it  on appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The administrative record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative record must  contain all documents that are relevant to the determination on appeal  before the Administrative Law Judge and upon which the SBA decision- maker, and those SBA officials that recommended either for or against  the decision, relied. The administrative record, however, need not  contain all documents pertaining to the petitioner. For example, the  administrative record in a termination proceeding need not include the  Participant's entire business plan file, documents pertaining to  specific 8(a) contracts, or the firm's application for participation in  the 8(a) BD program if they are unrelated to the termination action. The  SBA may claim privilege as to certain materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The petitioner may object to the absence of a document,  previously submitted to, or sent by, SBA, which the petitioner believes  was erroneously omitted from the administrative record. The petitioner  also may object to a claim of privilege made by the SBA. The  petitioner's objections must be filed and served no later than 10 days  of its receipt of the administrative record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the absence of any objection by the petitioner or a finding  by the Judge pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section that the record  is insufficiently complete to decide whether the determination was  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the administrative record  submitted by SBA shall be deemed complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the Agency files its response to the appeal petition after  the date specified in Sec. 134.206, the Administrative Law Judge may  decline to consider the response and base his or her decision solely on  a review of the administrative record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remand. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may remand a case to  the   Director, Office of Business Development (or, in the case of a denial of  a request for waiver under Sec. 124.515 of this chapter, to the  Administrator) for further consideration if he or she determines that,  due to the absence in the written administrative record of the reasons  upon which the determination was based, the administrative record is  insufficiently complete to decide whether the determination is  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. In the event of such a  remand, the Judge will not require the SBA to supplement the  administrative record other than to supply the reason or reasons for the  determination and any documents submitted to, or considered by, SBA in  connection with any reconsideration permitted by regulation that occurs  during the remand period. After such a remand, in the event the Judge  finds that the reasons upon which the determination is based are absent  from any supplemented record, the Judge will find the SBA determination  to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may also remand a case to the  Director, Office of Business Development (or, in the case of a denial of  a request for waiver under Sec. 124.515 of this chapter, to the  Administrator) for further consideration where it is clearly apparent  from the record that SBA made an erroneous factual finding (e.g., SBA  double counted an asset of an individual claiming disadvantaged status)  or a mistake of law (e.g., SBA applied the wrong regulatory provision in  evaluating the case).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may remand an eligibility, early  graduation, or termination appeal to the Director, Office of Business  Development, where the determination raises a new ground that was not in  the initial SBA determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A remand under this section will be for a reasonable period.
