Costs are  those attributed to the screening of passengers and property in the  United States for both flights within the United States and flights from  the United States to foreign destinations. Reported costs must be  consistent with the air carrier's financial accounting information  reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p class="depth0">Where actual costs of screening passengers and property cannot be  directly identified through an air carrier's accounting system, the air  carrier shall use an appropriate alternate cost assignment methodology.  Documentation that explains and supports the assignment methodology  used, the applicable pool and the allocation basis must be made  available upon request. For costs related to capitalized property,  please report the associated depreciation expense incurred during   calendar year 2000. Capitalization policy must also be made available  upon request.</p><p class="depth0">To the extent necessary, the reporting air carrier may aggregate  those specific costs that have been incurred but cannot be stated in the  detailed cost categories requested by this form. However, all of the  costs identified by this form must be included in the total  calculations. In addition, explanations regarding costs that have been  aggregated need to be provided. Costs reported in Appendix A do not need  to include costs that may have been incurred for a position higher than  those of the air carrier's director of security (or equivalent). Costs  incurred for higher positions, such as those of the air carrier's chief  executive officer, do not need to be included.</p><p class="depth0">When including cost information on acquired and/or merged air  carriers, the successor air carrier must specify the names of all of  such entities whose calendar year 2000 passenger and property screening  costs are included in that air carrier's submission as Appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">The costs listed below are to be in US dollars, rounded to the  nearest dollar.
