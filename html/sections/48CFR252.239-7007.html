                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 239.7411(a), use the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Cancellation or Termination of Orders (NOV 2005)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made available to the Government, the Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and termination charges which--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, as defined in the Rates, Charges, and Services clause of this agreement/contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are in effect on the date of termination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined under the following settlement procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The actual nonrecoverable costs are the installed costs of the facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net salvage value. Installed costs shall include the actual cost of equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the actual cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable to the capital accounts of the Contractor) less any costs the Government may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract. Deduct from the Contractor's installed cost, the net salvage value (salvage value less cost of removal). In determining net salvage value, give consideration to foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor. Make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either to the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Basic Cancellation Liability is defined as the actual nonrecoverable cost which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor at the time services are cancelled. The Basic Termination Liability is defined as the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal monthly increments throughout the liability period. Upon termination of services, the Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated. Establish the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability established by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time of termination or cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvagable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Contractor agrees to exclude--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the canceled or terminated portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these payments if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer the total of the payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the Government upon demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
