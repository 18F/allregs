                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of the opt-out notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An opt-out  notice must be in writing, be clear and conspicuous, as well as concise,  and must accurately disclose the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name of the affiliate that has or previously had a pre- existing business relationship with a consumer, which is providing the  notice; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If jointly provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each  affiliate shares a common name, then the notice may indicate that it is  being provided by multiple companies with the same name or multiple  companies in the same group or family of companies. If the affiliates  providing the notice do not share a common name, then the notice must  either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of  the common names used by those affiliates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The list of affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of  eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include  companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the  consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A general description of the types of eligibility information  that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the consumer may elect to limit the use of  eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A statement that the consumer's election will apply for the  specified period of time and, if applicable, that the consumer will be  allowed to renew the election once that period expires;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the notice is provided to consumers who have previously  elected to opt out, that such consumer does not need to act again until  the consumer receives a renewal notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specifying length of time period. If consumer is granted an opt- out period longer than a five-year duration, the opt-out notice must  specify the length of the opt-out period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No revised notice for extension of opt-out period. The duration  of an opt-out period may be increased for a period longer than the  period specified in   the opt-out notice without having to provide a revised notice of the  increase to the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Joint relationships. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If two or more consumers jointly obtain  a financial product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided  to joint consumers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out on  behalf of each joint consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The opt-out election notice must explain how an opt-out election  by a joint consumer will be treated. That is, the notice should specify  whether an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated as  applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or as applying to  each joint consumer separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the opt-out election notice provides that each joint consumer  is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be  permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the  joint consumer must be permitted to exercise his or her separate rights  to opt out in a single response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A covered affiliate cannot require all joint consumers to opt  out before implementing any opt-out election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative contents. If the consumer is afforded a broader  right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this  subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing  the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that  accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Coordinated and consolidated consumer notices. A notice required  by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other  notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of  law by the covered affiliate providing the notice, including but not  limited to notices in the FCRA or the GLB Act privacy notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equivalent notices. A notice or disclosure that is equivalent to  the notice required by this part in terms of content, and that is  provided to a consumer together with a notice required by any other  provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Model notices. Model notices are provided in appendix A of this  part. These notices were meant to facilitate compliance with this  subpart; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be interpreted to  require persons subject to this part to use the model notices.</p>
