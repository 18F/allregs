                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each compliance period to demonstrate continuous compliance, you must use no coating for which the organic HAP content (determined

using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4541) exceeds the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4490, and use no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contains organic HAP, determined according to Sec. 63.4541(a). A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month, after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4540, is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. If you are complying with a facility-specific emission limit under Sec. 63.4490(c), you must also perform the calculation using Equation 1 in Sec. 63.4490(c)(2) on a monthly basis using the data from the previous 12 months of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating, thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4510(c)(6) and 63.4520(a)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required by Sec. 63.4520, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4490, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4490, and you used no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contained organic HAP, determined according to Sec. 63.4541(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4530 and 63.4531.</p><p class="depth2">Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls</p><p class="depth2">Option</p>
