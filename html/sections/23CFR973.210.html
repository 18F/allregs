It is also available from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), Publication Order Dept., P.O. Box 96716, Washington, DC 20090-6716 or online at http://www.transportation.org/publications/bookstore.nsf.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A BMS shall be designed to fit the BIA's or tribe's goals, policies, criteria, and needs using the following components, as a minimum, as a basic framework for a BMS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A database and an ongoing program for the collection and maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data needed to support the BMS. The minimum BMS database shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inventory data described by the NBIS (23 CFR part 650, subpart C);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data characterizing the severity and extent of deterioration of bridge components;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Data for estimating the cost of improvement actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Traffic information including volumes and vehicle classification (as appropriate); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A history of conditions and actions taken on each bridge, excluding minor or incidental maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A systematic procedure for applying network level analytical procedures that are capable of analyzing data for all bridges in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A prediction of performance and estimate of the remaining service life of structural and other key elements of each bridge, both with and without intervening actions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A recommendation for optimal allocation of limited funds by developing a prioritized list of candidate projects over a predefined planning horizon (both short and long term).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The BMS may include the capability to perform an investment analysis (as appropriate, considering size of structure, traffic volume, and structural condition). The investment analysis may include the ability to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify alternative strategies to improve bridge condition, safety and serviceability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimate the costs of any strategies ranging from maintenance of individual elements to full bridge replacement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for bridge elements using life cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Perform short and long term budget forecasting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For any bridge in the inventory or subset thereof, BMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of non-deficient bridges.</p>
