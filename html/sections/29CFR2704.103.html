                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by this  Commission. These are adjudications before the Commission arising under  the Mine Act in which the position of the Secretary of Labor is  represented by an attorney or other representative who enters an  appearance and participates in the proceeding. For this Commission, the  types of proceedings generally covered include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contests of citations or orders issued under section 104 or 107  of the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 814, 817);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contests of penalties proposed under section 105 (a) and (b) of  the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 815(a), (b));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Challenges to claims of discrimination under section 105(c) of  the Mine Act (30 U.S.C. 815(c)) where the Secretary of Labor represents  the miner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission may also designate a proceeding not listed in  paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes  of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or  designating the matter for hearing. The Commission's failure to  designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude  the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is  covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an  issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and  matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include  only fees and expenses related to covered issues.  [47 FR 1001, Mar. 9, 1982, as amended at 71 FR 54905, Sept. 20, 2006]</p>
