The notification will state the reasons for the imposition of the additional requirements, state that the employer's agreement to accept the conditions will constitute their inclusion as bona fide conditions and terms of a temporary labor certification, and offer the employer an opportunity to request an administrative review. If administrative review is requested, the procedures in Sec. 655.61 apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assisted recruitment.
