                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition of gross estate. Except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph the value of the gross estate of a decedent who was a citizen  or resident of the United States at the time of his death is the total  value of the interests described in sections 2033 through 2044. The  gross estate of a decedent who died before October 17, 1962, does not  include real property situated outside the United States (as defined in  paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 20.0-1). Except as provided in paragraph (c)  of this section (relating to the estates of decedents dying after  October 16, 1962, and before July 1, 1964), in the case of a decedent  dying after October 16, 1962, real property situated outside the United  States which comes within the scope of sections 2033 through 2044 is  included in the gross estate to the same extent as any other property  coming within the scope of those sections. In arriving at the value of  the gross estate the interests described in sections 2033 through 2044  are valued as described in this section, Sec. Sec. 20.2031-2 through  20.2031-9 and Sec. 20.2032-1. The contents of sections 2033 through  2044 are, in general, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 2033 and 2034 are concerned mainly with interests in  property passing through the decedent's probate estate. Section 2033  includes in the decedent's gross estate any interest that the decedent  had in property at the time of his death. Section 2034 provides that any  interest of the decedent's surviving spouse in the decedent's property,  such as dower or curtesy, does not prevent the inclusion of such  property in the decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sections 2035 through 2038 deal with interests in property  transferred by the decedent during his life under such circumstances as  to bring the interests within the decedent's gross estate. Section 2035  includes in the decedent's gross estate property transferred in  contemplation of death, even though the decedent had not interest in, or  control over, the property at the time of his death. Section 2036  provides for the inclusion of transferred property with respect to which  the decedent retained the income or the power to designate who shall  enjoy the income. Section 2037 includes in the decedent's gross estate  certain transfers under which the beneficial enjoyment of the property  could be obtained only by surviving the decedent. Section 2038 provides  for the inclusion of transferred property if the decedent had at the  time of his death the power to change the beneficial enjoyment of the  property. It should be noted that there is considerable overlap in the  application of sections 2036 through 2038 with respect to reserved  powers, so that transferred property may be includible in the decedent's  gross estate in varying degrees under more than one of those sections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sections 2039 through 2042 deal with special kinds of property  and powers. Sections 2039 and 2040 concern annuities and jointly held  property respectively. Section 2041 deals with powers held by the  decedent over the beneficial enjoyment of property not originating with  the decedent. Section 2042 concerns insurance under policies on the life  of the decedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 2043 concerns the sufficiency of consideration for  transfers made by the decedent during his life. This has a bearing on  the amount to be included in the decedent's gross estate under sections  2035 through 2038, and 2041. Section 2044 deals with retroactivity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of property in general. The value of every item of  property includible in a decedent's gross estate under sections 2031  through 2044 is its fair market value at the time of the decedent's  death, except that if the executor elects the alternate valuation method  under section 2032, it is the fair market value thereof at the date, and  with the adjustments, prescribed in that section. The fair market value  is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing  buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or  to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair  market value of a particular item of property includible in the  decedent's gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price.  Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by  the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such  item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the  location of the item wherever appropriate. Thus, in the case of an item  of property includible in the decedent's gross estate, which is  generally obtained by the public in the retail market, the fair market  value of such an item of property is the price at which the item or a  comparable item would be sold at retail. For example, the fair market  value of an automobile (an article generally obtained by the public in  the retail market) includible in the decedent's gross estate is the  price for which an automobile of the same or approximately the same  description, make, model, age, condition, etc., could be purchased by a  member of the general public and not the price for which the particular  automobile of the decedent would be purchased by a dealer in used  automobiles. Examples of items of property which are generally sold to  the public at retail may be found in Sec. Sec. 20.2031-6 and 20.2031-8.  The value is generally to be determined by ascertaining as a basis the  fair market value as of the applicable valuation date of each unit of  property. For example, in the case of shares of stock or bonds, such  unit of property is generally a share of stock or a bond. Livestock,  farm machinery, harvested and growing crops must generally be itemized  and the value of each item separately returned. Property shall not be  returned at the value at which it is assessed for local tax purposes  unless that value represents the fair market value as of the applicable  valuation date. All relevant facts and elements of value as of the  applicable valuation date shall be considered in every case. The value  of items of property which were held by the decedent for sale in the  course of a business generally should be reflected in the value of the  business. For valuation of interests in businesses, see Sec. 20.2031-3.  See Sec. 20.2031-2 and Sec. Sec. 20.2031-4 through 20.2031-8 for  further information concerning the valuation of other particular kinds  of property. For certain circumstances under which the sale of an item  of property at a price below its fair market value may result in a  deduction for the estate, see paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 20.2053-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Real property situated outside the United States; gross estate  of decedent dying after October 16, 1962, and before July 1, 1964--(1)  In general. In the case of decedent dying after October 16, 1962, and  before July 1, 1964, the value of real property situated outside the  United States (as defined in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 20.0-1) is not  included in the gross estate of the decedent--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under section 2033, 2034, 2035(a), 2036(a), 2037(a), or 2038(a)  to the extent the real property, or the decedent's interest in it, was  acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 2040 to the extent such property or interest was  acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962,   or was held by the decedent and the survivor in a joint tenancy or  tenancy by the entirety before February 1, 1962; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under section 2041(a) to the extent that before February 1,  1962, such property or interest was subject to a general power of  appointment (as defined in section 2041) possessed by the decedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain property treated as acquired before February 1, 1962.  For purposes of this paragraph real property situated outside the United  States (including property held by the decedent and the survivor in a  joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety), or an interest in such  property or a general power of appointment in respect of such property,  which was acquired by the decedent after January 31, 1962, is treated as  acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962, if</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such property, interest, or power was acquired by the decedent  by gift within the meaning of section 2511, or from a prior decedent by  devise or inheritance, or by reason of death, form of ownership, or  other conditions (including the exercise or nonexercise of a power of  appointment); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before February 1, 1962, the donor or prior decedent had  acquired the property or his interest therein or had possessed a power  of appointment in respect thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain property treated as acquired after January 31, 1962. For  purposes of this paragraph that portion of capital additions or  improvements made after January 31, 1962, to real property situated  outside the United States is, to the extent that it materially increases  the value of the property, treated as real property acquired after  January 31, 1962. Accordingly, the gross estate may include the value of  improvements on unimproved real property, such as office buildings,  factories, houses, fences, drainage ditches, and other capital items,  and the value of capital additions and improvements to existing  improvements, placed on real property after January 31, 1962, whether or  not the value of such real property or existing improvements is included  in the gross estate.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6684, 28 FR  11408, Oct. 24, 1963; T.D. 6826, 30 FR 7708, June 15, 1965]</p>
