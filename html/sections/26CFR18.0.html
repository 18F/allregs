The election may be made only with the consent of each shareholder to whom the corporation makes a distribution (whether or not it is a cash distribution) during such post-termination transition period. Any such election shall be made by the corporation by attaching to its income tax return for the C year in which such post-termination transition period ends a statement which clearly indicates that the corporation elects to have section 1371(e)(1) not apply to all distributions made during such post-termination transition period. The election shall not be effective unless such statement is signed by a person authorized to sign the return required to be filed under section 6012 and by each shareholder required to consent to the election.

Sec.  18.1379-1  Transitional rules on enactment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior elections. Any election that was made under section 1372(a) (as in effect before the enactment of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982), and that is still in effect as of the first day of a taxable year beginning in 1983, shall be treated as being an election made under section 1362(a). In addition, any election that was made under section 1371(g)(2) (as in effect before the enactment of that Act), and that is still in effect as of the first day of a taxable year beginning in 1983, shall be treated as being an election made under section 1362(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prior terminations. For purposes of section 1362(g), any termination under section 1372(e) (as in effect before the enactment of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982) shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner of making an election under section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982. In the case of a qualified oil corporation (as defined in section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982), the corporation may elect under that section of the Act to have the amendments made by the Act not apply and to have Subchapter S (as in effect on July 1, 1982), Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply.

The statement shall be signed by any person authorized to sign the return required to be filed under section 6037 and by each person who is or was a shareholder in the corporation at any time during the taxable year beginning in 1983 and shall be filed with the return for that taxable year.

If later regulations issued under the section of the Code or of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 under which the election, consent, or refusal was made require the furnishing of information in addition to that which was furnished with the statement of election, consent, or refusal as provided by part 18 of this title, and if an office of the Internal Revenue Service requests the taxpayer to provide the additional information, the taxpayer shall furnish the additional information in a statement filed with that office of the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days after the date on which the request is made. This statement shall also--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each party identified in connection with the election, consent, or refusal,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the election, consent, or refusal by reference to the section of the Code or Act under which the election, consent, or refusal was made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the scope of the election, consent, or refusal.
