                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Documentation of request. All transfers and assumptions must be approved in writing by the Agency and must be to eligible applicants in accordance with subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. An individual credit report must be provided for transferee proprietors, partners, officers, directors, and stockholders with 20 percent or more interest in the business, along with such other documentation as the Agency may request to determine eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms. Loan terms must not be changed unless the change is approved in writing by the Agency with the concurrence of any holder and the transferor (including guarantors) if they have not been or will not be released from liability. Any new loan terms must be within the terms authorized by 4279.126 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. The lender's request for approval of new loan terms will be supported by an explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in loan terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Release of liability. The transferor, including any guarantor, may be released from liability only with prior Agency written concurrence and only when the value of the collateral being transferred is at least equal to the amount of the loan being assumed and is supported by a current appraisal and a current financial statement. The Agency will not pay for the appraisal. If the transfer is for less than the debt, the lender must demonstrate to the Agency that the transferor and guarantors have no reasonable debt-paying ability considering their assets and income in the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proceeds. Any proceeds received from the sale of collateral before a transfer and assumption will be credited to the transferor's guaranteed loan debt in inverse order of maturity before the transfer and assumption are closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional loans. Loans to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption must be considered as a new loan application under subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Credit quality. The lender must make a complete credit analysis which is subject to Agency review and approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Documents. Prior to Agency approval, the lender must advise the Agency, in writing, that the transaction can be properly and legally transferred, and the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, or recorded as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assumption will be done on the lender's form of assumption agreement and will contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee. The lender will provide the Agency with a copy of the transfer and assumption agreement. The lender must ensure that all transfers and assumptions are noted on all original Loan Note Guarantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A new Loan Agreement, consistent in principle with the original Loan Agreement, should be executed to

establish the terms and conditions of the loan being assumed. An assumption agreement can be used to establish the loan covenants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender will provide to the Agency a written certification that the transfer and assumption is valid, enforceable, and complies with all Agency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Loss resulting from transfer. If a loss should occur upon consummation of a complete transfer and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor (including personal guarantors) is released from liability, the lender, if it holds the guaranteed portion, may file an estimated report of loss to recover its pro rata share of the actual loss. If a holder owns any of the guaranteed portion, such portion must be repurchased by the lender or the Agency in accordance with 4279.78(c) of subpart A of part 4279 of this chapter. In completing the report of loss, the amount of the debt assumed will be entered as net collateral (recovery). Approved protective advances and accrued interest thereon made during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption will be included in the calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Related party. If the transferor and transferee are affiliated or related parties, any transfer and assumption must be for the full amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payment requests. Requests for a loan guarantee to provide equity for a transfer and assumption must be considered as a new loan under subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Cash downpayment. When the transferee will be making a cash downpayment as part of the transfer and assumption:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender must have an appropriate appraiser, acceptable to both the transferee and transferor and currently authorized to perform appraisals, determine the value of the collateral securing the loan. The appraisal fee and any other costs will not be paid by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The market value of the collateral, plus any additional property the transferee proposes to offer as collateral, must be adequate to secure the balance of the guaranteed loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash downpayments may be paid directly to the transferor provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lender recommends that the cash be released, and the Agency concurs prior to the transaction being completed. The lender may wish to require that an amount be retained for a defined period of time as a reserve against future defaults. Interest on such account may be paid periodically to the transferor or transferee as agreed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lender determines that the transferee has the repayment ability to meet the obligations of the assumed guaranteed loan as well as any other indebtedness;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any payments by the transferee to the transferor will not suspend the transferee's obligations to continue to meet the guaranteed loan payments as they come due under the terms of the assumption; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transferor agrees not to take any action against the transferee in connection with the assumption without prior written approval of the lender and the Agency.</p>
