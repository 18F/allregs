                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification. When an inspection, review, or investigation of a  certified operation by a certifying agent or a State organic program's  governing State official reveals any noncompliance with the Act or  regulations in this part, a written notification of noncompliance shall  be sent to the certified operation. Such notification shall provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of each noncompliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facts upon which the notification of noncompliance is based;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date by which the certified operation must rebut or correct  each noncompliance and submit supporting documentation of each such  correction when correction is possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Resolution. When a certified operation demonstrates that each  noncompliance has been resolved, the certifying agent or the State  organic program's governing State official, as applicable, shall send  the certified operation a written notification of noncompliance  resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proposed suspension or revocation. When rebuttal is unsuccessful  or correction of the noncompliance is not completed within the  prescribed time period, the certifying agent or State organic program's  governing State official shall send the certified operation a written  notification of proposed suspension or revocation of certification of  the entire operation or a portion of   the operation, as applicable to the noncompliance. When correction of a  noncompliance is not possible, the notification of noncompliance and the  proposed suspension or revocation of certification may be combined in  one notification. The notification of proposed suspension or revocation  of certification shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reasons for the proposed suspension or revocation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed effective date of such suspension or revocation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The impact of a suspension or revocation on future eligibility  for certification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The right to request mediation pursuant to Sec. 205.663 or to  file an appeal pursuant to Sec. 205.681.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Willful violations. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this  section, if a certifying agent or State organic program's governing  State official has reason to believe that a certified operation has  willfully violated the Act or regulations in this part, the certifying  agent or State organic program's governing State official shall send the  certified operation a notification of proposed suspension or revocation  of certification of the entire operation or a portion of the operation,  as applicable to the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Suspension or revocation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the certified operation fails  to correct the noncompliance, to resolve the issue through rebuttal or  mediation, or to file an appeal of the proposed suspension or revocation  of certification, the certifying agent or State organic program's  governing State official shall send the certified operation a written  notification of suspension or revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certifying agent or State organic program's governing State  official must not send a notification of suspension or revocation to a  certified operation that has requested mediation pursuant to  Sec. 205.663 or filed an appeal pursuant to Sec. 205.681, while final  resolution of either is pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certified operation whose certification has  been suspended under this section may at any time, unless otherwise  stated in the notification of suspension, submit a request to the  Secretary for reinstatement of its certification. The request must be  accompanied by evidence demonstrating correction of each noncompliance  and corrective actions taken to comply with and remain in compliance  with the Act and the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certified operation or a person responsibly connected with an  operation whose certification has been revoked will be ineligible to  receive certification for a period of 5 years following the date of such  revocation, Except, That, the Secretary may, when in the best interest  of the certification program, reduce or eliminate the period of  ineligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Violations of Act. In addition to suspension or revocation, any  certified operation that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(xxxvii)</em> of this title'' per  violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Makes a false statement under the Act to the Secretary, a State  organic program's governing State official, or a certifying agent shall  be subject to the provisions of section 1001 of title 18, United States  Code.
