                            <p class="depth0">A lessee shall have the right to use so much of the leased lands as  is necessary to explore for, drill for, mine, extract, remove and  dispose of all the leased resource in a leasehold subject to:  Stipulations attached to the lease; restrictions deriving from specific,  nondiscretionary statutes; and such reasonable measures as may be  required by the authorized officer to minimize adverse impacts to other  resource values, land uses or users not addressed in the lease  stipulations at the time operations are proposed. To the extent  consistent with lease rights granted, such reasonable measures may  include, but are not limited to, modification to siting or design of  facilities, timing of operations, and specification of interim and final  reclamation measures. At a minimum, measures shall be deemed consistent  with lease rights granted provided that they do not: require relocation  of proposed operations by more than 200 meters; require that operations  be sited off the leasehold; or prohibit new surface disturbing  operations for a period in excess of 60 days in any lease year.
