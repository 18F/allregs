bond is insufficient to pay the total cost of reclamation, moneys sufficient to complete the reclamation may be sought under part 886 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The reclamation has been requested by the Governor of the State or equivalent head of the Indian tribe; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The reclamation is necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of noncoal mining practices.
