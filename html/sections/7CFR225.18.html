                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grant closeout procedures. Grant closeout procedures for the  Program shall be in accordance with 7 CFR part 3016 or 7 CFR part 3019,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination for cause. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may terminate a State agency's  participation in the Program in whole, or in part, whenever it is  determined that the State agency has failed to comply with the  conditions of the Program. FNS shall promptly notify the State agency in  writing of the termination and reason for the termination, together with  the effective date, and shall allow the State 30 calendar days to  respond. In instances where the State does respond, FNS shall inform the  State of its final determination no later than 30 calendar days after  the State responds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State agency shall terminate a sponsor's participation in the  Program by written notice whenever it is determined by the State agency  that the sponsor has failed to comply with the conditions of the  Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When participation in the Program has been terminated for cause,  any funds paid to the State agency or a sponsor or any recoveries by FNS  from the State agency or by the State agency from a sponsor shall be in  accordance with the legal rights and liabilities of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination for convenience. FNS and the State agency may agree  to terminate the State agency's participation in the Program in whole,  or in part, when both parties agree that the continuation of the Program  would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further  expenditure of funds. The two parties shall agree upon the termination  conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial  termination, the portion to be terminated. The State agency shall not  incur new obligations for the terminated portion after the effective  date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The  Department shall allow full credit to the State agency for the Federal  share of the noncancellable obligation properly incurred by the State  agency prior to termination. A State agency may terminate a sponsor's  participation in the manner provided for in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance of effort. Expenditure of funds from State and local  sources for the maintenance of food programs for children shall not be  diminished as a result of funds received under the Act and a  certification to this effect shall become part of the agreement provided  for in Sec. 225.3(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program benefits. The value of benefits and assistance available  under the Program shall not be considered as income or resources of  recipients and their families for any purpose under   Federal, State or local laws, including, but not limited to, laws  relating to taxation, welfare, and public assistance programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> State requirements. Nothing contained in this part shall prevent  a State agency from imposing additional operating requirements which are  not inconsistent with the provisions of this part, provided that such  additional requirements shall not deny the Program to an area in which  poor economic conditions exist, and shall not result in a significant  number of needy children not having access to the Program. Prior to  imposing any additional requirements, the State agency must receive  approval from FNSRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fraud penalty. Whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals,  or obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject  of a grant or other form of assistance under this part, whether received  directly or indirectly from the Department, or whoever receives,  conceals, or retains such funds, assets, or property to his use or gain,  knowing such funds, assets, or property have been embezzled, willfully  misapplied, stolen or obtained by fraud shall, if such funds, assets, or  property are of the value of $100 or more, be fined not more than  $25,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, or if such  funds, assets, or property are of a value of less than $100, shall be  fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or  both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Claims adjustment authority. The Secretary shall have the  authority to determine the amount of, to settle, and to adjust any claim  arising under the Program, and to compromise or deny such claim or any  part thereof. The Secretary shall also have the authority to waive such  claims if the Secretary determines that to do so would serve the  purposes of the Program. This provision shall not diminish the authority  of the Attorney General of the United States under section 516 of title  28, U.S. Code, to conduct litigation on behalf of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Data collection related to sponsors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each State agency must  collect data related to sponsors that have an agreement with the State  agency to participate in the program for each of Federal fiscal years  2006 through 2009, including those sponsors that participated only for  part of the fiscal year. Such data shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of each sponsor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The city in which each participating sponsor was headquartered  and the name of the state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of funds provided to the participating  organization, i.e., the sum of the amount of federal funds reimbursed  for operating and administrative cost; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The type of participating organization, e.g., government  agency, educational institution, non-profit organization/secular, non- profit organization/faith-based, and ``other.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or before August 31, 2007, and each subsequent year through  2010, State agencies must report to FNS data as specified in paragraph  (i)(1) of this section for the prior Federal fiscal year. State agencies  must submit this data in a format designated by FNS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Program evaluations. States, State agencies, sponsors, sites and  contractors must cooperate in studies and evaluations conducted by or on  behalf of the Department, related to programs authorized under the  Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act  of 1966, as amended.
