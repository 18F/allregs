This part establishes procedures under which a plan  sponsor shall request the PBGC to approve a plan amendment under section  4220 of ERISA. This part applies to all multiemployer plans covered by  title IV of ERISA that adopt amendments pursuant to the authorization of  sections 4201-4219 of ERISA (except for amendments adopted pursuant to  section 4211(c)(5)). (The covered amendments are set forth in paragraph  (b) of this section.) The subsequent modification of a plan amendment  adopted by authorization of those sections is also covered by this part.  This part does not, however, cover a plan amendment that merely repeals  a previously adopted amendment, returning the plan to the statutorily  prescribed rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Covered amendments.
