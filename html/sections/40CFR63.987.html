Flares subject to this subpart shall meet the performance requirements in 40 CFR 63.11(b) (General Provisions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flare compliance assessment. (1) The owner or operator shall conduct an initial flare compliance assessment of any flare used to comply with the provisions of this subpart. Flare compliance assessment records shall be kept as specified in Sec.  63.998(a)(1) and a flare compliance assessment report shall be submitted as specified in Sec.  63.999(a)(2).
