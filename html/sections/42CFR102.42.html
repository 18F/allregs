                                Sec.  102.42  Deadlines for filing request forms.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Filing deadlines vary depending on whether the injured individual is a smallpox vaccine recipient or a vaccinia contact. In all cases, the filing date is the date the Request Form is postmarked. A legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier, a private courier service, or the U.S. Postal Service (e.g., the date that a commercial carrier places on the package at the time of drop-off) will be considered equivalent to a postmark. A Request Form will not be considered filed unless it has been completed (to the fullest extent possible) and signed by the requester or his or her representative. After filing a Request Form within the governing filing deadline, a requester can and should update the Request Form to reflect new information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request forms not filed within deadline. If the Secretary determines that a Request Form was not filed within the governing filing deadline set out in this section, the Request Form will not be processed and the requester will not be entitled to any benefits under this Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Smallpox vaccine recipients. All Request Forms filed by, or on behalf of, a smallpox vaccine recipient must be filed within one year of the date of the administration of a smallpox vaccine to the smallpox vaccine recipient. This deadline also applies to a deceased smallpox vaccine recipient's survivor(s) and the representative of his or her estate. This deadline applies to Request Forms concerning injuries resulting from the administration of a smallpox vaccine or other covered countermeasures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vaccinia contacts. All Request Forms filed by, or on behalf of, a vaccinia contact must be filed within two years after the date of the first symptom or manifestation of onset of the covered injury in the vaccinia contact. This deadline also applies to a deceased vaccinia contact's survivor(s) and the representative of his or her estate. This deadline applies to Request Forms concerning injuries resulting from vaccinia contracted through accidental vaccinia inoculation or from the administration of covered countermeasures (other than the smallpox vaccine) as a result of such accidental vaccinia inoculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request forms (or amendments to request forms) based on modifications to the table of injuries. The Secretary may amend the Table set forth in Sec.  102.21. The effect of such an amendment may enable a requester who previously could not establish a Table injury to establish a Table injury. In such circumstances, the requester must file a new Request Form or an amendment to a previously filed Request Form as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the injured person is a smallpox vaccine recipient, within one year after the effective date of the amendment to the Table; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the injured person is a vaccinia contact, within two years after the effective date of the amendment to the Table.</p>
