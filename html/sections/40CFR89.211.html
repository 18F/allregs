                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> End-of-year and final reports must indicate the engine family, the actual applicable production/sales volume, the values required to calculate credits as given in Sec. 89.207, and the number of credits generated/required. Manufacturers must also submit how and where credit surpluses were dispersed (or are to be banked) and/or how and through what means credit deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to credit trading must be included or supplied by the broker, if applicable. The report shall include a calculation of credit balances to show that the summation of the manufacturer's use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or greater than zero, except as allowed under Sec. 89.203(c)(3)(ii). Manufacturers participating under the program described in Sec. 89.203(c)(3)(ii) shall include the NMHC + NOX credit balance and the PM credit balance as of December 31 of that calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicable production/sales volume for end-of-year and final reports must be based on the location of the point of first retail sale (for example, retail customer, dealer, secondary manufacturer) also called the final product purchase location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final reports must be submitted within 270 days of the end of the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure by a manufacturer participating in the averaging, banking, or

trading program to submit any end-of-year or final reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A manufacturer generating credits for deposit only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90 days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected in the final report up to 270 days from the end of the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year or final report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If within 270 days of the end of the model year, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the model year, the credits shall be restored for use by the manufacturer.
