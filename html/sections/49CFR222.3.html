This part also provides standards for the creation and maintenance of quiet zones within which locomotive horns need not be sounded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. If any provision is stayed or determined to be invalid, it is the intent of FRA that the remaining provisions shall continue in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part does not apply to any Chicago Region highway-rail grade crossing where the railroad was excused from sounding the locomotive horn by the Illinois Commerce Commission, and where the railroad did not sound the horn, as of December 18, 2003.</p>
