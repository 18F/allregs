                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section carries out section 6 of the Act. Under  section 6 of the Act, each museum or Federal agency that has possession  or control over collections which may contain unassociated funerary  objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must complete  a summary of these collections based upon available information held by  the museum or Federal agency. The purpose of the summary is to provide  information about the collections to lineal descendants and culturally  affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that may wish  to request repatriation of such objects. The summary serves in lieu of  an object-by-object inventory of these collections, although, if an  inventory is available, it may be substituted. Federal agencies are  responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for all  collections from their lands or generated by their actions whether the  collections are held by the Federal agency or by a non-Federal  institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of summaries. For each collection or portion of a  collection, the summary must include: an estimate of the number of  objects in the collection or portion of the collection; a description of  the kinds of objects included; reference to the means, date(s), and  location(s) in which the collection or portion of the collection was  acquired, where readily ascertainable; and information relevant to  identifying lineal descendants, if available, and cultural affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Completion. Summaries must be completed not later than November  16, 1993.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consultation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consulting parties. Museum and Federal agency  officials must consult with Indian tribe officials and traditional  religious leaders:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> From whose tribal lands unassociated funerary objects, sacred  objects, or objects of cultural patrimony originated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with  unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural  patrimony; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> From whose aboriginal lands unassociated funerary objects,  sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony originated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initiation of consultation. Museum and Federal agency officials  must begin summary consultation no later than the completion of the  summary process. Consultation may be initiated with a letter, but should  be followed up by telephone or face-to-face dialogue with the  appropriate Indian tribe official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provision of information. During summary consultation, museum  and Federal agency officials must provide copies of the summary to  lineal descendants, when known, and to officials and traditional  religious leaders representing Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian  organizations that are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with  the cultural items. A copy of the summary must also be provided to the  Manager, National NAGPRA Program. Upon request by lineal descendants or  Indian tribe officials, museum and Federal agency officials must provide  lineal descendants, Indian tribe officials and traditional religious  leaders with access to records, catalogues, relevant studies, or other  pertinent data for the limited purposes of determining the geographic  origin, cultural affiliation, and basic facts surrounding acquisition  and accession of objects covered by the summary. Access to this  information may be requested at any time and must be provided in a  reasonable manner to   be agreed upon by all parties. The Review committee also must be  provided access to such materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for information. During the summary consultation,  museum and Federal agency officials must request, as appropriate, the  following information from Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations that are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with  their collections:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the Indian tribe official to act as  representative in consultations related to particular objects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recommendations on how the consultation process should be  conducted, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Names and appropriate methods to contact any lineal descendants,  if known, of individuals whose unassociated funerary objects or sacred  objects are included in the summary;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Names and appropriate methods to contact any traditional  religious leaders that the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization  thinks should be consulted regarding the collections; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Kinds of cultural items that the Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization considers to be funerary objects, sacred objects,  or objects of cultural patrimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Using summaries to determine affiliation. Museum and Federal  agency officials must document in the summary the following information.  They must use this information in determining, as appropriate, the  lineal descendants of a deceased Native American individual with whom  unassociated funerary objects and sacred objects are affiliated, and the  Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations with which unassociated  funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are  affiliated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accession and catalogue entries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information related to the acquisition of unassociated funerary  object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the person or organization from whom the object was  obtained, if known;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of acquisition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The place each object was acquired, i.e., name or number of  site, county, State, and Federal agency administrative unit, if  applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The means of acquisition, i.e., gift, purchase, or excavation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of each unassociated funerary object, sacred  object, or object of cultural patrimony, including dimensions,  materials, and photographic documentation, if appropriate, and the  antiquity of such objects, if known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary of the evidence used to determine the cultural  affiliation of the unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or  objects of cultural patrimony pursuant to Sec. 10.14 of these  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification. Repatriation of unassociated funerary objects,  sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony to lineal descendants,  culturally affiliated Indian tribes, or Native Hawaiian organizations as  determined pursuant to Sec. 10.10 (a), must not proceed prior to  submission of a notice of intent to repatriate to the Manager, National  NAGPRA Program, and publication of the notice of intent to repatriate in  the Federal Register. The notice of intent to repatriate must describe  the unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of  cultural patrimony being claimed in sufficient detail so as to enable  other individuals, Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations to  determine their interest in the claimed objects. It must include  information that identifies each claimed unassociated funerary object,  sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony and the circumstances  surrounding its acquisition, and describes the objects that are clearly  identifiable as to cultural affiliation. It must also describe the  objects that are not clearly identifiable as being culturally affiliated  with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, but  which, given the totality of circumstances surrounding acquisition of  the objects, are likely to be culturally affiliated with a particular  Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. The Manager, National  NAGPRA Program must publish the notice of intent to repatriate in the  Federal Register. Repatriation may not occur until at least thirty (30)  days after publication of the   notice of intent to repatriate in the Federal Register.
