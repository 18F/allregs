The  petition must be submitted in duplicate not later than 3 days before  expiration of the time stated in the notice. The filing of the petition  does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary grants the petition only if the petitioner shows a  substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the  extension, and if the extension is in the public interest. If an  extension is granted, it is granted as to all persons and is published  in the Federal Register.</p>
