References in this subchapter to ``a combination of cost and price analysis'' relating to the applicability of policy and contract clauses refer to comprehensive medical plan carriers using community rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted community rate means a community rate which has been adjusted for expected use of medical resources of the FEHBP group. An adjusted community rate is a prospective rate and cannot be retroactively revised to reflect actual experience, utilization, or costs of the FEHBP group, except as described in Sec.  1615.402(c)(4).
