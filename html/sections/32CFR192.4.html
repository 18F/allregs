                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy that under DoD Directive 1350.2 \1\ the Department of Defense is fully committed to the goal of obtaining equal treatment for all DoD personnel. Specific guidance on off-base housing and fair housing enforcement is as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Copies of all DoD issuances listed in this part may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> National Housing Policy. Federal law prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title VIII of P.L. 90-284 contains the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fair housing provisions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with regard to Public Law 90-284.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requires all Executive Departments and Agencies to administer housing and urban development programs and activities under their jurisdiction in a manner that shall reflect ``affirmatively'' the furthering of title VIII.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title IX of Public Law 90-284 makes it a crime to intimidate willfully or interfere with any person by force or threat because of that person's activities in support of fair housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Title 42 U.S.C. 1982 prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States. This statute protects DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public Law 100-430 amends title VIII of Public Law 90-284 by revising the procedures for the enforcement of fair housing requirements and adding protected classes of individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Title VIII of Public Law 90-284, as amended by Public Law 100-430, does not limit the applicability of any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Additionally, provisions of such title VIII regarding familial status do not apply with respect to housing intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older or intended and operated for occupancy, but at least one person 55 years of age or older. For guidance regarding housing occupied by those 55 years of age or older, use the statutory provision at section 805 b(2)(c), 102 Stat. 1623, of Public Law 100-430.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DoD Fair Housing Policy. The Department of Defense intends that Federal fair housing law shall be supported and that DoD personnel shall have equal opportunity for available housing regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That policy includes the objective of eliminating discrimination against DoD personnel in off-base housing. That objective is not achieved simply by finding a place to live in a particular part of town or in a particular facility for a specific person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The intent is achieved when a person meeting the ordinary standards of character and financial responsibility is able to obtain off-base housing equally as any other person anywhere in the area surrounding a military installation, without suffering discrimination based on race, color, religion,

sex, age, national origin, handicap or familial status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The accomplishment of this objective shall not be hampered by requiring the submission of a formal complaint of discrimination. A suspected discriminatory act, with or without the filing of a formal complaint, is a valid basis for investigation and, if discrimination is substantiated, imposition of restrictive sanctions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On substantiation that an agent practiced discrimination, restrictive sanctions shall be imposed for a minimum of 180 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fact that Public Law 90-284, 42 U.S.C. 1982, and Public Law 100-430 may or may not provide a remedy in a given case of discrimination affecting DoD personnel does not relieve a commander of the responsibility to ensure equal treatment and equal opportunity for such personnel or to impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and/or facility, when appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Military installations shall develop information programs to apprise Service members of the DoD policy and program for equal opportunity in off-base housing. Commanders should use local community resources, such as civil rights organizations, religious and service groups, and local information media, in support of their programs.
