                            <p class="depth0">The board of directors of the merging federal credit union must certify the results of the membership vote to the Regional Director within 10 days after the vote is taken. The certification must include the total number of members of record of the credit union, the number who voted on the merger, the number who voted in favor, and the number who voted against. If the continuing credit union is nonfederally-insured, the merging credit union must use the certification form in subpart C of this part unless the Regional Director approves the use of a different form.
