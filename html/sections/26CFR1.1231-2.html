                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of cattle, horses, or other livestock acquired by  the taxpayer after December 31, 1969, section 1231 applies to the sale,  exchange, or involuntary conversion of such cattle, horses, or other  livestock, regardless of age, held by the taxpayer for draft, breeding,  dairy, or sporting purposes, and held by him:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For 24 months or more from the date of acquisition in the case  of cattle or horses, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For 12 months or more from the date of acquisition in the case  of such other livestock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of livestock (including cattle or horses) acquired  by the taxpayer on or before December 31, 1969, section 1231 applies to  the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of such livestock,  regardless of age, held by the taxpayer for draft, breeding, or dairy  purposes, and held by him for 12 months or more from the date of  acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of section 1231, the term livestock is given a  broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation and includes cattle, hogs,  horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, goats, fur-bearing animals, and other  mammals. However, it does not include poultry, chickens, turkeys,  pigeons, geese, other birds, fish, frogs, reptiles, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether or not livestock is held by the taxpayer for draft,  breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes depends upon all of the facts and  circumstances in each case. The purpose for which the animal is held is  ordinarily shown by the taxpayer's actual   use of the animal. However, a draft, breeding, dairy, or sporting  purpose may be present if an animal is disposed of within a reasonable  time after its intended use for such purpose is prevented or made  undesirable by reason of accident, disease, drought, unfitness of the  animal for such purpose, or a similar factual circumstance. Under  certain circumstances, an animal held for ultimate sale to customers in  the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business may be  considered as held for draft, breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes.  However, an animal is not held by the taxpayer for draft, breeding,  dairy, or sporting purposes merely because it is suitable for such  purposes or merely because it is held by the taxpayer for sale to other  persons for use by them for such purposes. Furthermore, an animal held  by the taxpayer for other purposes is not considered as held for draft,  breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes merely because of a negligible use  of the animal for such purposes or merely because of the use of the  animal for such purposes as an ordinary or necessary incident to the  other purposes for which the animal is held. See paragraph (c) of this  section for the rules to be used in determining when horses are held for  racing purposes and, therefore, are considered as held for sporting  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of this paragraph is illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. An animal intended by the taxpayer for use by him for  breeding purposes is discovered to be sterile or unfit for the breeding  purposes for which it was held, and is disposed of within a reasonable  time thereafter. This animal is considered as held for breeding  purposes.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The taxpayer retires from the breeding or dairy business  and sells his entire herd, including young animals which would have been  used by him for breeding or dairy purposes if he had remained in  business. These young animals are considered as held for breeding or  dairy purposes. The same would be true with respect to young animals  which would have been used by the taxpayer for breeding or dairy  purposes but which are sold by him in reduction of his breeding or dairy  herd, because of, for example, drought.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A taxpayer in the business of raising hogs for slaughter  customarily breeds sows to obtain a single litter to be raised by him  for sale, and sells these brood sows after obtaining the litter. Even  though these brood sows are held for ultimate sale to customers in the  ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business, they are considered  as held for breeding purposes.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. A taxpayer in the business of raising horses for sale to  others for use by them as draft horses uses them for draft purposes on  his own farm in order to train them. This use is an ordinary or  necessary incident to the purpose of selling the animals, and,  accordingly, these horses are not considered as held for draft purposes.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. The taxpayer is in the business of raising registered  cattle for sale to others for use by them as breeding cattle. It is the  business practice of this particular taxpayer to breed the offspring of  his herd which he is holding for sale to others prior to sale in order  to establish their fitness for sale as registered breeding cattle. In  such case, the taxpayer's breeding of such offspring is an ordinary and  necessary incident to his holding them for the purpose of selling them  as bred heifers or proven bulls and does not demonstrate that the  taxpayer is holding them for breeding purposes. However, those cattle  held by the taxpayer as additions or replacements to his own breeding  herd to produce calves are considered to be held for breeding purposes,  even though they may not actually have produced calves.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. A taxpayer, engaged in the business of buying cattle and  fattening them for slaughter, purchased cows with calf. The calves were  born while the cows were held by the taxpayer. These cows are not  considered as held for breeding purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a horse held  for racing purposes shall be considered as held for sporting purposes.  Whether a horse is held for racing purposes shall be determined in  accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A horse which has actually been raced at a public race track  shall, except in rare and unusual circumstances, be considered as held  for racing purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A horse which has not been raced at a public track shall be  considered as held for racing purposes if it has been trained to race  and other facts and circumstances in the particular case also indicate  that the horse was held for this purpose. For example, assume that the  taxpayer maintains a written training record on all horses he keeps in  training status, which shows that a   particular horse does not meet objective standards (including, but not  limited to, such considerations as failure to achieve predetermined  standards of performance during training, or the existence of a physical  or other defect) established by the taxpayer for determining the fitness  and quality of horses to be retained in his racing stable. Under such  circumstances, if the taxpayer disposes of the horse within a reasonable  time after he determined that it did not meet his objective standards  for retention, the horse shall be considered as held for racing  purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A horse which has neither been raced at a public track nor  trained for racing shall not, except in rare and unusual circumstances,  be considered as held for racing purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. The taxpayer breeds, raises, and trains horses for the  purpose of racing. Every year he culls some horses from his racing  stable. In 1971, the taxpayer decided that in order to prevent his  racing stable from getting too large to be effectively operated he must  cull six horses from it. All six of the horses culled by the taxpayer  had been raced at public tracks in 1970. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of  this paragraph, all these horses are considered as held for racing  purposes.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further  that the taxpayer decided to cull four more horses from his racing  stable in 1971. All these horses had been trained to race but had not  been raced at public tracks. The taxpayer culled these four horses  because the training log which the taxpayer maintains on all the horses  he trains showed these horses to be unfit to remain in his racing  stable. Horse A was culled because it developed shin splints during  training. Horses B and C were culled because of poor temperament. B  bolted every time a rider tried to mount it, and C became extremely  nervous when it was placed in the starting gate. Horse D was culled  because it did not qualify for retention under one of the objective  standards the taxpayer had established for determining which horses to  retain since it was unable to run a specified distance in a minimum  time. These four horses were disposed of within a reasonable time after  the taxpayer determined that they were unfit to remain in his stable.  Under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, all these horses are  considered as held for racing purposes.  [T.D. 7141, 36 FR 18792, Sept. 22, 1971]</p>
