                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Decision by person other than the responsible Department official. If the hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Department official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient or other party subject to this part. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing officer, the recipient or other party may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Department official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Department official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the recipient or other party a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the responsible Department official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Department official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Decisions on record or review by the responsible Department official. Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible Department official conducts the hearing, the recipient or other party shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in writing to the recipient or other party and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 8.12(a) a decision shall be made by the responsible departmental official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the recipient or other party, and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Ruling required. Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible Department official shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the recipient or other party has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Approval by Secretary. Any final decision of a responsible Department

official (other than the Secretary) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue, Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part of the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue, Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient or other party determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Posttermination proceedings. (1) Any recipient or other party which is adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any recipient or other party adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient or other party has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Department official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the recipient or other party may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. The recipient or other party will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</p>
