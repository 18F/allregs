                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A research institution that conducts extramural research  supported by USDA funds, as the responsible legal entity for the USDA- supported research, has a continuing obligation to create and maintain  adequate records (including documents and other evidentiary matter) as  may be required by any subsequent inquiry, investigation, finding,  adjudication, or other proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever an investigation is initiated, the research institution  must promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody  of all relevant research records and evidence as may be necessary to  conduct the research misconduct proceedings. This must be accomplished  before the research institution notifies the researcher/respondent of  the allegation, or immediately thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The original research records and evidence taken into custody by  the research institution shall be inventoried and stored in a secure  place and manner. Research records involving raw data shall include the  devices or instruments on which they reside. However, if deemed  appropriate by the research institution or investigator, research data  or records that reside on or in instruments or devices may be copied and  removed from those instruments or devices as long as the copies are  complete, accurate, and have substantially equivalent evidentiary value  as the data or records have when the data or records reside on the  instruments or devices. Such copies of data or records shall be made by  a disinterested, qualified technician and not by the subject of the  original allegation or other interested parties. When the relevant data  or records have been removed from the devices or instruments, the  instruments or devices need not be maintained as evidence.</p>
