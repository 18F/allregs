                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 5323(j)(2) of Title 49 United States Code provides that  the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(1) shall not apply in four  specific instances. This section sets out the conditions for the three  statutory waivers based on public interest, non-availability, and price- differential. Section 661.11 of this part sets out the conditions for  the fourth statutory waiver governing the procurement of rolling stock  and associated equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the provision of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(A), the  Administrator may waive the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(1)  if the Administrator finds that their application would be inconsistent  with the public interest. In determining whether the conditions exist to  grant this public interest waiver, the Administrator will consider all  appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis, unless a general exception  is specifically set out in this part. When granting a public interest  waiver, the Administrator shall issue a detailed written statement  justifying why the waiver is in the public interest. The Administrator  shall publish this justification in the Federal Register, providing the  public with a reasonable time for notice and comment of not more than  seven calendar days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under the provision of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2), the Administrator  may waive the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) if the  Administrator finds that the materials for which a waiver is requested  are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably  available quantities and of a satisfactory quality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It will be presumed that the conditions exist to grant this non- availability waiver if no responsive and responsible bid is received  offering an item produced in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a sole source procurement, the Administrator will  grant this non-availability waiver only if the grantee provides  sufficient information which indicates that the item to be procured is  only available from a single source or that the item to be procured is  not produced in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a  satisfactory quality in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After contract award, the Administrator may grant a non- availability waiver under this paragraph, in any case in which a bidder  or offeror originally certified compliance with the Buy America  requirements in good faith, but can no longer comply with its  certification. The Administrator will grant a non-availability waiver  only if the grantee provides sufficient evidence that the original  certification was made in good faith and that the   item to be procured cannot now be obtained domestically due to  commercial impossibility or impracticability. In determining whether the  conditions exist to grant a post-award non-availability waiver, the  Administrator will consider all appropriate factors on a case-by-case  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under the provision of section 165(b)(4) of the Act, the  Administrator may waive the general requirements of section 165(a) if  the Administrator finds that the inclusion of a domestic item or  domestic material will increase the cost of the contract between the  grantee and its supplier of that item or material by more than 25  percent. The Administrator will grant this price-differential waiver if  the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid offering the  item or material that is not produced in the United States multiplied by  1.25 is less than the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible  bid offering the item or material produced in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The four statutory waivers of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2) as set out in  this part shall be treated as being separate and distinct from each  other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section  may be granted for a component or subcomponent in the case of the  procurement of the items governed by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(C)  (requirements for rolling stock). If a waiver is granted for a component  or a subcomponent, that component or subcomponent will be considered to  be of domestic origin for the purposes of Sec. 661.11 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section  may be granted for a specific item or material that is used in the  production of a manufactured product that is governed by the  requirements of Sec. 661.5(d) of this part. If such a waiver is granted  to such a specific item or material, that item or material will be  treated as being of domestic origin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The provisions of this section shall not apply to products  produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the  United States Trade Representative, determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That foreign country is party to an agreement with the United  States pursuant to which the head of an agency of the United States has  waived the requirements of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That foreign country has violated the terms of the agreement by  discriminating against products covered by this section that are  produced in the United States and are covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec. 661.7--General Waivers</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All waivers published in 48 CFR 25.104 which establish excepted  articles, materials, and supplies for the Buy American Act of 1933 (41  U.S.C. 10a-d), as the waivers may be amended from time to time, apply to  this part under the provisions of Sec. 661.7 (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and (c) of this part, a  general public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements applies  to microprocessors, computers, microcomputers, or software, or other  such devices, which are used solely for the purpose of processing or  storing data. This general waiver does not extend to a product or device  which merely contains a microprocessor or microcomputer and is not used  solely for the purpose of processing or storing data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under the provisions of Sec. 661.7(b) of this part, a general  public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements for ``small  purchases'' (as defined in the ``common grant rule,'' at 49 CFR  18.36(d)) made by FTA grantees with capital, planning, or operating  assistance.  [56 FR 932, Jan. 9, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 37928, July 24, 1995, 61  FR 6302, Feb. 16, 1996; 71 FR 14117, Mar. 21, 2006; 72 FR 53697, Sept.  20, 2007; 74 FR 30239, June 25, 2009]</p>
