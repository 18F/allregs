                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person receiving official notice of violation of the terms  of the Communications Act, any legislative act, executive order, treaty  to which the United States is a party, terms of a station or operator  license, or the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications  Commission must within 10 days from such receipt, send a written answer,  in duplicate, to the office of the Commission originating the official  notice. If an answer cannot be sent or an acknowledgment made within  such 10-day period by reason of illness or other unavoidable  circumstances, acknowledgment and answer must be made at the earliest  practicable date with a satisfactory explanation of the delay. The  answer to each notice must be complete in itself and must not be  abbreviated by references to other communications or answers to other  notices. The answer must contain a full explanation of the incident  involved and must set forth the action taken to prevent a continuation  or recurrence. If the notice relates to lack of attention to or improper  operation of the station or to log or watch discrepancies, the answer  must give the name and license number of the licensed operator on duty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an official notice of violation, impending violation, or  discrepancy, pertaining to any provision of Part II of Title III of the  Communications Act or the radio provisions of the Safety Convention, is  served upon the master or person responsible for a vessel and any  instructions appearing on such document issued by a representative of  the Commission are at variance with the content of paragraph (a) of this  section, the instructions issued by the Commission's representative  supersede those set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
