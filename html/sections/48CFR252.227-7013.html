                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Computer data base means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.

Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Developed exclusively at private expense means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Developed exclusively with government funds means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished partially with

Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Government purpose rights means the rights to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A release or disclosure to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Technical data means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation).
