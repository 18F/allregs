                                Sec.  16.5  Timing of responses to requests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Components ordinarily will respond to requests  according to their order of receipt. Appendix I to this part contains  the list of the Department components that are designated to accept  requests. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed  pursuant to Sec.  16.4(c), the response time will commence on the date  that the request is received by the proper component's office that is  designated to receive requests, but in any event not later than 10  working days after the request is first received by any component's  office that is designated by these regulations to receive requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multitrack processing. All components must designate a specific  track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance  with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A  component may also designate additional processing tracks that  distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the  estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among  the factors a component may consider are the number of pages involved in  processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals.  Components shall advise requesters of the track into which their request  falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity  to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different  processing track.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for  processing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances,''  as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that  basis, the component shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to  respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances  involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be  expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days,  the component shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester  with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time  period for processing. The component shall make available its designated  FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual  circumstances under the FOIA, components may aggregate requests in cases  where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by  a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a  single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances.  Components shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated  matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals shall be  processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they  involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily  engaged in disseminating information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that  affect public confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.  Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section  must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested.  When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative  appeal, the request should be submitted to OIP. Requests for expedited  processing that are based on paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must  be submitted to the Director of Public Affairs at the Office of Public  Affairs, Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington,  DC 20530-0001. A component that receives a misdirected request for  expedited processing under the standard set forth in paragraph  (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall forward it immediately to the Office of  Public Affairs for its determination. The time period for making the  determination on the request for expedited processing under paragraph  (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall commence on the date that the Office of  Public Affairs receives the request, provided that it is routed within  10 working days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the  basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example,  under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a  full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is  a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is  information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole  occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to  inform the public about the government activity involved in the  request--one that extends beyond the public's right to know about  government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles  published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the  requirement that there be an ``urgency to inform'' the public on the  topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive  the formal certification requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A component shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days  of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision  whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing  is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the  processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon  as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any  appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</p>
