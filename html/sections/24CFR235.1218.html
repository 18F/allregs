                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mortgage amount. It must be in an amount not exceeding the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unpaid principal balance due on the mortgage being  refinanced, including any advances properly made by the mortgagee under  the terms of the mortgage and any current interest due and delinquent  interest not to exceed two months; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The original principal amount of the mortgage being refinanced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maturity date. It must have a maturity not to exceed the  remaining term of the section 235 mortgage being refinanced. In the  event that the remaining term is measured in years and months, the terms  for the refinancing mortgage shall be rounded down to the next whole  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 235(r) interest rate is the rate  negotiated between the parties. Such rate shall not exceed the GNMA  coupon rate plus a margin to be determined by the Secretary. The GNMA  coupon rate is based on the closing price for three-month forward  delivery contracts closest to par but not exceeding par on one of the  following dates, whichever rate is higher:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date the Direct Endorsement mortgagee's underwriter signs  the Mortgage Credit Analysis Worksheet (form HUD-92900 WS); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the mortgage is closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary will pay the mortgagee a discount as part of the  refinancing costs. The maximum discount points will be determined by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a mortgage to be insurable under this subpart, the interest  rate on the mortgage must be less than the interest rate shown on the  mortgage being refinanced. The Secretary shall determine how much less  the interest rate on the mortgage shall be in order for it to be  insured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mortgagors' Incentive and Refinancing Costs. The incentive to  the mortgagors and the refinancing costs   that the Secretary will pay for mortgages insured under this subpart are  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amount determined by the Secretary to be an incentive to the  mortgagor to refinance a mortgage insured under section 235; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts as determined by the Secretary for discounts, loan  origination fees, closing costs, and other costs incurred in connection  with the refinancing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligible mortgagees. The Secretary shall determine whether this  program will be open to all approved Direct Endorsement mortgagees, or  only to those approved Direct Endorsement mortgagees that meet certain  specified requirements. The Secretary may limit the program to a  designated number of Direct Endorsement approved mortgagees if such a  limitation will facilitate the most expeditious handling of these  refinancing mortgages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligible mortgagor. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It must be executed by a mortgagor who  is eligible for, and receiving, assistance payments with respect to the  mortgage being refinanced and from whom a recertification was obtained  within the preceding twelve months prior to the application for the  235(r) mortgage, or a new recertification was required prior to the  execution of the mortgage credit worksheet by the direct endorsement  lender, or the firm commitment was issued by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mortgagor must be an occupant of the property securing the  mortgage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mortgagor has not received payments for the costs of  refinancing or the mortgagor's incentive, nor have such payments been  made on his behalf, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, for a  period of 60 months from the date of the first payment of principal and  interest on the mortgage to be refinanced; provided, however, that if  the mortgagor pays its own cost to refinance, then this prohibition will  not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The mortgagor is eligible to continue to receive assistance in  connection with the 235(r) mortgage, or the mortgagee has executed a HUD  Notice of Suspension form that suspends the assistance payment contract  from the date of disbursement of the mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The mortgagor has agreed to recertify, on a form prescribed by  the Secretary, as to occupancy, employment, family composition and  income in accordance with 24 CFR 235.350.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the property is subject to a recapture mortgage securing the  payment to the Secretary of assistance payments made on behalf of the  mortgagor, the mortgagor must agree to modify and subordinate such  mortgage to the mortgage to be insured under section 235(r) in  accordance with instructions of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the mortgage submitted for insurance requires an increase in  the mortgagor's portion of the monthly payments due under the mortgage  by more than $50.00 over the amount the mortgagor was paying on the  mortgage being refinanced, then a mortgage credit analysis must be  performed on the mortgagor to establish that his income is or will be  adequate to meet his portion of the periodic payment due under the new  mortgage and that the mortgagor has a general credit standing  satisfactory to the Secretary as required by 24 CFR 203.34.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Cooperative members, who are receiving assistance payments,  which in all cases are based on the cooperative member's proportionate  share of the obligation under the project mortgage, are not eligible for  section 235(r) mortgages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Monthly Payments. The mortgage must have monthly principal and  interest payments at the 235(r) interest rate that are less than the  monthly payments of principal and interest on the mortgage being  refinanced.
