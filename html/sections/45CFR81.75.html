                            <p class="depth0">An affidavit is; not inadmissible as such. Unless the presiding  officer fixes other time periods affidavits shall be filed and served on  the parties not later than 15 days prior to the hearing; and not less  than 7 days prior to hearing a party may file and serve written  objection to any affidavit on the ground that he believes it necessary  to test the truth of assertions therein at hearing. In such event the  assertions objected to will not be received in evidence unless the  affiant is made available for cross-examination, or the presiding  officer determines that cross-examination is not necessary for the full  and true disclosure of facts referred to in such assertions.  Notwithstanding any objection, however, affidavits may be considered in  the case of any respondent who waives a hearing.</p>
