                                Sec. 122.62  Modification or revocation and reissuance of permits
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When the Director receives any information (for example, inspects  the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as  required in the permit (see Sec. 122.41), receives a request for  modification or revocation and reissuance under Sec. 124.5, or conducts  a review of the permit file) he or she may determine whether or not one  or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section  for modification or revocation and reissuance or both exist. If cause  exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit  accordingly, subject to the limitations of Sec. 124.5(c), and may  request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified,  only the conditions subject to modification are reopened. If a permit is  revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to  revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. See Sec.  124.5(c)(2). If cause does not exist under this section or Sec. 122.63,  the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit. If a  permit modification satisfies the criteria in Sec. 122.63 for ``minor  modifications'' the permit may be modified without a draft permit or  public review. Otherwise, a draft permit must be prepared and other  procedures in part 124 (or procedures of an approved State program)  followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Causes for modification. The following are causes for  modification but not revocation and reissuance of permits except when  the permittee requests or agrees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alterations. There are material and substantial alterations or  additions to the permitted facility or activity (including a change or  changes in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practice) which  occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of permit  conditions that are different or absent in the existing permit.</p><p class="depth3">Note: Certain reconstruction activities may cause the new source  provisions of Sec. 122.29 to be applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information. The Director has received new information. Permits  may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the  information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than  revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified  the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.  For NPDES general permits (Sec. 122.28) this cause includes any  information indicating that cumulative effects on the environment are  unacceptable. For new source or new discharger NPDES permits Sec. Sec.  122.21, 122.29), this cause shall include any significant information  derived from effluent testing required under Sec. 122.21(k)(5)(vi) or  Sec. 122.21(h)(4)(iii) after issuance of the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New regulations. The standards or regulations on which the  permit was based have been changed by promulgation of amended standards  or regulations or by judicial decision after the permit was issued.  Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For promulgation of amended standards or regulations, when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The permit condition requested to be modified was based on a  promulgated effluent limitation guideline, EPA approved or promulgated  water quality standards, or the Secondary Treatment Regulations under  part 133; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> EPA has revised, withdrawn, or modified that portion of the  regulation or effluent limitation guideline on which the permit  condition was based, or has approved a State action with regard to a  water quality standard on which the permit condition was based; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A permittee requests modification in accordance with Sec. 124.5  within ninety (90) days after Federal Register notice of the action on  which the request is based.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For judicial decisions, a court of competent jurisdiction has  remanded and stayed EPA promulgated regulations or effluent limitation  guidelines, if the remand and stay concern that portion of the  regulations or guidelines on which the permit condition was based and a  request is filed by the permittee in accordance with Sec. 124.5 within  ninety (90) days of judicial remand.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For changes based upon modified State certifications of NPDES  permits, see Sec. 124.55(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compliance schedules. The Director determines good cause exists  for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God,  strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the  permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably  available remedy. However, in no case may an NPDES compliance schedule  be modified to extend beyond an applicable CWA statutory deadline. See  also Sec. 122.63(c) (minor modifications) and paragraph (a)(14) of this  section (NPDES innovative technology).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the permittee has filed a request for a variance under CWA  section 301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), or 316(a) or for  ``fundamentally different factors'' within the time specified in Sec.  122.21 or Sec. 125.27(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 307(a) toxics. When required to incorporate an applicable 307(a)  toxic effluent standard or prohibition (see Sec. 122.44(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reopener. When required by the ``reopener'' conditions in a  permit, which are established in the permit under Sec. 122.44(b) (for  CWA toxic effluent limitations and Standards for sewage sludge use or  disposal, see also Sec. 122.44(c)) or 40 CFR 403.18(e) (Pretreatment  program).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Net limits. Upon request of a permittee who qualifies for  effluent limitations on a net basis under Sec. 122.45(g).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Pretreatment. As necessary under 40 CFR 403.8(e) (compliance  schedule for development of pretreatment program).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Failure to notify. Upon failure of an approved State to notify,  as required by section 402(b)(3), another State whose waters may be  affected by a discharge from the approved State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Non-limited pollutants. When the level of discharge of any  pollutant which is not limited in the permit exceeds the level which can  be achieved by the technology-based treatment requirements appropriate  to the permittee under Sec. 125.3(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Notification levels. To establish a ``notification level'' as  provided in Sec. 122.44(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Compliance schedules. To modify a schedule of compliance to  reflect the time lost during construction of an innovative or  alternative facility, in the case of a POTW which has received a grant  under section 202(a)(3) of CWA for 100% of the costs to modify or  replace facilities constructed with a grant for innovative and  alternative wastewater technology under section 202(a)(2). In no case  shall the compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable  CWA statutory deadline for compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> For a small MS4, to include an effluent limitation requiring  implementation of a minimum control measure or measures as specified in  Sec. 122.34(b) when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permit does not include such measure(s) based upon the  determination that another entity was responsible for implementation of  the requirement(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The other entity fails to implement measure(s) that satisfy the  requirement(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> To correct technical mistakes, such as errors in calculation,  or mistaken interpretations of law made in determining permit  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> When the discharger has installed the treatment technology  considered by the permit writer in setting effluent limitations imposed  under section 402(a)(1) of the CWA and has properly operated and  maintained the facilities but nevertheless has been unable to achieve  those effluent limitations. In this case, the limitations in the  modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually  achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by a  subsequently promulgated effluent limitations guideline).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Nutrient Management Plans. The incorporation of the terms of a  CAFO's nutrient management plan into the terms and conditions of a  general permit when a CAFO obtains coverage under a general permit in  accordance with Sec. Sec. 122.23(h) and 122.28 is not a cause for  modification pursuant to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Land application plans. When required by a permit condition to  incorporate a land application plan for beneficial reuse of sewage  sludge, to revise an existing land application plan, or to add a land  application plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Causes for modification or revocation and reissuance. The  following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a  permit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cause exists for termination under Sec. 122.64, and the  Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director has received notification (as required in the  permit, see Sec. 122.41(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of the permit. A  permit also may be modified to reflect a transfer after the effective  date of an automatic transfer (Sec. 122.61(b)) but will not be revoked  and reissued after the effective date of the transfer except upon the  request of the new permittee.
