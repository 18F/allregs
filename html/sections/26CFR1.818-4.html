                                Sec. 1.818-4  Election with respect to life insurance reserves
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 818(c) permits a life insurance company  issuing contracts with respect to which the life insurance reserves are  computed on one of the recognized preliminary term bases to elect to  revalue such reserves on a net level premium basis for the purpose of  determining the amount which may be taken into account as life insurance  reserves for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code,  other than section 801 (relating   to the definition of a life insurance company). If such an election is  made, the method to be used in making this revaluation of reserves shall  be either the exact revaluation method (as described in section  818(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section) or the approximate  revaluation method (as described in section 818(c)(2) and paragraph  (b)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Revaluation of reserves computed on preliminary term basis. If a  life insurance company makes an election under section 818(c) in the  manner provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the amount to be taken  into account as life insurance reserves with respect to contracts for  which such reserves are computed on a preliminary term basis may be  determined on either of the following bases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exact revaluation method. As if the reserves for all such  contracts had been computed on a net level premium basis (using the same  mortality or morbidity assumptions and interest rates for both the  preliminary term basis and the net level premium basis).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approximate revaluation method. The amount computed without  regard to section 818(c):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Increased by $21 per $1,000 of insurance in force (other than  term insurance) under such contracts, less 2.1 percent of reserves under  such contracts, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Increased by $5 per $1,000 of term insurance in force under  such contracts which at the time of issuance cover a period of more than  15 years, less 0.5 percent of reserves under such contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> and paragraph (b)(2) of this section has life  insurance reserves with respect to both life insurance and  noncancellable accident and health contracts for which such reserves are  computed on a preliminary term basis, it shall use the approximate  revaluation method for all its life insurance reserves other than that  portion of such reserves held with respect to its noncancellable  accident and health contracts, and shall use the exact revaluation  method for all its life insurance reserves held with respect to such  noncancellable accident and health contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reserves subject to recomputation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the first taxable  year for which the election under section 818(c) and paragraph (b) of  this section applies, a company making such election must revalue all  its life insurance reserves held with respect to contracts for which  such reserves are computed on a preliminary term basis at the end of  such taxable year on the basis elected under section 818(c) and  paragraph (b) of this section. However, for purposes of the preceding  sentence, an election under section 818(c) shall not apply with respect  to such reserves which would not be treated as being computed on the  preliminary term basis at the end of such taxable year except for the  provisions of section 810 (a) or (b). See paragraph (c)(2) of Sec.  1.810-2. For example, if S, a life insurance company which computes its  life insurance reserves on a recognized preliminary term basis at the  beginning of the taxable year 1958, strengthens a portion of such  reserves during the taxable year by actually changing to a net level  premium basis in computing such reserves, and then makes the election  under section 818(c) and paragraph (b) of this section for 1958, such  election shall not apply with respect to the strengthened contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any taxable year other than the first taxable year for which  the election under section 818(c) and paragraph (b) of this section  applies, a company making such election must revalue all its life  insurance reserves held with respect to contracts for which such  reserves are computed on a preliminary term basis at the beginning or  end of the taxable year on the basis elected under section 818(c) and  paragraph (b) of this section. For example, if M, a life insurance  company which made a valid outstanding election under section 818(c) in  the manner provided in paragraph (e) of this section for the taxable  year 1959, sells a block of contracts subject to such election on  September 1, 1960, M would value such contracts on the basis elected  under section 818(c) and paragraph (b) of this section on January 1,  1960, for purposes of determining the net decrease or increase in the  sum of the   items described in section 810(c) for the taxable year under section 810  (a) or (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of Sec. 1.810-2 and paragraph (e) of  Sec. 1.810-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election provided by  section 818(c) shall be made in a statement attached to the life  insurance company's income tax return for the first taxable year for  which the company desires the election to apply. The return and  statement must be filed not later than the date prescribed by law  (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable  year. However, if the last day prescribed by law (including extensions  thereof) for filing a return for the first taxable year for which the  company desires the election to apply falls before April 4, 1961, the  election provided by section 818(c) may be made for such year by filing  the statement and an amended return for such taxable year (and all  subsequent taxable years for which returns have been filed) before July  4, 1961. The statement shall indicate whether the exact or the  approximate method of revaluation has been adopted. The statement shall  also set forth sufficient information as to mortality and morbidity  asumptions; interest rates; the valuation method used; the amount of the  reserves and the amount and type of insurance in force under all  contracts for which reserves are computed on a preliminary term basis;  and such other pertinent data as will enable the Commissioner to  determine the correctness of the application of the revaluation method  adopted and the accuracy of the computations involved in revaluing the  reserves. The election to use either the exact revaluation method or the  approximate revaluation method shall, except for the purposes of section  801, be adhered to in making the computations under part I for the  taxable year for which such election is made and for all subsequent  taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scope of election. An election made under section 818(c) and  paragraph (b) of this section to use either the exact or the approximate  method of revaluing the company's life insurance reserves shall be  binding for the taxable year for which made, and, except as provided in  paragraph (g) of this section, shall be binding for all succeeding  taxable years, unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from  the Commissioner. However, for taxable years beginning prior to April 4,  1961, a company may revoke the election provided by section 818(c)  without obtaining consent from the Commissioner by filing, before July  4, 1961, a statement that the company desires to revoke such election.  An amended return reflecting such revocation must accompany the  statement for all taxable years for which returns have been filed with  respect to such election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rule for 1958. If an election is made for a taxable year  beginning in 1958 to use the approximate revaluation method described in  section 818(c)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section the company may,  for its first taxable year beginning after 1958, elect to change to the  exact revaluation method described in section 818(c)(1) and paragraph  (b)(1) of this section without obtaining the consent of the  Commissioner. In such case, the election to change shall be made in a  statement attached to the company's income tax return for such taxable  year and filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including  extensions thereof) for filing the return for such year. The statement  shall indicate that the company has elected to change from the  approximate to the exact revaluation method for such taxable year and  shall include such information and data referred to in paragraph (e) of  this section as will enable the Commissioner to determine the  correctness and accuracy of the computations involved.
