                                Sec. 168.75  Procedures for exporting unregistered pesticides--purchaser
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how EPA interprets and will enforce  requirements of FIFRA section 17(a)(2). Section 17(a)(2) provides that  any person exporting a pesticide other than a pesticide registered for  use under FIFRA section 3 or sold under FIFRA section 6(a)(1), shall  obtain a statement signed by the foreign purchaser prior to export,  acknowledging that the purchaser understands that such pesticide is not  registered for use in the United States and cannot be sold in the United  States. Section 17(a)(2) requires that a copy of the statement be  transmitted to an appropriate official of the government of the  importing country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> if, prior to export of the pesticide, the exporter  submits to EPA a statement signed by the foreign purchaser which affirms  that the purchaser is aware that the pesticide is not registered for use  in the United States and cannot be sold for use in the United States.  The exporter must also include with the submission of the purchaser  acknowledgement statement to EPA, a certification signed by the exporter  affirming that the export did not occur until the statement signed by  the foreign purchaser was obtained by the exporter. Except as provided  in paragraph (b) of this section, all pesticide products produced for  export which cannot be sold for use in the United States in the form  that they are produced for export, are considered to be unregistered  pesticides. This includes pesticides which are of a different  formulation, including composition (except for variation within  certified limits), or type of formulation, and pesticides which are  packaged for use patterns for which they are not registered, which may  be evidenced by package type or label use statements. This also includes  unregistered products which are under development as pesticidal products  and which are being exported for research testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. Under the specific circumstances discussed below,  EPA will not treat a registered product which has been modified slightly  for export purposes, as unregistered for the purposes of the purchaser  acknowledgement statement requirement. Any changes to the registered  product for export purposes must be documented in accordance with the  record-keeping requirements at Sec. 169.2 of this chapter and this  policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Labeling on immediate product. EPA will not treat as  unregistered for the purposes of section 17(a)(2), a registered  pesticide product which cannot be sold or distributed for use in the  United   States because its immediate product container does not bear a label  approved under a FIFRA section 3 registration, but which could be sold  or distributed in the United States with the approved label attached to  the immediate product container, provided that the label and labeling  approved under a current FIFRA section 3 registration for the product is  either attached to the immediate product container or accompanies the  product at all times as supplemental labeling as provided in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Packaging. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain changes may be made to a product's  labeling or packaging without affecting the registration status of the  product, as specified in Sec. 152.46(b) of this chapter and this  policy. These changes include any changes in package size and label net  contents, provided no change in use directions or requirement for child- resistant packaging would be necessary for the product to be registered  for use in the United States. For example, if child-resistant packaging  is required for a particular pesticide product in the United States, and  the product will be exported without child-resistant packaging, the  product would be considered unregistered and therefore subject to all  the requirements of FIFRA section 17(a), as described in Sec. 168.75 of  this chapter including the requirement for a purchaser acknowledgement  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an exporter needed to repackage a product in a size to meet  a foreign purchaser's specifications, that modification would not affect  the registration status of the export product. Other modifications to  the label used for export purposes which will not affect the export  product's registration status are: the use of metric units for net  contents, dosages, and other numeric expressions; the use of a different  format for the label, provided that the information does not contradict  the U.S. label; revision of non-mandatory U.S. label statements,  consistent with 40 CFR part 156, including additions or changes required  by other Federal statutes or regulations; a change of the name or  address of the registrant, except for a change resulting from transfer  of ownership, which requires that a registrant keep his name and address  current with the Agency; and any correction of typographical or printing  errors that appeared on the U.S. labeling. (See Sec. 152.46(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labeling statements. The following statements which appear on  any of the product labels or labeling will not affect the status of the  product, provided that they do not contradict the approved FIFRA section  3 labeling:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is permissible to add explanatory language which accurately  explains the meaning of a use classification. For example, the statement  ``restricted use pesticide'' may be expanded to read: ``Restricted in  the United States of America to use by certified applicators'' or  ``Restricted Use Pesticide. In The United States this product is  restricted to use by applicators determined by each state to be  competent in pesticide application and the human health and  environmental consequences of misuse.'' If the explanatory language  falsely represents or is misleading regarding the U.S. use  classification, the product will be considered misbranded. In addition,  a use classification can only be listed if one has been assigned  pursuant to the U.S. registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exporter who is also the manufacturer of a U.S. registered  pesticide may add new uses to the label of that product for export  purposes, without triggering the requirements of section 17(a)(2), as  long as the new uses are within the same general use patterns as those  for the registered product. The general pesticide use patterns are:  terrestrial food crop and terrestrial non-food crop; greenhouse food  crop and greenhouse nonfood crop; aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood  crop' indoor use' and forestry use. Adding new uses to the label which  change the use pattern, such as changes from nonfood to food use,  outdoor to indoor use, or terrestrial to aquatic use, render the product  unregistered and subject to the requirements of section 17 for  unregistered products. If the new use added to the label is a food or  feed use, a tolerance must already be established for the use of that  pesticide in or on that commodity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Composition. EPA will not treat a registered product as  unregistered for the purposes of the purchaser acknowledgement statement  requirement under the following specific circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The formula of the exported product is within certified limits  of the formula of the U.S. registered product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exporter, who is also the manufacturer of a U.S. registered  pesticide, may decrease the percentage of the active ingredient(s) of  that product by adding a List 4 inert ingredient, without causing the  product to be treated as ``unregistered'' and triggering the requirement  to obtain a purchaser acknowledgement statement as a condition for  export. In EPA's Policy Statement on Inert Ingredients in Pesticide  Products, EPA included inert ingredients on List 4-a list of inert  ingredients posing minimal hazard or risk-if the inert ingredients were  generally regarded as innocuous. The provisions of this paragraph do not  apply to those pesticide products intended for public health uses which  are required or conditionally required to submit efficacy data pursuant  to Sec. 158.400 or Sec. 161.640 of this chapter, as applicable. Any  differences in formula or composition caused by adding a List 4 inert  must be reflected in records which show the complete formula of the  export product in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 169.2 and  this policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change in the color or fragrance of the export product will  not affect the product's registration status as long as the following  conditions are met. The change in color must result only from the  addition of a dye included on the list of the chemicals exempted from  the requirement of a tolerance at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and  180.950, and the dye must not be a List 1 inert. (List 1 inerts are  those inerts which the Agency has identified as presenting toxicological  concerns. The classification of inerts is explained in EPA's Policy  Statement on Inert Ingredients in Pesticide Products. The change in  fragrance must result only from the addition of a chemical included on  the list of the chemicals exempted from the requirement of a tolerance  at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and 180.950, and the chemical must  not be a List 1 inert. The change in fragrance must not result in a  pesticide product containing a food or food-like fragrance. (See ``Food  Fragrances in Pesticide Formulations,'' EPA's Office of Pesticide  Programs Policy and Criteria Notice number 2155.1, November 20, 1975.)  Any difference in color or fragrance of the export product in accordance  with this section must be reflected in records which show the complete  formula of the export product in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 169.2 and this policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Research and development products. An unregistered pesticide  product exported only for research and development purposes is subject  to the notification requirements of this section, unless its use fits  within the criteria described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An unregistered pesticide product exported solely for research  and development purposes will not be considered to be in violation of  the notification requirements if the export of the research and  development product:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Would not involve land uses of more than 10 acres (4.05  hectares), or be used on or affect food or feed crops which are intended  for consumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Would not involve aquatic uses of more than 1 acre (0.405  hectares), or any aquatic uses which involve water used for irrigation,  drinking or recreation, or be used on or affect plants or animals taken  for food or feed from such waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Would not involve tests on animals intended for food or feed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shipments to different purchasers, to different countries of  final destination, or which occur more than a calendar year apart will  be evaluated separately. When determining whether total shipments exceed  the criteria described in this paragraph, EPA will evaluate the total  amount of shipments by a single exporter during a calendar year for use  in a particular country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An exporter bears the burden of demonstrating that the product  meets these criteria before the research product is shipped. This may be  met by documenting before the product is shipped and maintaining records  for the time period required by Sec. 169.2(h) of this   chapter from the date of the last shipment relevant to such records. The  records to be maintained consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The identity of the purchaser and country of intended use of the  research product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount shipped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The intended research use by the purchaser, including the type  of application site, rate of application, and measures taken for  protection of humans from direct or dietary exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contents of the purchaser acknowledgement statements. The  purchaser acknowledgement statement must include the following  information in a format that is clearly understandable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, and EPA identification number, if applicable, of  the exporter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of the foreign purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identity of the product and the active ingredient(s),  including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) Registry number for each  active ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The chemical nomenclature for each active ingredient as used by  the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other known chemical or common names; or if the export involves  a research product, a code name or identification number that can be  used by EPA to identify the product from the exporter's records. If a  code name or identification number is used, additional information must  be attached to the certification statement submitted with the purchaser  acknowledgement statement which will enable EPA to identify the product.  This attached information may be claimed as confidential, and EPA will  not forward this information with the purchaser acknowledgement  statement to foreign governments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If known or reasonably ascertainable, the country or countries  of final destination of the export shipment, i.e., where the exported  pesticide is intended to be used, if different from the country of the  foreign purchaser's address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement that indicates that the foreign purchaser  understands that the product is not registered for use in the United  States and cannot be sold in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The signature of the foreign purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The date of the foreign purchaser's signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this  section is applicable, each shipment which does not meet the  requirements of that paragraph will be considered to be a separate  violation of FIFRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Per-shipment purchaser acknowledgment statement. Unless the  exporter chooses to follow the procedures described in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section for the annual reporting procedures, the  exporter must obtain and submit to EPA, a signed purchaser  acknowledgement statement prior to each shipment of an unregistered  pesticide according to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prior to each shipment in a calendar year of an unregistered  pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a foreign country, the  exporter must provide the foreign purchaser with instructions about the  required information on a purchaser acknowledgement   statement, and inform the foreign purchaser that the pesticide product  cannot be exported from the United States until the exporter has  received from the foreign purchaser a properly completed, signed, and  dated acknowledgment statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The exporter must obtain, prior to each shipment in a calendar  year of an unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a  foreign country, a signed purchaser acknowledgment statement which  contains the information set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The exporter must sign a statement certifying that export did  not take place until a signed purchaser acknowledgement statement was  received. The exporter must also specify the chemical identity of any  research product which is referred to by code in the purchaser  acknowledgement statement. The information regarding the specific  identity of research products, which may be included in the statement or  consist of an attachment to the certification, may be claimed as  confidential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The exporter must submit the signed acknowledgement statement  from the foreign purchaser, and the accompanying certification by the  exporter including attachments, to EPA within 7 working days of the  exporter's receipt of the purchaser acknowledgement statement, or by the  date of export, whichever occurs first. This information must be  transmitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing  Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b),  Attention: Purchaser Acknowledgement Statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annual reporting procedures. Unless the exporter chooses to  follow the per-shipment reporting option described in paragraph  (c)(2)(i) of this section, the exporter must follow the procedures for  annual summary reporting which include the requirement of a purchaser  acknowledgement statement for the first shipment each calendar year of  an unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser, and an  annual summary of shipments to that purchaser. The annual summary  reporting procedures are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prior to the first shipment each calendar year of an  unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a foreign  country, the exporter must provide the foreign purchaser with  instructions about the required information on a purchaser  acknowledgement statement, and inform the foreign purchaser that the  pesticide product cannot be exported from the United States until the  exporter has received from the foreign purchaser a properly completed,  signed, and dated purchaser acknowledgement statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The exporter must obtain, prior to the first shipment each  calendar year of an unregistered pesticide product to a particular  purchaser in a foreign country, a signed purchaser acknowledgement  statement which contains the information set forth in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The exporter must sign a statement certifying that export did  not take place until a signed purchaser acknowledgement statement was  received, indicating that this statement is for the first shipment to a  particular purchaser in a specific country for that calendar year, and  that the exporter will meet all the purchaser acknowledgement statement  requirements as described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  The exporter must also specify the chemical identity of any research  product which is referred to by code in the purchaser acknowledgement  statement. The information regarding the specific identity of research  products, which may be included in the statement or consist of an  attachment to the certification, may be claimed as confidential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The exporter must submit the signed acknowledgement statement  from the foreign purchaser, and the accompanying certification by the  exporter including attachments, to EPA within 7 working days of the  exporter's receipt of the purchaser acknowledgement statement, or by the  date of export, whichever occurs first. This information must be  transmitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing  Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b),  Attention: Purchaser Acknowledgement Statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The exporter, who has chosen to comply with the requirements of  this paragraph instead of providing per-shipment purchaser  acknowledgement statements in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section, must submit an annual summary report to EPA. An annual  summary report is required for each unregistered pesticide exported  within the preceding calendar year. The report must be in writing,  signed by the exporter, and include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and EPA identification number if applicable, of  the exporter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Name and address of the foreign purchaser, and the date the  purchaser acknowledgement statement, submitted to EPA during the  previous calendar year, was signed by the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The identity of the product and the active ingredients,  including: the Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) registry number for each  active ingredient, the chemical nomenclature for each active ingredient  used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC),  and other known chemical or common names, or if the export involves a  research product, the code name or identification number that can be  used by EPA to identify the product from the exporter's records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The dates of each shipment of the pesticide exported to the  foreign purchaser during that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If known, or reasonably ascertainable, the country or countries  of final destination of the export shipments, i.e., where the exported  pesticide was intended to be used, if different from the foreign  purchaser's address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The exporter shall submit the annual summary no later than March  1st of the following calendar year. The annual summary shall be sent to  the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the  appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b), Attention:  Annual Summary of Exports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Confidentiality claims. Persons submitting the information  specified in the purchaser acknowledgement statement may assert a claim  of business confidentiality by marking the information claimed  confidential as ``FIFRA Confidential Business Information.'' Information  so claimed will not be disclosed, with the exception of disclosure to  the foreign governments, except in accordance with the procedures set  forth in 40 CFR part 2, 7 U.S.C. 136(h), and this policy statement. If  such claim is not asserted, EPA may disclose the information to the  public without providing further notice prior to disclosure or an  opportunity to object. Notwithstanding any claim of confidentiality, the  purchaser acknowledgement statement will continue to be forwarded to the  appropriate foreign government officials in its entirety, as required by  section 17(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of  this chapter, the following records must be maintained:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> and (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of the certification from the exporter; and copies of  any accompanying information regarding the identity of coded R&D;  products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Agency transmission of purchaser acknowledgement statements. EPA  will transmit a copy of each purchaser acknowledgement statement to the  appropriate government official in each of the intended destination  countries. After receipt of the Annual Summary the following calendar  year, EPA will also transmit a copy of that document to the appropriate  government official in each of the intended destination countries. In  the case that no Annual   Summary has been received within 30 days of the date at which such  summary is required to be submitted, EPA will send written notification  to the appropriate government official indicating that no summary was  submitted, and may also take enforcement action against the exporter.
