of the system being checked. The analyzer flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the in-use flow rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and valve V2 (see Figure 1 in appendix B of this subpart) may be excluded from the leak check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure side leak check. Substantial leaks of the sample on the pressure side of the system may impact sample integrity if the leaks are of sufficient magnitude. As a safety precaution, it is good engineering practice to perform periodic pressure side leak checks on the sampling system.</p>
