                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in this section, a futures  commission merchant must at all times maintain in a separate account or  accounts money, securities and property in an amount at least sufficient  to cover or satisfy all of its obligations to 30.7 customers denominated  as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount. In computing  the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, a futures  commission merchant may offset any net deficit in a particular 30.7  customer's account against the current market value of readily  marketable securities held for the same particular 30.7 customer's  account as provided for in paragraph (l) of this section. The amount  that must be deposited in such separate account or accounts for 30.7  customers must be no less than the amount required to be held in a  separate account or accounts for or on behalf of 30.7 customers pursuant  to any law, or rule, regulation or order thereunder, or any rule of any  self-regulatory organization authorized thereunder, in the jurisdiction  in which the depository or the 30.7 customer, as appropriate, is  located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Location of 30.7 customer funds. A futures commission merchant  shall deposit the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount  under an account name that clearly identifies the funds as belonging to  30.7 customers and shows that the foreign futures or foreign options  secured amount is set aside as required by this part. A futures  commission merchant may deposit funds set aside as the foreign futures  or foreign options secured amount with the following depositories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A bank or trust company located in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A bank or trust company located outside the United States that  has in excess of $1 billion of regulatory capital;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A futures commission merchant registered as such with the  Commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A derivatives clearing organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The clearing organization of any foreign board of trade;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A member of any foreign board of trade; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Such member's or clearing organization's designated  depositories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on holding foreign futures or foreign options secured  amount outside of the United States. A futures commission merchant may  not deposit or hold the foreign futures or foreign options secured  amount in accounts maintained outside of the United States with any of  the depositories listed in paragraph (b) of this section except to meet  margin requirements, including prefunding margin requirements,  established by rule, regulation, or order of foreign boards of trade or  foreign clearing organizations, or to meet margin calls issued by  foreign brokers carrying the 30.7 customers' foreign futures and foreign  option positions; Provided, however, that a futures commission merchant  may deposit an additional amount of up to 20 percent of the total amount  of funds necessary to meet margin and prefunding margin requirements to  avoid daily transfers of funds between the futures commission merchant's  30.7 accounts maintained in the United States and those maintained  outside of the United States. A futures commission merchant must deposit  30.7 customer funds under the laws and regulations of the foreign  jurisdiction that provide the greatest degree of protection to such  funds. A futures commission merchant may not by contract or otherwise  waive any of the protections afforded customer funds under the laws of  the foreign jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Written acknowledgment from depositories. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A futures  commission merchant must obtain a written acknowledgment from each  depository prior to or contemporaneously with the   opening of an account by the futures commission merchant with such  depository; Provided, however, that a written acknowledgment need not be  obtained from a derivatives clearing organization that has adopted and  submitted to the Commission rules that provide for the separate holding  of foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, in accordance with  all relevant provisions of the Act, this part and the regulations and  orders promulgated thereunder, of all funds held on behalf of 30.7  customers and all instruments purchased with funds set aside as the  foreign futures or foreign options secured amount as provided for under  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The written acknowledgment must be in the form as set out in  appendix E to this part; Provided, however, that if the futures  commission merchant invests funds set aside as the foreign futures or  foreign options secured amount in money market mutual funds as a  permitted investment under paragraph (h) of this section and in  accordance with the terms and conditions of Sec. 1.25(c) of this  chapter, the written acknowledgment with respect to such investment must  be in the form as set out in appendix F to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer  funds only with a depository that agrees to provide the director of the  Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, or any successor  division, or such director's designees, with direct, read-only  electronic access to transaction and account balance information for  30.7 customer accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The written acknowledgment must contain the futures commission  merchant's authorization to the depository to provide direct, read-only  electronic access to 30.7 customer account transaction and account  balance information to the director of the Division of Swap Dealer and  Intermediary Oversight, or any successor division, or such director's  designees, without further notice to or consent from the futures  commission merchant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds  only with a depository that agrees to provide the Commission and the  futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization  with a copy of the executed written acknowledgment no later than three  business days after the opening of the account or the execution of a new  written acknowledgment for an existing account, as applicable. The  Commission must receive the written acknowledgment from the depository  via electronic means, in a format and manner determined by the  Commission. The written acknowledgment must contain the futures  commission merchant's authorization to the depository to provide the  written acknowledgment to the Commission and to the futures commission  merchant's designated self-regulatory organization without further  notice to or consent from the futures commission merchant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds  only with a depository that agrees that accounts containing 30.7  customer funds may be examined at any reasonable time by the director of  the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or the director  of the Division of Clearing and Risk, or any successor divisions, or  such directors' designees, or an appropriate officer, agent or employee  of the futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory  organization. The written acknowledgment must contain the futures  commission merchant's authorization to the depository to permit any such  examination to take place without further notice to or consent from the  futures commission merchant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds  only with a depository that agrees to reply promptly and directly to any  request from the director of the Division of Swap Dealer and  Intermediary Oversight or the director of the Division of Clearing and  Risk, or any successor divisions, or such directors' designees, or an  appropriate officer, agent or employee of the futures commission  merchant's designated self-regulatory organization for confirmation of  account balances or provision of any other information regarding or  related to an account. The written acknowledgment must contain the  futures commission merchant's authorization to the depository to reply  promptly and directly as   required by this paragraph without further notice to or consent from the  futures commission merchant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A futures commission merchant shall promptly file a copy of the  written acknowledgment with the Commission in the format and manner  specified by the Commission no later than three business days after the  opening of the account or the execution of a new written acknowledgment  for an existing account, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A futures commission merchant shall obtain a new written  acknowledgment within 120 days of any changes in the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name or business address of the futures commission merchant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name or business address of the depository; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The account number(s) under which the foreign futures or  foreign options secured amount are held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A futures commission merchant shall maintain each written  acknowledgment readily accessible in its files in accordance with Sec.  1.31 of this chapter, for as long as the account remains open, and  thereafter for the period provided in Sec. 1.31 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Commingling. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A futures commission merchant may commingle the  funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount  that it receives from, or on behalf of, multiple 30.7 customers in a  single account or multiple accounts with one or more of the depositories  listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A futures commission merchant may not commingle the funds set  aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount held for  30.7 customers with the money, securities or property of such futures  commission merchant, with any proprietary account of such futures  commission merchant, or use such funds to secure or guarantee the  obligations of, or extend credit to, such futures commission merchant or  any proprietary account of such futures commission merchant; Provided,  however, a futures commission merchant may deposit proprietary funds  into 30.7 customer accounts as permitted under paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A futures commission merchant may not commingle 30.7 customer  funds with funds deposited by futures customers as defined in Sec. 1.3  of this chapter and held in segregated accounts pursuant to section  4d(a) and 4d(b) of the Act or with funds deposited by Cleared Swap  Customers as defined in Sec. 22.1 of this chapter and held in  segregated accounts pursuant to section 4d(f) of the Act, or with funds  of any account holders of the futures commission merchant unrelated to  trading foreign futures or foreign options;

A futures commission  merchant that has completed its daily 30.7 calculation may make  withdrawals, in addition to withdrawals that are made to or for the  benefit of 30.7 customers, to the extent of its actual residual  financial interest in funds held in 30.7 accounts, including the  withdrawal of securities held in secured amount safekeeping accounts  held by a bank, trust company, contract market, clearing organization,  member of a foreign board of trade, or other futures commission  merchant.

Notwithstanding the  foregoing, if the futures commission merchant's residual interest in  separate accounts for the benefit of 30.7 customers is less than the  amount required to be maintained by paragraph (f) of this section at any  particular point in time, the futures commission merchant must  immediately restore the residual interest to exceed the sum of such  amounts. Any proprietary funds deposited in the 30.7 customer accounts  must be unencumbered and otherwise compliant with Sec. 1.25 of this  chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a futures  commission merchant may not withdraw funds from 30.7 accounts, except  withdrawals   that are made for the benefit of 30.7 customers, unless the futures  commission merchant follows its policies and procedures required by  Sec. 1.11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Permitted investments and deposits of 30.7 customer funds. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A  futures commission merchant may invest 30.7 customer funds subject to,  and in compliance with, the terms and conditions of Sec. 1.25 of this  chapter.

The proceeds of such loans used to purchase, margin,  guarantee, or secure the trades, contracts, or commodity options of 30.7  customers shall be treated and dealt with by a futures commission  merchant as belonging to such 30.7 customers. A futures commission  merchant may not loan funds on an unsecured basis to finance a 30.7  customer's foreign futures and foreign options trading, nor may a  futures commission merchant loan funds to a 30.7 customer secured by the  30.7 customer's trading account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Permitted withdrawals.
