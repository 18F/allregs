The amount of such compensation shall be determined by an appraisal as of the date of

revocation or termination of the permit, license or lease, but shall not exceed fair market value. To the extent such improvements were constructed with Federal funds, they shall not be compensable unless the United States has been reimbursed for such funds prior to the allowance of the application and then only to the extent of the sum that the United States has received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an application is allowed that affects public lands which are subject to permits or leases for the grazing of domestic livestock and that is required to be terminated, the applicant shall comply with the cancellation notice and compensation requirements of section 402(g) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1752(g)), to the extent applicable.</p>
