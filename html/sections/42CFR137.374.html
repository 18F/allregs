The Self-Governance Tribe is responsible for acquiring all real property needed to perform a construction project under a construction project agreement, not the Secretary. The Secretary shall not withhold funds or refuse to enter into a construction project agreement because of a disagreement between the Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary over the Self-Governance Tribe's decisions to purchase or lease real property.</p>
