The  international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary  entrance of an accessible facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This section does not require the Foundation to take any action  that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the  nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative  burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that  the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or  would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the  Foundation has the initial burden of establishing that compliance with  Sec. 606.60 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision  that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made  by the Foundation Director or his or her designee after considering all  Foundation resources available for use in the funding and operation of  the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written  statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action  required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration  or such burdens, the Foundation shall take any other action that would  not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless  ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps  receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
