Each service line connection to a main must be located at the top of the main or, if that is not practical, at the side of the main, unless a suitable protective device is installed to minimize the possibility of dust and moisture being carried from the main into the service line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compression-type connection to main.
