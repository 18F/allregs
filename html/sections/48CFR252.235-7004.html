As used in this clause--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assurance of compliance means a written assurance that an  institution will comply with requirements of 32 CFR Part 219, as well as  the terms of the assurance, which the Human Research Protection Official  determines to be appropriate for the research supported by the  Department of Defense (DoD) component (32 CFR 219.103).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Human Research Protection Official (HRPO) means the individual  designated by the head of the applicable DoD component and identified in  the component's Human Research Protection Management Plan as the  official who is responsible for the oversight and execution of the  requirements of this clause, although some DoD components may use a  different title for this position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Human subject means a living individual about whom an  investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research  obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or  identifiable private information (32 CFR 219.102(f)). For example, this  could include the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from  individually identifiable living human subjects as well as graphic,  written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable  living human subjects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Institution means any public or private entity or agency (32 CFR  219.102(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Institutional Review Board (IRB) means a board established for  the purposes expressed in 32 CFR Part 219 (32 CFR 219.102(g)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the  research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within  the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and  Federal requirements (32 CFR 219.102(h)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Research means a systematic investigation, including research,  development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute  to generalizable knowledge. Activities that meet this definition  constitute research for purposes of 32 CFR Part 219, whether or not they  are conducted or supported under a program that is considered research  for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs  may include research activities (32 CFR 219.102(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall oversee the execution of the research to  ensure compliance with this clause. The Contractor shall comply fully  with 32 CFR Part 219 and DoD Directive 3216.02, applicable DoD component  policies, 10 U.S.C. 980, and, when applicable, Food and Drug  Administration policies and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> have been met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the  Contracting Officer, an assurance of compliance and IRB approval and  receives notification from the Contracting Officer that the HRPO has  approved the assurance as appropriate for the research under the  Statement of Work and also that the HRPO has reviewed the protocol and  accepted the IRB approval for compliance with the DoD component  policies. The Contractor may furnish evidence of an existing assurance  of compliance for acceptance by the HRPO, if an appropriate assurance  has been approved in connection with previous research. The Contractor  shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately of any suspensions or  terminations of the assurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the  Contracting Officer, a determination that the human research proposed  meets exemption criteria in 32 CFR 219.101(b) and receives written  notification from the Contracting Officer that the exemption is  determined acceptable. The determination shall include citation of the  exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement. In  the event of a disagreement regarding the Contractor's furnished  exemption determination, the HRPO retains final judgment on what  research activities or classes of research are covered or are exempt  under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently  review and inspect the Contractor's research and research procedures  involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit  research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply  with DoD procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of  this clause will result in the issuance of a stop-work order under  Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.242-15 to immediately suspend,  in whole or in part, work and further payment under this contract, or  will result in other issuance of suspension of work and further payment  for as long as determined necessary at the discretion of the Contracting  Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>, in all subcontracts that may include  research involving human subjects in accordance with 32 CFR Part 219,  DoD Directive 3216.02, and 10 U.S.C. 980, including research that meets  exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101(b).
