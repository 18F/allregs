                                Sec.  1051.605  What provisions apply to engines already certified
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. If you are an engine manufacturer, this  section allows you to introduce into commerce new recreational vehicles,  and engines for recreational vehicles, if the engines are already  certified to the requirements that apply to spark-ignition engines under  40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1048 for the appropriate model  year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider  the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to  also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1051 for its  model year, without a separate application for certification under the  requirements of this part 1051. See Sec.  1051.610 for similar  provisions that apply to vehicles that are already certified to the  vehicle-based standards for motor vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicle-manufacturer provisions. If you are not an engine  manufacturer, you may install an engine certified for the appropriate  model year under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 in a recreational vehicle as  long as you meet all the requirements and conditions specified in  paragraph (d) of this section. If you modify the non-recreational engine  in any of the ways described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for  installation in a recreational vehicle, we will consider you a  manufacturer of recreational vehicles. Such engine modifications prevent  you from using the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> applies to engine  manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers who use such an engine, and all  other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended  application. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these  new engines and vehicles; however, we consider the certificate issued  under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to also be a valid  certificate of conformity under this part 1051 for its model year. If we  make a determination that these engines do not conform to the  regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them  under this part 1051 or under 40 CFR part 85 or 1068.505.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific requirements. If you are an engine or vehicle  manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements  regarding your new engine or vehicle, the vehicle using the engine is  eligible for an exemption under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your engine must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity  issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must not make any changes to the certified engine that could  reasonably be expected to increase its exhaust emissions for any  pollutant, or its evaporative emissions. For example, if you make any of  the following changes to one of these engines, you do not qualify for  this exemption:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Change any fuel system or evaporative system parameters from the  certified configuration (this does not apply to refueling controls).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Change, remove, or fail to properly install any other  component, element of design, or calibration specified in the engine  manufacturer's application for certification. This includes  aftertreatment devices and all related components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Modify or design the engine cooling system so that  temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original engine  manufacturer's specified ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must show that fewer than 50 percent of the engine family's  total sales in the United States are used in recreational vehicles. This  includes engines used in any application, without regard to which  company manufactures the vehicle or equipment. Show this as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this  showing on your sales information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of  the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must ensure that the engine has the emission control  information label we require under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must add a permanent supplemental label to the engine in a  position where it will remain clearly visible after installation in the  vehicle. In the supplemental label, do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include the heading: ``RECREATIONAL VEHICLE EMISSION CONTROL  INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may instead  include the full corporate name and trademark of another company you  choose to designate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State: ``THIS ENGINE WAS ADAPTED FOR A RECREATIONAL USE  WITHOUT AFFECTING ITS EMISSION CONTROLS.''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State the date you finished installation (month and year), if  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The original and supplemental labels must be readily visible  after the engine is installed in the vehicle or, if the vehicle obscures  the engine's emission control information label, the make sure the  vehicle manufacturer attaches duplicate labels, as described in 40 CFR  1068.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter by the  end of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you) with all the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone  number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List the engine or vehicle models you expect to produce under  this exemption in the coming year and describe your basis for meeting  the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State: ``We produce each listed [engine or vehicle] model for  recreational application without making any changes that could increase  its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1051.605.''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to comply. If your engines do not meet the criteria  listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the  standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 1051 and the  certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 will not be deemed to  also be a certificate issued under this part 1051. Introducing these  engines into commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of  conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data submission. We may require you to send us emission test  data on any applicable nonroad duty cycles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Participation in averaging, banking and trading. Engines or  vehicles adapted for recreational use under this section may not  generate or use emission credits under this part 1051. These engines or  vehicles may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part  86. These engines or vehicles must use emission credits under 40 CFR  part 86 if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an applicable  standard.  [70 FR 40501, July 13, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 59254, Oct. 8, 2008]</p>
