                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary discovery. All parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending sanctions proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on discovery. The administrative law judge shall place such limits upon the kind or amount of discovery to be had or the period of time during which discovery may be carried out as shall be consistent with the time limitations set forth in this Part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of documents. A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and the party may then apply to the administrative law judge for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will serve a discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, if a hearing has been requested and scheduled, unless the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents and responses thereto will be served on all parties. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested will be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 days after the date of service of the request, or within such further time as the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the testimony of any person who is a party, or under the control or authority of a party, by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and shall set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party is under a duty to seasonably supplement the party's response with respect to any question directly addressed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at a hearing, the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify, and the substance of the testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party is under a duty to seasonably amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which the party:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Knows the response was incorrect when made; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Knows that the response, though correct when made, is no longer true, and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the administrative law judge, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to a hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Enforcement. The administrative law judge may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge may make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as the administrative law judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The administrative law judge may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part, or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purpose of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In issuing a discovery order, the administrative law judge will consider the necessity to protect proprietary information and will not order the release of information in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of such information.</p>
