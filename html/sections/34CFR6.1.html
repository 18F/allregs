                            <p class="depth0">It is the general policy of the Department that the results of  Department research should be made widely, promptly and freely available  to other research workers and to the public. This availability can  generally be adequately preserved by the dedication of a Government- owned invention to the public. Determinations to file a domestic patent  application on inventions in which the Department has an interest will  be made where the circumstances indicate that this is desirable in the  public interest, and if it is practicable to do so. Department  determinations not to apply for a domestic patent on employee inventions  are subject to review and approval by the Commissioner of Patents.  Except where deemed necessary for protecting the patent claim, the fact  that a patent application has been or may be filed will not require any  departure from normal policy regarding the dissemination of the results  of Department research.</p>
