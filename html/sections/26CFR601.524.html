                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time of filing. A copy of the power of attorney must be filed in each office (that is, office of a regional regulatory administrator and Office of the Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), in which a document specified in Sec.  601.522, covered by the power of attorney, is required to be filed, or in which the representative desires to perform one or more of the acts enumerated in paragraph (c)(1) of Sec.  601.502. If a power of attorney covering an act otherwise requiring the filing of a tax information authorization has not been filed, a copy of the tax information authorization must be filed in each office in which the representative inspects or receives confidential information, or, where acts requiring a power of attorney or a tax information authorization are handled by correspondence, the representative should enclose a copy of the power or authorization with the initial correspondence. However, where a power of attorney or tax information authorization is on file with the regional regulatory administrator in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, an additional copy thereof will not be required in the office of the regional counsel of the same region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Execution. The power of attorney required by Sec.  601.522, or tax information authorization required by Sec.  601.523, shall be executed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of Sec.  601.504; shall indicate all acts to which it relates; should contain the mailing address of the representative; and, if more than one representative is authorized to perform the same acts on behalf of the industry member or other person, a designation as to which representative is to receive notices and other written communications. For rules relating to the mailing of notices or other written communications to a representative, see Sec.  601.506.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attestation and corporate seal. In the case of a corporation, a power of attorney filed with an officer of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms must be attested by the secretary and the corporate seal must be affixed. If the officer who signs the power of attorney is also the secretary, another officer of the corporation, preferably the president, vice president, or treasurer, must also sign the power of attorney so that two different individuals' signatures appear thereon. If the corporation has no seal, a certified copy of a resolution duly passed on by the board of directors of the corporation authorizing the execution of powers of attorney should be attached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acknowledgment. A power of attorney filed with an office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms must be acknowledged, witnessed, or certified as provided in paragraph (d) of Sec.  601.504.
