A Letter of Conditions will be prepared by  the Agency, establishing conditions that must be agreed to by the  Applicant before any obligation of funds can occur. Upon reviewing the  conditions and requirements in the Letter of Conditions, the Applicant  must complete, sign, and return the Form RD 1942-46, ``Letter of Intent  to Meet Conditions,'' and Form RD 1940-1, ``Request for Obligation of  Funds,'' to the Agency if they accept the conditions of the grant; or if  certain conditions cannot be met, the Applicant may propose alternate  conditions to the Agency. The Agency must concur with any changes  proposed to the Letter of Conditions by the Applicant before the  application will be further processed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Insurance requirements. Agency approved insurance coverage must  be maintained for 3 years after the Agency has approved the final  performance report unless this requirement is waived or modified by the  Agency in writing. Insurance coverage shall include, but is not limited  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Property insurance, such as fire and extended coverage, will  normally be maintained on all structures and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> National flood insurance is required in accordance with 7 CFR  part 1806, subpart B, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Business interruption insurance for projects with Total Project  Costs of more than $200,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(8)</em> of this section, which is to be completed  by contractors, does not need to be returned to the Agency, but must be  kept on file by the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form RD 1942-46, ``Letter of Intent to Meet Conditions.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form RD 1940-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Form AD-1049, ``Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace  Requirements (Grants) Alternative 1-For Grantees Other than  Individuals.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Form SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities,'' if the grant  exceeds $100,000 and/or if the grantee has made or agreed to make  payment using funds other than Federal appropriated funds to influence  or attempt to influence a decision in connection with the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Form AD-1047, ``Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension,  and Other Responsibility Matters-Primary Covered Transactions.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Form RD 400-1, ``Equal Opportunity Agreement,'' or successor  form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Form RD 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement,'' or successor form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Form AD-1048, as signed by the contractor or other lower tier  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence of Matching Funds and other funds. If an Applicant  submitted written evidence of Matching Funds and other funds with the  application, the Applicant is responsible for ensuring that such written  evidence is still in effect (i.e., not expired) when the grant is  executed. If the Applicant did not submit written evidence of Matching  Funds and other funds with the application, the Applicant must submit  such written evidence that is in effect before the Agency will execute  the Grant Agreement. In either case, written evidence of Matching Funds  and other funds needed to complete the project must be provided to the  Agency before execution of the Grant Agreement and must be in effect  (i.e., must not have expired) at the time Grant Agreement is executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> SAM number. Before the Grant Agreement can be executed, the  number and expiration date of the Applicant's SAM number are required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grant Agreement. Once the requirements specified in paragraphs  (a) through (e) of this section have been met, the Grant Agreement can  be executed by the grantee and the Agency. The grantee must abide by all  requirements contained in the Grant Agreement, this subpart, and any  other applicable Federal statutes or regulations. Failure to follow  these requirements might result in termination of the grant and adoption  of other available remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grant approval.
