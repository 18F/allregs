                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On a statewide basis, staff representative of the racial and  ethnic characteristics in the work force shall be distributed in  substantially the same proportion among (1) all ``job groups'' (as that  term is defined by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance   Programs), and (2) all offices in the plan(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As part of the PBP, each State agency shall develop and  submit to the Regional Administrator affirmative action plans for all  significant local offices within its jurisdiction (which, for the  purposes of this provision, means those local offices representing the  top 20 per cent of MSFW activity nationally). These affirmative action  plans shall include goals and timetables and shall ensure that  sufficient numbers of qualified, permanent minority staff are hired.  Where qualified minority applicants are not available to be hired as  permanent staff, qualified minority part-time, provisional, or temporary  staff shall be hired in accordance with State merit system procedures,  where applicable. These affirmative action plans shall be prepared on an  individual office basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The affirmative action plans shall include an analysis of the  racial and ethnic characteristics of the work force in the local office  service area. To determine the ``work force'' for the purpose of this  paragraph, the State agency shall include the racial and ethnic  characteristics of any MSFW population which is not a part of the  permanent work force by computing an estimate of the total work years  MSFWs collectively spend in the area and including a number of workers  equivalent to this estimate as part of the permanent work force. This  computation shall be made by calculating the average length of time, as  a fractional part of a year, MSFWs stay in the area and then multiplying  this figure by the total estimated MSFW population in the area during  the previous year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The affirmative action plan also shall include an analysis of  the local office staffing characteristics. The plan shall provide a  comparison between the characteristics of the staff and the work force  and determine if the composition of the local office staff(s) is  representative of the racial and ethnic characteristics of the work  force in the local office service area(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the staff under-represents any of these characteristics, the  State agency shall establish a staffing goal at a level equivalent to  the percentage of the characteristics in the work force in the local  office service areas. The State agency also shall establish a reasonable  timetable for achieving the staffing goal by hiring or promoting  available, qualified staff in the under-represented categories. In  establishing timetables, the State agency shall consider the vacancies  anticipated through expansion, contraction, and turnover in the  office(s) and available funds, and all affirmative action plans shall  establish timetables that are designed to achieve the staffing goal no  later than December 31, 1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition, each State agency which has significant local  offices, shall undertake special efforts to recruit MSFWs and persons  from MSFW back-grounds for its staff, shall document achievements, and  shall include in the affirmative action plan(s) a complete description  of specific actions which the agency will take and time frames within  which these actions will be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As part of the annual Program and Budget Plan (PBP) process, the  funding of State agencies which are required to develop and implement  affirmative action plans for significant local offices shall be  contingent upon the timely submittal of adequate affirmative action  plans and the substantial and timely attainment of the goals and  timetables contained in those plans. However, if the Regional  Administrator makes a finding of good faith efforts, he/she may fund a  State agency   even though it did not achieve substantial and timely compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) required to develop  affirmative action plans for significant local offices shall keep  accurate records of their employment practices for those offices,  including information on all applications. These records shall be  maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements concerning  affirmative action which are established by ETA and distributed to the  SWAs. All records shall be made available to the State MSFW Monitor  Advocate, EEO staff and Federal On-Site Review Teams.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Affirmative action plans shall contain a description of specific  steps to be taken for the adequate recruitment of MSFWs for all vacant  positions in significant local offices and the central office. These  steps shall include advertisements in newspapers, radio or other media,  in a manner calculated to best reach the MSFW population, and contacts  by outreach workers and the State MSFW Monitor Advocate with groups  serving the MSFW population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> State EEO staff shall have the responsibility for developing  affirmative action plans. The State MSFW Monitor Advocate(s) shall  comment on the plan to the State Administrator. Upon submission of the  affirmative action plan as part of the State agency's PBP submittal, the  Regional MSFW Monitor Advocate shall review the affirmative action  plan(s) as it pertains to MSFWs and comment to the Regional  Administrator. As part of his/her regular reviews of State agency  compliance, the Regional MSFW Monitor Advocate shall monitor the extent  to which the State has complied with its affirmative action plan(s) as  it pertains to MSFWs. The Regional MSFW Monitor Advocate's finding as to  the adequacy of the plan(s) and as to the State's compliance with the  plan(s) shall be considered in PBP decisions involving future funding of  the State agency.
