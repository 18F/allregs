                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A civil money penalty may be assessed by the Administrator, WHD  for each violation that meets the standards described in Sec. 503.19.  Each such violation involving the failure to pay an individual worker  properly or to honor the terms or conditions of a worker's employment  required by the H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage  Determination, Application for Temporary Employment Certification, or H- 2B Petition, constitutes a separate violation. Civil money penalty  amounts for such violations are determined as set forth in paragraphs  (b) to (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon determining that an employer has violated any provisions of  Sec. 503.16 related to wages, impermissible deductions or prohibited  fees and expenses, the Administrator, WHD may assess civil money  penalties that are equal to the difference between the amount that  should have been paid and the amount that actually was paid to such  worker(s), not to exceed $10,000 per violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon determining that an employer has terminated by layoff or  otherwise or has refused to employ any worker in violation of Sec.  503.16(r), (t), or   (v), within the periods described in those sections, the Administrator,  WHD may assess civil money penalties that are equal to the wages that  would have been earned but for the layoff or failure to hire, not to  exceed $10,000 per violation. No civil money penalty will be assessed,  however, if the employee refused the job opportunity, or was terminated  for lawful, job-related reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator, WHD may assess civil money penalties in an  amount not to exceed $10,000 per violation for any other violation that  meets the standards described in Sec. 503.19.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In determining the amount of the civil money penalty to be  assessed under paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator, WHD  will consider the type of violation committed and other relevant  factors. In determining the level of penalties to be assessed, the  highest penalties will be reserved for willful failures to meet any of  the conditions of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification  and H-2B Petition that involve harm to U.S. workers. Other factors which  may be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Previous history of violation(s) of 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20 CFR  part 655, subpart A, or the regulations in this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of H-2B workers, workers in corresponding employment,  or improperly rejected U.S. applicants who were and/or are affected by  the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The gravity of the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Efforts made in good faith to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20  CFR part 655, subpart A, and the regulations in this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Explanation from the person charged with the violation(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Commitment to future compliance, taking into account the public  health, interest or safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due  to the violation, or the potential financial loss or potential injury to  the workers.</p>
