                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A child is classified as having a learning disability who has a  disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in  understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which may  manifest itself in imperfect ability to listen, think, speak or, for  preschool age children, acquire the precursor skills for reading,  writing, spelling or doing mathematical calculations. The term includes  such conditions as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, and aphasia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An evaluation team may recommend that a child be classified as  having a learning disability if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and  ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in (a) above when  provided with appropriate learning experiences for the age and ability;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The child has a severe discrepancy between achievement of  developmental milestones and intellectual ability in one or more of  these areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, pre-reading, pre- writing and pre-mathematics; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The child shows deficits in such abilities as memory, perceptual  and perceptual-motor skills, thinking, language and non-verbal  activities which are not due to visual, motor, hearing or emotional  disabilities, mental retardation, cultural or language factors, or lack  of experiences which would help develop these skills.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This definition for learning disabilities applies to four and  five year old children in Head Start. It may be used at a program's  discretion for children younger than four or when a three year old child  is referred with a professional diagnosis of learning disability. But  because of the difficulty of diagnosing learning disabilities for three  year olds, when Head Start is responsible for the evaluation it is not a  requirement to use this category for three year olds.</p>
