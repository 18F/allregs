                            <p class="depth0">The customer satisfaction goals and accomplishments of operating  units within the IRS will be determined on the basis of information  gathered through various methods. For example, questionnaires, surveys  and other types of information gathering mechanisms may be employed to  gather data regarding customer satisfaction. Information to measure  customer satisfaction for a particular work unit will be gathered from a  statistically valid sample of the customers served by that operating  unit and will be used to measure, among other things, whether those  customers believe that they received courteous, timely, and professional  treatment by the IRS personnel with whom they dealt. Customers will be  permitted to provide information requested for these purposes under  conditions that guarantee them anonymity. For purposes of this section,  customers may include individual taxpayers, organizational units, or  employees within the IRS and external groups affected by the services  performed by the IRS operating unit.
