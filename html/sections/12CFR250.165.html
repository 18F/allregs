                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 207 of the Bank Export Services Act (Title II of Pub.  L. 97-290) (``BESA'') raised the limits on the aggregate amount of  eligible bankers' acceptances (``BAs'') that may be created by a member  bank from 50 percent (or 100 percent with the permission of the Board)  of its paid up and unimpaired capital stock and surplus (``capital'') to  150 percent (or 200 percent with the permission of the Board) of its  capital. Section 207 also prohibits a member bank from creating eligible  BAs for any one person in the aggregate in excess of 10 percent of the  institution's capital. Eligible BAs growing out of domestic transactions  are not to exceed 50 percent of the aggregate of all eligible  acceptances authorized for a member bank. This section of the BESA  applies the same limits applicable to member banks to U.S. branches and  agencies of foreign banks that are subject to reserve requirements under  section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3105). \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ The institutions subject to the BA limitations of BESA will  hereinafter be referred to as ``covered banks.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section of the BESA also provides that any portion of an  eligible BA created by a covered bank (``senior bank'') that is conveyed  through a ``participation agreement'' to another covered bank (``junior  bank'') shall not be included in the calculation of the senior bank's  bankers' acceptance limits established by section 207 of BESA. \2\  However, the amount of the participation is to be included in the BA  limits applicable to the junior bank. The language of the statute does  not define what constitutes a participation agreement for purposes of  the applicability of the BESA limitations. However, the statute does  authorize the Board to further define any of the terms used in section  207 of the BESA (12 U.S.C. 372(g)). The Board is clarifying the term  participation for purposes of the BA limitations of the BESA. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ The use of the terms senior bank and junior bank has no  implications regarding priority of claims. These terms merely represent  a shorthand method of identifying the depository institution that has  created the acceptance and conveyed the participation (senior bank) and  the depository institution that has received the participation (junior  bank). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The legislative history of section 207 of the BESA indicates  that Congress intended that the junior bank be obligated to the senior  bank in the   event that the account party defaults on its obligation to pay, but that  the junior bank need not also be obligated to pay the holder of the  acceptance at the time the BA is presented for payment. H. Rep. No. 97- 629, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 15 (1982); 128 Cong. Rec. H 4647 (daily ed.  July 27, 1982) (remarks by Rep. Barnard): and 128 Cong. Rec. H 8462  (daily ed. October 1, 1982) (remarks by Rep. Barnard). The legislative  history also indicates that Congress intended that eligible BAs in which  participations had been conveyed not be required to indicate the name(s)  (or interest(s)) of the junior bank(s) on the acceptance in order for  the BA to be excluded from the BESA limitations applicable to the senior  bank. 128 Cong. Rec. S 12237 (daily ed. September 24, 1982) (remarks of  Senators Heinz and Garn): and 128 Cong. Rec. H 4647 (daily ed. July 27,  1982) (remarks of Rep. Barnard).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In view of Congressional intent with regard to what  constitutes a participation in an eligible BA, the Board has determined  that, for purposes of the BESA limits, a participation must satisfy the  following two minimum requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A written agreement entered into between the junior and senior  bank under which the junior bank acquires the senior bank's claim  against the account party to the extent of the amount of the  participation that is enforceable in the event that the account party  fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the acceptance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agreement between the junior and senior bank provides that  the senior bank obtains a claim against the junior bank to the extent of  the amount of the participation that is enforceable in the event the  account party fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the  acceptance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consistent with Congressional intent, the minimum requirements  do not require the junior bank to be obligated to pay the holder of the  acceptance at the time the BA is presented for payment. Similarly, the  minimum requirements do not require the name(s) or interest(s) of the  junior bank(s) to appear on the face of the acceptance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An eligible BA that is conveyed through a participation that  does not satisfy these minimum requirements would continue to be  included in the BA limits applicable to the senior bank. Further, an  eligible BA conveyed to a covered bank through a participation that  provided for additional rights and obligations among the parties would  be excluded from the BESA limitations of the senior bank provided the  minimum requirements were satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A participation structured pursuant to these minimum  requirements would be as follows: Upon the conveyance of the  participation, the senior bank retains its entire obligation to pay the  holder of the BA at maturity. The senior bank has a claim against the  junior bank to the extent of the amount of the participation that is  enforceable in the event the account party fails to perform in  accordance with the terms of the acceptance. Similarly, the junior bank  has a corresponding claim against the account party to the extent of the  amount of the participation that is enforceable in the event the account  party fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the acceptance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board is not requiring the senior bank and the account  party specifically to agree that the senior bank's rights are assignable  because the Board believes such rights to be assignable even in the  absence of an explicit agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The junior and senior banks may contract among themselves as to  which party(ies) have the responsibility for administering the  arrangement, enforcing claims, or exercising remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Board recognizes that both the junior bank's claim on the  account party and the senior bank's claim on the junior bank involve  risk. Therefore, it is essential that these risks be assessed by the  banks involved in accordance with prudent and sound banking practices.  The examiners will in the normal course of the examination process  review the risk assessment procedures instituted by the banks. The  junior bank should review the creditworthiness of each account party  when the junior bank acquires a participation and the senior bank should  review   on an ongoing basis the creditworthiness of the junior bank. Junior bank  agreement to rely exclusively upon the credit judgment of the senior  bank and purchase on an ongoing basis from the senior bank all  participations in BAs regardless of the identity of the account party is  not appropriate in view of the risks involved. However, in those cases  involving a participation between a parent bank and its Edge affiliate  where the credit review for both entities is performed by the parent  bank, the Edge Corporation should maintain documentation indicating that  it concurs with the parent bank's analysis and that the acceptance  participation is appropriate for inclusion in the Edge Corporation's  portfolio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Similarly, the Board has determined that it is appropriate to  include the risks incurred by the senior bank in assessing the senior  bank's capital and the risks incurred by the junior bank in assessing  the junior bank's capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In view of this clarification of the issues relating to  participations in BAs, the Board encourages the private sector to  develop standardized forms for BAs and participations therein that  clearly delineate the rights and responsibilities of the relevant  parties.  (Sec. 13, Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 372))  [48 FR 57109, Dec. 28, 1983]</p>
