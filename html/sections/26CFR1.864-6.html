                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Income, gain, or loss from sources without the  United States   which is specified in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.864-5 and received by a  nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation engaged in a trade  or business in the United States at some time during a taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1966, shall be treated as effectively  connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States only if the income, gain, or loss is attributable  under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to an office or other fixed  place of business, as defined in Sec. 1.864-7, which the taxpayer has  in the United States at some time during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Material factor test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph  (a) of this section, income, gain, or loss is attributable to an office  or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or  a foreign corporation has in the United States only if such office or  other fixed place of business is a material factor in the realization of  the income, gain, or loss, and if the income, gain, or loss is realized  in the ordinary course of the trade or business carried on through that  office or other fixed place of business. For this purpose, the  activities of the office or other fixed place of business shall not be  considered to be a material factor in the realization of the income,  gain, or loss unless they provide a significant contribution to, by  being an essential economic element in, the realization of the income,  gain, or loss. Thus, for example, meetings in the United States of the  board of directors of a foreign corporation do not of themselves  constitute a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or  loss. It is not necessary that the activities of the office or other  fixed place of business in the United States be a major factor in the  realization of the income, gain, or loss. An office or other fixed place  of business located in the United States at some time during a taxable  year may be a material factor in the realization of an item of income,  gain, or loss for that year even though the office or other fixed place  of business is not present in the United States when the income, gain,  or loss is realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of material factor test to specific classes of  income. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an office or  other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a  foreign corporation, engaged in a trade or business in the United States  at some time during the taxable year, had in the United States, shall be  considered a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss  consisting of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rents, royalties, or gains on sales of intangible property.  Rents, royalties, or gains or losses, from intangible personal property  specified in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.864-5, if the office or other  fixed place of business either actively participates in soliciting,  negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange, the  lease, license, sale, or exchange from which such income, gain, or loss  is derived or performs significant services incident to such lease,  license, sale, or exchange. An office or other fixed place of business  in the United States shall not be considered to be a material factor in  the realization of income, gain, or loss for purposes of this  subdivision merely because the office or other fixed place of business  conducts one or more of the following activities: (a) Develops, creates,  produces, or acquires and adds substantial value to, the property which  is leased, licensed, or sold, or exchanged, (b) collects or accounts for  the rents, royalties, gains, or losses, (c) exercises general  supervision over the activities of the persons directly responsible for  carrying on the activities or services described in the immediately  preceding sentence, (d) performs merely clerical functions incident to  the lease, license, sale, or exchange or (e) exercises final approval  over the execution of the lease, license, sale, or exchange. The  application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. F, a foreign corporation, is engaged in the active  conduct of the business of licensing patents which it has either  purchased or developed in the United States. F has a business office in  the United States. Licenses for the use of such patents outside the  United States are negotiated by offices of F located outside the United  States, subject to approval by an officer of such corporation located in  the U.S. office. All services which are rendered to F's foreign  licensees are performed by employees of F's offices located outside the  United States. None of   the income, gain, or loss resulting from the foreign licenses so  negotiated by F is attributable to its business office in the United  States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. N, a foreign corporation, is engaged in the active  conduct of the business of distributing motion picture films and  television programs. N does not distribute such films or programs in the  United States. The foreign distribution rights to these films and  programs are acquired by N's U.S. business office from the U.S. owners  of these films and programs. Employees of N's offices located in various  foreign countries carry on in such countries all the solicitations and  negotiations for the licensing of these films and programs to licensees  located in such countries and provide the necessary incidental services  to the licensees. N's U.S. office collects the rentals from the foreign  licensees and maintains the necessary records of income and expense.  Officers of N located in the United States also maintain general  supervision over the employees of the foreign offices, but the foreign  employees conduct the day to day business of N outside the United States  of soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to  arrange the foreign licenses. None of the income, gain, or loss  resulting from the foreign licenses so negotiated by N is attributable  to N's U.S. office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dividends or interest, or gains or losses from sales of stock  or securities--(a) In general. Dividends or interest from any  transaction, or gains or losses on the sale or exchange of stocks or  securities, specified in paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.864-5, if the  office or other fixed place of business either actively participates in  soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to  arrange, the issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange, of the asset from  which such income, gain, or loss is derived or performs significant  services incident to such issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange. An  office or other fixed place of business in the United States shall not  be considered to be a material factor in the realization of income,  gain, or loss for purposes of this subdivision merely because the office  or other fixed place of business conducts one or more of the following  activities: (1) Collects or accounts for the dividends, interest, gains,  or losses, (2) exercises general supervision over the activities of the  persons directly responsible for carrying on the activities or services  described in the immediately preceding sentence, (3) performs merely  clerical functions incident to the issue, acquisition, sale, or  exchange, or (4) exercises final approval over the execution of the  issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective connection of income from stocks or securities with  active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business.  Notwithstanding (a) of this subdivision (ii), the determination as to  whether any dividends or interest from stocks or securities, or gain or  loss from the sale or exchange of stocks or securities which are capital  assets, which is from sources without the United States and derived by a  nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation in the active  conduct during the taxable year of a banking, financing, or similar  business in the United States, shall be treated as effectively connected  for such year with the active conduct of that business shall be made by  applying the principles of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of Sec. 1.864-4 for  determining whether income, gain, or loss of such type from sources  within the United States is effectively connected for such year with the  active conduct of that business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Security defined. For purposes of this subdivision (ii), a  security is any bill, note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of  indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in, or right to subscribe  or to purchase, any of the foregoing items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitations on application of rules on banking, financing, or  similar business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Trading for taxpayer's own account. The provisions  of (b) of this subdivision (ii) apply for purposes of determining when  certain income, gain, or loss from stocks or securities is effectively  connected with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar  business in the United States. Any dividends, interest, gain, or loss  from sources without the United States which by reason of the  application of (b) of this subdivision (ii) is not effectively connected  with the active conduct by a foreign corporation of a banking,  financing, or similar business in the United States may be effectively  connected for the taxable year, under (a) of this subdivision (ii), with  the conduct by such taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States  which consists of trading in stocks or securities for the taxpayer's own  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other income. For rules relating to dividends or interest from  sources without the United States (other than dividends or interest  from, or gain or loss from the sale or exchange of, stocks or securities  referred to in (b) of this subdivision (ii)) derived in the active  conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United  States, see (a) of this subdivision (ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sale of goods or merchandise through U.S. office. Income,  gain, or loss from sales of goods or merchandise specified in paragraph  (b)(3) of Sec. 1.864-5, if the office or other fixed place of business  actively participates in soliciting the order, negotiating the contract  of sale, or performing other significant services necessary for the  consummation of the sale which are not the subject of a separate  agreement between the seller and the buyer. The office or other fixed  place of business in the United States shall be considered a material  factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss from a sale made as a  result of a sales order received in such office or other fixed place of  business except where the sales order is received unsolicited and that  office or other fixed place of business is not held out to potential  customers as the place to which such sales orders should be sent. The  income, gain, or loss must be realized in the ordinary course of the  trade or business carried on through the office or other fixed place of  business in the United States. Thus, if a foreign corporation is engaged  solely in a manufacturing business in the United States, the income  derived by its office in the United States as a result of an occasional  sale outside the United States is not attributable to the U.S. office if  the sales office of the manufacturing business is located outside the  United States. On the other hand, if a foreign corporation establishes a  sales office in the United States to sell for consumption in the Western  Hemisphere merchandise which the corporation produces in Africa, the  income derived by the sales office in the United States as a result of  an occasional sale made by it in Europe shall be attributable to the  U.S. sales office. An office or other fixed place of business in the  United States shall not be considered to be a material factor in the  realization of income, gain, or loss for purposes of this subdivision  merely because of one or more of the following activities: (a) The sale  is made subject to the final approval of such office or other fixed  place of business, (b) the property sold is held in, and distributed  from, such office or other fixed place of business, (c) samples of the  property sold are displayed (but not otherwise promoted or sold) in such  office or other fixed place of business, or (d) such office or other  fixed place of business performs merely clerical functions incident to  the sale. Activities carried on by employees of an office or other fixed  place of business constitute activities of that office or other fixed  place of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation where foreign office is a material factor in  realization of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Goods or merchandise destined for foreign  use, consumption, or disposition. Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and  (2) of this paragraph, an office or other fixed place of business which  a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the  United States shall not be considered, for purposes of paragraph (a) of  this section, to be a material factor in the realization of income,  gain, or loss from sales of goods or merchandise specified in paragraph  (b)(3) of Sec. 1.864-5 if the property is sold for use, consumption, or  disposition outside the United States and an office or other fixed place  of business, as defined in Sec. 1.864-7, which such nonresident alien  individual or foreign corporation has outside the United States  participates materially in the sale. For this purpose an office or other  fixed place of business which the taxpayer has outside the United States  shall be considered to have participated materially in a sale made  through the office or other fixed place of business in the United States  if the office or other fixed place of business outside the United States  actively participates in soliciting the order resulting in the sale,  negotiating the contract of sale, or performing other significant  services necessary for the consummation of the sale which are not the  subject of a separate agreement between the seller and buyer. An office  or other fixed place of business which the taxpayer has outside the  United States shall not   be considered to have participated materially in a sale merely because  of one or more of the following activities: (a) The sale is made subject  to the final approval of such office or other fixed place of business,  (b) the property sold is held in, and distributed from, such office or  other fixed place of business, (c) samples of the property sold are  displayed (but not otherwise promoted or sold) in such office or other  fixed place of business, (d) such office or other fixed place of  business is used for purposes of having title to the property pass  outside the United States, or (e) such office or other fixed place of  business performs merely clerical functions incident to the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for determining country of use, consumption, or  disposition--(a) In general. As a general rule, personal property which  is sold to an unrelated person shall be presumed for purposes of this  subparagraph to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in  the country of destination of the property sold; for such purpose, the  occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in shipment of  property shall not cause that country to be considered the country of  destination. However, if at the time of a sale of personal property to  an unrelated person the taxpayer knew, or should have known from the  facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property  probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of  destination, the taxpayer must determine the country of ultimate use,  consumption, or disposition of the property or the property shall be  presumed to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the  United States. A taxpayer who sells personal property to a related  person shall be presumed to have sold the property for use, consumption,  or disposition in the United States unless the taxpayer establishes the  use made of the property by the related person; once he has established  that the related person has disposed of the property, the rules in the  two immediately preceding sentences relating to sales to an unrelated  person shall apply at the first stage in the chain of distribution at  which a sale is made by a related person to an unrelated person.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subdivision (a), a  taxpayer who sells personal property to any person whose principal  business consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at  retail outlets outside the United States may assume at the time of the  sale to that person that the property will be used, consumed, or  disposed of outside the United States. For purposes of this (a), a  person is related to another person if either person owns or controls  directly or indirectly the other, or if any third person or persons own  or control directly or indirectly both. For this purpose, the term  ``control'' includes any kind of control, whether or not legally  enforceable, and however, exercised or exercisable. For illustrations of  the principles of this subdivision, see paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of Sec.  1.954-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> shall apply  only in a case where the taxpayer knew, or should have known from the  facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, the manner in which  the first purchaser disposes of property from the fungible mass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustration. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation M has a sales office in the United  States during the taxable year through which it sells outside the United  States for use in foreign countries industrial electrical generators  which such corporation manufactures in a foreign country. M is not a  controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 and the  regulations thereunder, and, by reason of its   activities in the United States, is engaged in business in the United  States during the taxable year. The generators require specialized  installation and continuous adjustment and maintenance services. M has  an office in foreign country X which is the only organization qualified  to perform these installation, adjustment, and maintenance services.  During the taxable year M sells several generators through its U.S.  office for use in foreign country Y under sales contracts which also  provide for installation, adjustment, and maintenance by its office in  country X. The generators are installed in country Y by employees of M's  office in country X, who also are responsible for the servicing of the  equipment. Since the office of M in country X performs significant  services incident to these sales which are necessary for their  consummation and are not the subject of a separate agreement between M  and the purchaser, the U.S. office of M is not considered to be a  material factor in the realization of the income from the sales and, for  purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, such income is not  attributable to the U.S. office of that corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount of income, gain, or loss allocable to U.S. office--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. If, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an office  or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or  a foreign corporation has in the United States at some time during the  taxable year is a material factor in the realization for that year of an  item of income, gain, or loss specified in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.864- 5, such item of income, gain, or loss shall be considered to be  allocable in its entirety to that office or other fixed place of  business. In no case may any income, gain, or loss for the taxable year  from sources without the United States, or part thereof, be allocable  under this paragraph to an office or other fixed place of business which  a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the  United States if the taxpayer is at no time during the taxable year  engaged in a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.863-3, which  prescribes, as available methods for determining the income from sources  within the United States, the independent factory or production price  method, the gross sales and property apportionment method, and any other  method regularly employed by the taxpayer which more clearly reflects  taxable income from such sources than those specifically authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation M, which is not a controlled foreign  corporation within the meaning of section 957 and the regulations  thereunder, manufactures machinery in a foreign country and sells the  machinery outside the United States through its sales office in the  United States for use in foreign countries. Title to the property which  is sold is transferred to the foreign purchaser outside the United  States, but no office or other fixed place of business of M in a foreign  country participates materially in the sale made through its U.S.  office. During the taxable year M derives a total taxable income  (determined as though M were a domestic corporation) of $250,000 from  these sales. If the sales made through the U.S. office for the taxable  year had been made in the United States and the property had been sold  for use in the United States, the taxable income from sources within the  United States from such sales would have been $100,000, determined as  provided in section 863 and 882(c) and the regulations thereunder. The  taxable income which is allocable to M's U.S. sales office pursuant to  this paragraph and which is effectively connected for the taxable year  with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by that  corporation is $100,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation N, which is not a controlled foreign  corporation within the meaning of section 957 and the regulations  thereunder, has an office in a foreign country which purchases  merchandise and sells it through its sales office in the United States  for use in various foreign countries, such sales being made outside the  United States and title to the property passing outside the United  States. No other office of N   participates materially in these sales made through its U.S. office. By  reason of its sales activities in the United States, N is engaged in  business in the United States during the taxable year. During the  taxable year N derives taxable income (determined as though N were a  domestic corporation) of $300,000 from these sales made through its U.S.  sales office. If the sales made through the U.S. office for the taxable  year had been made in the United States and the property had been sold  for use in the United States, the taxable income from sources within the  United States from such sales would also have been $300,000, determined  as provided in sections 861 and 882(c) and the regulations thereunder.  The taxable income which is allocable to N's U.S. sales office pursuant  to this paragraph and which is effectively connected for the taxable  year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by  that corporation is $300,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, except that N has  an office in a foreign country which participates materially in the  sales which are made through its U.S. office. The taxable income which  is allocable to N's U.S. sales office is not effectively connected for  the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States by that corporation.
