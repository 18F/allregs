However, if the vessel undergoes a  change after July 18, 1994, that the Commandant finds substantially  affects the vessel's gross tonnage, the vessel must be remeasured only  under this system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A tonnage assignment under this system does not affect the  applicability to the vessel of international agreements to which the  United States Government is a party that are not in conflict with the  Convention or with the application of International Maritime  Organization (IMO) Resolutions A.494(XII) of November 19, 1981,  A.540(XIII) of November 17, 1983, and A.541(XIII) of November 17, 1983.  When applicable to the vessel, these Resolutions provide interim schemes  for using the vessel's existing gross tonnage, instead of the gross  tonnage under the Convention Measurement System, for applying the  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the  International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and  Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, (STCW), and the International  Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, (MARPOL),  respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard Measurement System (subpart C). This system applies to  a vessel not required to be measured under the   Convention Measurement System if the vessel is to be documented or if  the application of a law of the United States to the vessel depends on  the vessel's tonnage. Upon request of the owner, this system also  applies to a documented vessel measured under the Convention Measurement  System when Standard Measurement System tonnages are to be used in  applying the provisions of a law under 46 U.S.C. 14305.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dual Measurement System (subpart D). This system may be applied,  at the owner's option, instead of the Standard Measurement System, to a  vessel eligible or required to be measured under the Standard  Measurement System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Simplified Measurement System (subpart E). This system may be  applied, at the owner's option, instead of the Standard Measurement  System to the following vessels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A vessel that is under 79 feet in overall length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vessel of any length that is non-self-propelled and not  engaged on a foreign voyage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A vessel of any length that is operated only for pleasure and  operated only on the Great Lakes.
