For vessels for which annual inspections are required under Sec. 61.272(a)(2), the first report is to be submitted no more than 12 months after the initial report submitted in accordance with Sec. 61.274, and each report is to be submitted within 60 days of each annual inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each report shall include the date of the inspection of each storage vessel and identify each storage vessel in which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is detached from the internal floating roof, or there are holes, tears or other openings in the seal or seal fabric; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There are visible gaps between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where an annual report identifies any condition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section the annual report shall describe the nature of the defect, the date the storage vessel was emptied, and the nature of and date the repair was made, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an extension is requested in an annual periodic report in accordance with Sec. 61.272(a)(2), a supplemental periodic report shall be submitted within 15 days of repair.
