                            <p class="depth0">Yes. The expenses incurred for laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing at a TDY location are reimbursable as a miscellaneous travel expense. However, you must incur a minimum of 4 consecutive nights lodging on official travel to qualify for this reimbursement. Laundry and dry cleaning expenses have not been removed from foreign per diem rates established by the Department of State, or from non-foreign area per diem rates established by the Department of Defense. Separate claims for laundry and dry cleaning expenses incurred in foreign areas and non-foreign areas are not allowed.
