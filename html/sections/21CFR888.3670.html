                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A shoulder joint metal/polymer/metal  nonconstrained or semi-constrained porous-coated uncemented prosthesis  is a device intended to be implanted to replace a shoulder joint. The  device limits movement in one or more planes. It has no linkage across- the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have a  humeral component made of alloys such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (Co- Cr-Mo) and titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys, and a glenoid  resurfacing component made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene,  or a combination of an articulating ultra-high molecular weight bearing  surface fixed in a metal shell made of alloys such as Co-Cr-Mo and Ti- 6Al-4V. The humeral component and glenoid backing have a porous coating  made of, in the case of Co-Cr-Mo components, beads of the same alloy or  commercially pure titanium powder, and in the case of Ti-6Al-4V  components, beads or fibers of commercially pure titanium or Ti-6Al-4V  alloy, or commercially pure titanium powder. The porous coating has a  volume porosity between 30 and 70 percent, an average pore size between  100 and 1,000 microns, interconnecting porosity, and a porous coating  thickness between 500 and 1,500 microns. This generic type of device is  designed to achieve biological fixation to bone without the use of bone  cement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control  for this device is FDA's ``Class II Special Controls Guidance: Shoulder  Joint Metal/Polymer/Metal Nonconstrained or Semi-Constrained Porous- Coated Uncemented Prosthesis.''
