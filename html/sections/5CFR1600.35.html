The election must be made on the TSP's refund request form and must be received by the TSP's record keeper prior to the expiration of the 90-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The distribution of a refund will be reported as income to the participant on IRS Form 1099-R, but it will not be subject to the additional tax under 26 U.S.C. 72(t) (the early withdrawal penalty tax).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A participant who requests a refund will receive the amount of any default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Processing of refunds will be subject to the rules set out at 5 CFR part 1650.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A participant will no longer be considered to be covered by the automatic enrollment program if the participant files a contribution election. Consequently, if a participant makes a

contribution election during the 90-day period, the participant will only be eligible to receive as a refund an amount equal to his or her default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the expiration of the period allowed for the refund, any withdrawal must be made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8433 and 5 CFR part 1650.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A married participant may request a refund of default employee contributions without obtaining the consent of his or her spouse or having the TSP notify the spouse of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The rules applicable to frozen accounts (5 CFR 1650.3) and applicable to deceased participants (5 CFR 1650.6) also apply to refunds of the default employee contributions.</p>
