                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Objective. The Capital Fund program indicator examines the period of time taken by a PHA to obligate funds and occupy units in relation to statutory deadlines for obligation for all Capital Fund program grants for which fund balances remain during the assessed fiscal year. Funds from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) do not include HOPE VI program funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This indicator is applicable on a PHA-wide basis, and not to individual projects. This indicator is not applicable to PHAs that choose not to participate in the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Capital Fund subindicators. The subindicators pursuant to section 9(d) of the Act are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timeliness of fund obligation. This subindicator examines the period of time it takes for a PHA to obligate funds from the Capital Fund program

under section 9(j)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(9)(j)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Occupancy rate. This subindicator measures the PHA's occupancy rate as of the end of the PHA's fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Method of assessment. The assessment required under the Capital Fund program indicator will be performed through analysis of obligated amounts in HUD's eLOCCS (or its successor) for all Capital Fund program grants that were open during the assessed fiscal year. This subindicator measures a statutory requirement for the Capital Fund program. Other aspects of the Capital Fund program will be monitored by HUD through other types of reviews, and in this indicator through considering occupancy rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PHAs are responsible to ensure that their Capital Fund program information is submitted to eLOCCS by the submission due date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS and/or the PIC systems by the submission due date.</p>
