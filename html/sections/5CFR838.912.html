                                Sec. 838.912  Specifying an award of a former spouse survivor annuity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To satisfy the requirements of Sec. 838.804(b)(2), a court  order must specify that it is awarding a former spouse survivor annuity.  The court order must contain language such as ``survivor annuity,''  ``death benefits,'' ``former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C.  8341(h)(1),'' etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A court order that provides that the former spouse is to  ``continue as'' or ``be named as'' the beneficiary of CSRS survivor  benefits or similar language satisfies the requirements of Sec.  838.804(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS or  FERS survivor annuity or the FERS basic employee death benefit as  defined in Sec. 843.102 of this chapter at the time of the divorce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by  retiring employees to cover former spouses. Under CSRS, section 8341(h)  of title 5, United States Code, provides for ``former spouse survivor  annuities'' and section 8339(k) of title 5, United States Code, provides  for ``insurable interest annuities.'' These are distinct benefits, each  with its own advantages. The corresponding FERS provisions are sections  8445 and 8444, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OPM will enforce court orders to provide section 8341(h) or  section 8445 annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have  fewer restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former  spouse's interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before  age 55. To provide a section 8341(h) or section 8445 annuity, the court  order must use terms such as ``former spouse survivor annuity,''  ``section 8341(h) annuity,'' or ``survivor annuity.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In court orders which contain internal contradictions about the  type of annuity, such as ``insurable interest annuity under section  8341(h),'' the section reference will control.
