                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Director or his or her designee may issue a  temporary cease-and-desist order if he or she determines that one or  more of the alleged violations specified in a notice of charges, or the  continuation thereof, is likely to cause the respondent to be insolvent  or otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers before the completion  of the adjudication proceeding. A temporary cease-and-desist order may  require the respondent to cease and desist from any violation or  practice specified in the notice of charges and to take affirmative  action to prevent or remedy such insolvency or other condition pending  completion of the proceedings initiated by the issuance of a notice of  charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incomplete or inaccurate records. When a notice of charges  specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that the  books and records of a respondent are so incomplete or inaccurate that  the Bureau is unable to determine the financial condition of the  respondent or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions  that may have a material effect on the financial condition of the  respondent,   then the Director or his or her designee may issue a temporary order  requiring:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise,  whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of  the books or records; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affirmative action to restore such books or records to a  complete and accurate state, until the completion of the adjudication  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content, scope and form of order. Every temporary cease-and- desist order accompanying a notice of charges shall describe:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis for its issuance, including the alleged violations and  the harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The act or acts the respondent is to take or refrain from  taking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective and enforceable upon service. A temporary cease-and- desist order is effective and enforceable upon service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. Service of a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be  made pursuant to Sec. 1081.113(d).</p>
