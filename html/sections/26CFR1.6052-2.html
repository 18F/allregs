Every employer filing a return under section 6052(a) and Sec. 1.6052-1 with respect to group-term life insurance on the life of an employee shall furnish to the employee whose name is set forth in such return a written statement showing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of statement. The written statement required to be furnished to an employee under paragraph (a) of this section shall show:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount includible in the employee's gross income by reason of the provisions of section 79(a), but determined as if the employer furnishing such statement is the only employer paying the employee remuneration in the form of group-term life insurance on his life which is includible in his gross income under section 79(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, and identifying number of the employer filing the statement.

The requirement of this section for the furnishing of a statement to an employee may be satisfied by the furnishing to such employee of a copy of the return filed pursuant to Sec. 1.6052-1 in respect of such employee. A statement shall be considered to be furnished to a person within the meaning of this section if it is mailed to such person at his last known address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for furnishing statements--(1) In general. Each statement required by this section to be furnished to any employee for a calendar year shall be furnished to such person after the close of that year and on or before January 31 of the following year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Each statement required by this section to be furnished to any employee for a calendar year shall be furnished to such person after the close of that year and on or before January 31 of the following year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extensions of time. For good cause shown upon written application of the employer required to furnish statements under this section, the district director may grant an extension of time not exceeding 30 days in which to furnish such statements. The application shall be addressed to the district director with whom the income tax returns of the applicant are filed and shall contain a full recital of the reasons for requesting the extension to aid the district director in determining the period of the extension, if any, which will be granted. Such a request in the form of a letter to the district director signed by the applicant will suffice as an application. The application shall be filed on or before the date prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for furnishing the statements required by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Last day for furnishing statement. For provisions relating to the time for performance of an act when the last day prescribed for performance falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, see Sec. 301.7503-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule where Form W-2 is used. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The requirement of this section for the furnishing of a statement to an employee may be satisfied by furnishing to such employee the employee's copy of Form W-2 filed pursuant to Sec. 1.6052-1 in respect of such employee. In a case where the statement furnished by an employer to an employee for purposes of complying with this section is the employee's copy of a Form W-2, then the rules in Sec. 31.6051-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations) shall apply with respect to the means and time (including extensions thereof) for furnishing such statements to the employee and making corrections on such form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. Terms used in this section and in section 79 and the regulations thereunder have the meaning ascribed to them in section 79 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Penalty. For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish a statement under this section, see section 6678 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rule for calendar years before 1972. For calendar years before 1972, the provisions of this section will be deemed to have been complied with if the statements for such years were furnished in accordance with the provisions of this section in effect prior to August 3, 1973, or with the instructions applicable to the appropriate forms.
