                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Most rules of local applicability are issued by District  Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers while  rules of wider applicability are issued by senior Coast Guard officials  at Coast Guard Headquarters. For both significant rulemaking (defined by  Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review) and non- significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to District  Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers the  regulatory process begins when an office chief with program  responsibilities identifies a possible need for a new regulation or for  changes to an existing regulation. The need may arise due to statutory  changes, or be based on internal review or public input. Early public  involvement is strongly encouraged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After a tentative significant regulatory approach is developed,  a significant regulatory project proposal is submitted to the Marine  Safety and Security Council for approval. The proposal describes the  scope of the proposed regulation, alternatives considered, and potential  cost and benefits, including possible environmental impacts. All  significant regulatory projects require   Marine Safety and Security Council approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Significant rulemaking documents must also be approved by the  Commandant of the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted,  including documents to be published in the Federal Register. These may  include regulatory evaluations, environmental analyses, requests for  comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed  rulemakings, and final rules.
