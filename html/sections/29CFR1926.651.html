atmospheres. These precautions include providing proper respiratory protection or ventilation in accordance with subparts D and E of this part respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adequate precaution shall be taken such as providing ventilation, to prevent employee exposure to an atmosphere containing a concentration of a flammable gas in excess of 20 percent of the lower flammable limit of the gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When controls are used that are intended to reduce the level of atmospheric contaminants to acceptable levels, testing shall be conducted as often as necessary to ensure that the atmosphere remains safe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emergency rescue equipment.
