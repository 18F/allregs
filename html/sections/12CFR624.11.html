                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Affiliates. This part applies to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap of a covered swap entity with its affiliate, unless the swap or security-based swap is excluded from

coverage under Sec. 624.1(d) or as otherwise provided in this section. To the extent of any inconsistency between this section and any other provision of this part, this section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial margin--(1) Posting of initial margin. The requirement for a covered swap entity to post initial margin under Sec. 624.3(b) does not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate. A covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin that would be required to be posted to an affiliate that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure pursuant to Sec. 624.3(b) and provide documentation of such amount to each affiliate on a daily basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial margin threshold amount. For purposes of calculating the amount of initial margin to be collected from an affiliate counterparty in accordance with Sec. 624.3(a) or calculating the amount of initial margin that would have been posted to an affiliate counterparty in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the initial margin threshold amount is an aggregate credit exposure of $20 million resulting from all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between the covered swap entity and that affiliate. For purposes of this calculation, an entity shall not count a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to Sec. 624.1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Variation margin. A covered swap entity shall collect and post variation margin with respect to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with any counterparty that is an affiliate as provided in Sec. 624.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Custodian for non-cash collateral. To the extent that a covered swap entity collects initial margin required by Sec. 624.3(a) from an affiliate with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap in the form of collateral other than cash collateral, the custodian for such collateral may be the covered swap entity or an affiliate of the covered swap entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Model holding period and netting--(1) Model holding period. For any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (or netting portfolio) between a covered swap entity and an affiliate that would be subject to the clearing requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 or section 3C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but for an exemption under section 2(h)(7)(C)(iii) or (D) or section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 or regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or section 3C(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the covered swap entity's initial margin model calculation as described in Sec. 624.8(d)(1) may use a holding period equal to the shorter of five business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (or netting portfolio).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Netting arrangements. Any netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a model holding period equal to the shorter of five business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be identified and separate from any other netting portfolio for purposes of calculating and complying with the initial margin requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Standardized amounts. If a covered swap entity's initial margin model does not conform to the requirements of Sec. 624.8, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given affiliate counterparty pursuant to section Sec. 624.3 on a daily basis pursuant to appendix A with the gross initial margin multiplied by 0.7.</p>
