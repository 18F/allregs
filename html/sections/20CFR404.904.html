The written notice will explain in simple and  clear language what we have determined and the reasons for and the  effect of our determination. If our determination involves a  determination of disability that is in whole or in part unfavorable to  you, our written notice also will contain in understandable language a  statement of the case setting forth the evidence on which our  determination is based. The notice also will inform you of your right to  reconsideration. We will not mail a notice if the beneficiary's  entitlement to benefits has ended because of his or her death.
