                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Normally, distress calls received using digital selective calling are only acknowledged using a DSC acknowledgement by a coast station. Ships should delay any acknowledgement in order to give sufficient time for a coast station to acknowledge the call. In cases where no acknowledgement has been heard and no distress traffic has been heard, the ship should transmit a distress alert relay to the coast station. Upon advice from the Rescue Coordination Center, the ship may transmit a DSC acknowledgement call to stop it from being repeated. Acknowledgement by digital selective calling of receipt of a distress alert in the terrestrial services must comply with ITU-R M.541-9 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 80.7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acknowledgement through a satellite of receipt of a distress alert from a ship earth station must be sent immediately (see Sec. 80.1119).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acknowledgement by radiotelephony of receipt of a distress alert from a ship station or a ship earth station must be given in the following form:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The distress signal MAYDAY;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The call sign or other identification of the station sending the distress message, spoken three times;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The words THIS IS (or DE spoken as DELTA ECHO in case of language difficulties);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The call sign or other identification of the station acknowledging receipt, spoken three times;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The word RECEIVED (or RRR spoken as ROMEO ROMEO ROMEO in case of language difficulties);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The distress signal MAYDAY.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of a distress alert from a ship station must be given in the following form:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The distress signal MAYDAY;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The call sign or other identification of the station sending the distress alert;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The word DE;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The call sign or other identification of the station acknowledging receipt of the distress alert;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The signal RRR;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The distress signal MAYDAY.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The acknowledgement by direct-printing telegraphy of receipt of a distress alert from a ship earth station must be given by the coast earth station receiving the distress alert by retransmitting the ship station identity of the ship transmitting the distress alert.
