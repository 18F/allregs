(Core science courses include, but are not limited to, biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second priority will be given to applicants who have completed four core science courses, as defined above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third priority will be given to applicants who are matriculated freshmen or sophomores.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Selection. In selecting participants and determining continuation of program support, the Director will take into consideration those factors determined necessary to ensure effective participation in the Scholarship Program.

Any scholarship payments suspended under this paragraph will be resumed by the Director upon notification by the school that the participant has returned from the leave-of-absence or has completed the repeated course work and is pursuing as a full-time student the course of study for which the scholarship was awarded.

Sec.  68b.9  What will happen if an individual does not comply with the terms and conditions of participating in the Scholarship Program?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When a participant fails to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing, is dismissed from the school for disciplinary reasons, or voluntarily terminates the course of study or program for which the scholarship was awarded before completing the course of study or program, the participant must, instead of performing any service obligation, pay to the United States an amount equal to all scholarship funds awarded under Sec.  68b.6. Payment of this amount must be made within 3 years of the date the participant becomes liable to make payment under this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If, for any reason not specified in Sec.  68b.11(b), a participant fails to begin or complete the period of obligated service incurred under Sec.  68b.7, including failing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of a deferment granted by the Director, the participant must pay to the United States an amount determined by the penalties set forth in section 487D(e) of the Act.

Sec.  68b.10  When can a Scholarship Program payment obligation be discharged in bankruptcy?</p><p class="depth0">Any payment obligation incurred under Sec.  68b.9 may be discharged in

bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code only if such discharge is granted after the expiration of the seven-year period beginning on the first date that payment is required and only if the bankruptcy court finds that a nondischarge of the obligation would be unconscionable.


Sec.  68b.11  Under what circumstances can the service or payment obligation be canceled, waived, or suspended?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any obligation of a participant for service or payment to the federal government under this part will be canceled upon the death of the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Director may waive or suspend any service or payment obligation incurred by the participant upon request whenever compliance by the participant:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is impossible, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Would involve extreme hardship, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Would involve extreme hardship, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If enforcement of the service or payment obligation would be unconscionable, as required by section 487 D(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 288-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Director may approve a request for a suspension of the service or payment obligations for a period of one year. A renewal of this suspension may also be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compliance by a participant with a service or payment obligation will be considered impossible if the Director determines, on the basis of information and documentation as may be required, that the participant suffers from a physical or mental disability resulting in the permanent inability of the participant to perform the service or other activities that would be necessary to comply with the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In determining whether to waive or suspend any or all of the service or payment obligations of a participant as imposing an undue hardship and being against equity and good conscience, the Director, on the basis of information and documentation as may be required, will consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The participant's present financial resources and obligations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The participant's estimated future financial resources and obligations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the participant has problems of a personal nature, such as physical or mental disability or terminal illness in the immediate family, which so intrude on the participant's present and future ability to perform as to raise a presumption that the individual will be unable to begin or complete the obligation incurred.


Sec.  68b.12  What other regulations and statutes apply?</p><p class="depth0">Several other regulations and statutes apply to this part. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3701 note);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 176); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER F_QUARANTINE, INSPECTION, LICENSING</p>
