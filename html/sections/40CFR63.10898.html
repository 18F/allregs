You must conduct the test within 180 days of your compliance date and report the results in your notification of compliance status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you own or operate an existing iron and steel foundry, you may choose to submit the results of a prior performance test for PM or total metal HAP that demonstrates compliance with the applicable emissions limit for a metal melting furnace or group of all metal melting furnaces provided the test was conducted within the last 5 years using the methods and procedures specified in this subpart and either no process changes have been made since the test, or you can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance with the applicable emissions limit despite such process changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you own or operate an existing iron and steel foundry and you choose to submit the results of a prior performance test according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must submit a written notification to the Administrator of your intent to use the previous test data no later than 60 days after your compliance date. The notification must contain a full copy of the performance test and contain information to demonstrate, if applicable, that either no process changes have been made since the test, or that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite such process changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you have an electric induction furnace equipped with an emissions control device at an existing foundry, you may use the test results from another electric induction furnace to demonstrate compliance with the applicable PM or total metal HAP emissions limit in Sec. 63.10895(c) provided the furnaces are similar with respect to the type of emission control device that is used, the composition of the scrap charged, furnace size, and furnace melting temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you have an uncontrolled electric induction furnace at an existing foundry, you may use the test results from another electric induction furnace to demonstrate compliance with the applicable PM or total metal HAP emissions limit in Sec. 63.10895(c) provided the test results are prior to any control device and the electric induction furnaces are similar with respect to the composition of the scrap charged, furnace size, and furnace melting temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For electric induction furnaces that do not have emission capture systems, you may install a temporary enclosure for the purpose of representative sampling of emissions. A permanent enclosure and capture system is not required for the purpose of the performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must conduct subsequent performance tests to demonstrate compliance with all applicable PM or total metal HAP emissions limits in Sec. 63.10895(c) for a metal melting furnace or group of all metal melting furnaces no less frequently than every 5 years and each time you elect to change an operating limit or make a process change likely to increase HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1), Table 1 to this subpart, and paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To determine compliance with the applicable PM or total metal HAP emissions limit in Sec. 63.10895(c) for a metal melting furnace in a lb/ton of metal charged format, compute the process-weighted mass emissions (E\p\) for each test run using Equation 1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA08.000
