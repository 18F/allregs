In deciding whether to initiate lease cancellation proceedings under this subsection, the Secretary shall not consider adverse circumstances which arise out of (1) normally foreseeable costs of compliance with requirements for environmental protection; (2) commonly experienced delays in delivery of supplies or equipment; or (3) inability to obtain sufficient sales.
