                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to  protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary directs a guaranty  agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loans held by the agency  on which the agency has received payment under Sec. 682.402(f),  682.402(k), or 682.404. The collection of unpaid loans owed by Federal  employees by Federal salary offset is, among other things, deemed to be  in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless the Secretary notifies an agency,  in writing, that other loans must be assigned to the Secretary, an  agency must assign any loan that meets all of the following criteria as  of April 15 of each year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unpaid principal balance is at least $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in  which these regulations are effective, the loan, and any other loans  held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the   agency for at least four years; for any subsequent fiscal year such loan  must have been held by the agency for at least five years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the  borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em> or (a)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate. A fiscal  year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the  amount collected on defaulted loans, including collections by Federal  Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford,  PLUS, SLS, and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of  that program (including payments received by the agency on loans under  Sec. 682.401(b)(1) and Sec. 682.409 and the amounts of any loans  purchased from the guaranty agency by an eligible lender) during the  most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of  principal and interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each  loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts  permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If, in each  of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these  regulations are effective, the fiscal year loan type recovery rate for a  loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery  rate of all active guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal  years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that  additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal  interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional  assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate  standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average recovery  rate of all active guaranty agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of  this section that protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires  that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an  agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate described in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a  sufficient amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be  assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to cause  the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year  to equal or exceed the average rate of all agencies described in  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from  the denominator of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the  amount of these additional loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may  require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section to include particular categories of loans that share  characteristics that make the performance of the agency fall below the  appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards. The  Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second  quarterly report from all agencies, makes available to all agencies a  mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the  average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies for each loan  type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning of  each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and  the average rate for each loan type for the preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal  interest requires assignments. Upon petition by an agency submitted  within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of   this section, the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal  fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans described in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount  described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section only after review of  the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary  considers all relevant information available to him (including any  information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in reviews of  the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in  which these regulations are effective, the Secretary considers  information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery  rate above the average rate of all active agencies to demonstrate that  the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any  amounts of loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the  Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained by that  agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers  information presented by an agency with a fiscal year recovery rate 10  percent above the average rate of all active agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that  is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to  demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be  served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with Sec.  682.401(b)(1) and Sec. 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal  year loan type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required  to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs  (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include, but is not limited to  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fiscal year loan type recovery rate within such school  sectors as the Secretary may designate for the agency, and for all  agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fiscal year loan type recovery rate for loans for the agency  and for all agencies categorized by age of the loans as the Secretary  may determine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The performance of the agency, and all agencies, in default  aversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The agency's performance on judgment enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The existence and use of any state or guaranty agency-specific  collection tools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other factors that may affect loan repayment such as State or  regional unemployment and natural disasters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Denial of an agency's petition. If the Secretary does not  accept the agency's petition, the Secretary provides, in writing, to the  agency the Secretary's reasons for concluding that the Federal fiscal  interest is best protected by requiring the assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A guaranty agency that assigns a defaulted loan to the  Secretary under this section thereby releases all rights and title to  that loan. The Secretary does not pay the guaranty agency any  compensation for a loan assigned under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The guaranty agency does not share in any amounts received by  the Secretary on a loan assigned under this section, regardless of the  reinsurance percentage paid on the loan or the agency's previous  collection costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A guaranty agency must assign a loan to the Secretary under  this section at the time, in the manner, and with the information and  documentation that the Secretary requires. The agency must submit this  information and documentation in the form (including magnetic media) and  format specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The guaranty agency must execute an assignment to the United  States of America of all right, title, and interest in the promissory  note or judgment evidencing a loan assigned under this section. If more  than one loan is made under an MPN, the assignment of the note only  applies to the loan or loans being assigned to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the agency does not provide the required information and  documentation in the form and format required by the Secretary, the  Secretary may, at his option--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allow the agency to revise the agency's submission to include  the required information and documentation in the specified form and  format;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an improperly formatted computer tape, reformat  the tape and assess the cost of the activity against the agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reorganize the material submitted and assess the cost of that  activity against the agency; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Obtain from other agency records and add to the agency's  submission any information from the original submission, and assess the  cost of that activity against the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each loan assigned, the agency shall submit to the Secretary  the following documents associated for each loan, assembled in the order  listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The original or a true and exact copy of the promissory note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any documentation of a judgment entered on the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A written assignment of the loan or judgment, unless this  assignment is affixed to the promissory note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The loan application, if a separate application was provided to  the lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A payment history for the loan, as described in Sec.  682.414(a)(1)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A collection history for the loan, as described in Sec.  682.414(a)(1)(ii)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The record of the lender's disbursement of Stafford and PLUS  loan funds to the school for delivery to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If the MPN or promissory note was signed electronically, the  name and location of the entity in possession of the original electronic  MPN or promissory note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The agency may submit copies of required documents in lieu of  originals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Secretary may accept the assignment of a loan without all of  the documents listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If directed to  do so, the agency must retain these documents for submission to the  Secretary at some future date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Secretary determines that the agency has not submitted  a document or record required by paragraph (c) of this section, and the  Secretary decides to allow the agency an additional opportunity to  submit the omitted document under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,  the Secretary notifies the agency and provides a reasonable period of  time for the agency to submit the omitted record or document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the omitted document is not submitted within the time  specified by the Secretary, the Secretary determines whether that  omission impairs the Secretary's ability to collect the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary reassigns to the agency that portion of the loan  determined to be unenforceable by the Department.
