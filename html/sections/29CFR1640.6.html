                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency determination of jurisdiction. Upon receipt of a  complaint of employment discrimination, an agency other than the EEOC  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine whether it has jurisdiction over the complaint under  section 504 or under title II of the ADA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine whether the EEOC may have jurisdiction over the  complaint under title I of the ADA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral to the Civil Rights Division. If the agency determines  that it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 or title II, and  determines that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction under title I, the  agency shall promptly refer the complaint to the Civil Rights Division.  The Civil Rights Division shall determine if another Federal agency may  have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 or title II, and,  if so, shall promptly refer the complaint to a section 504 or a  designated agency with jurisdiction over the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Referral to the EEOC--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referral by an agency without  jurisdiction. If an agency determines that it does not have jurisdiction  over a complaint of employment discrimination under either section 504  or title II and determines that the EEOC may have jurisdiction under  title I, the agency shall promptly refer the complaint to the EEOC for  investigation and processing under title I of the ADA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referral by a section 504 agency. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A section 504 agency that  otherwise has jurisdiction over a complaint of employment discrimination  under section 504 shall promptly refer to the EEOC, for investigation  and processing under title I of the ADA, any complaint of employment  discrimination that solely alleges discrimination against an individual  (and that does not allege discrimination in both employment and in other  practices or services of the respondent or a pattern or practice of  employment discrimination), unless:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The section 504 agency determines that the EEOC does not have  jurisdiction over the complaint under title I; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The EEOC has jurisdiction over the complaint under title I, but  the complainant, either independently, or following receipt of the  notification letter required to be sent to the complainant pursuant to  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, specifically requests that the  complaint be investigated by the section 504 agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to referring an individual complaint of employment  discrimination to the EEOC pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section (but not prior to making such a referral pursuant to paragraph  (c)(1) of this section), a section 504 agency that otherwise has  jurisdiction over the complaint shall promptly notify the complainant,  in writing, of its intention to make such a referral. The notice letter  shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Inform the complainant that, unless the agency receives a  written request from the complainant within twenty days of the date of  the notice letter requesting that the agency retain the complaint for  investigation, the agency will forward the complaint to the EEOC for  investigation and processing; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Describe the basic procedural differences between an  investigation under section 504 and an investigation under title I, and  inform the complainant of the potential for differing remedies under  each statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Referral by a designated agency. A designated agency that does  not have section 504 jurisdiction over a complaint of employment  discrimination and that has determined that the EEOC may have  jurisdiction over the complaint under title I shall promptly refer the  complaint to the EEOC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Processing of complaints referred to the EEOC. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A complaint  referred to the EEOC in accordance with this section by an agency with  jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 shall be deemed to be  a dual-filed complaint under section 504 and title I. When a section 504  agency with jurisdiction over a complaint refers the complaint to the  EEOC, the section 504 agency shall defer its processing of the complaint  pursuant to Sec. 1640.10, pending resolution by the EEOC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A complaint referred to the EEOC by an agency that has  jurisdiction over the complaint solely under title II (and not under  section 504) will be treated as a complaint filed under title I only.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any complaint referred to the EEOC pursuant to this section  shall be processed by the EEOC under its title I procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention by the agency for investigation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retention by a  section 504 agency. A section 504 agency shall retain a complaint for  investigation when the agency determines that it has jurisdiction over  the complaint under section 504, and one or more of the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under  title I; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The complaint alleges discrimination in both employment and in   other practices or services of the respondent that are covered by  section 504; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The complaint alleges a pattern or practice of employment  discrimination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retention by a designated agency. A designated agency that does  not have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 shall retain  a complaint for investigation when the agency determines that it has  jurisdiction over the complaint under title II of the ADA and that the  EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under title I.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Processing of complaints retained by an agency. Any complaint  retained for investigation and processing by an agency pursuant to  paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section will be investigated and  processed under section 504, title II, or both, as applicable, and will  not be considered to be dual filed under title I.</p>
