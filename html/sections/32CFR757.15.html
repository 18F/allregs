                            <p class="depth0">In some cases, public policy considerations limit the DoN's assertion of claims against apparent third-party tortfeasors or a contract where the Government would be a third party beneficiary. Claims are not asserted against:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal Government agencies. Claims are not asserted against any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States. ``Agency or instrumentality'' includes self-insured, non-appropriated-fund activities but does not include private associations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Injured service members, dependents, and employees of the United States. Claims are not asserted directly against a servicemember, the dependent of a servicemember, or an employee of the United States who is injured as a result of his own willful or negligent acts. The United States does assert, however, against policies that cover the injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employers of merchant seamen. Claims are not asserted against the employer of a merchant seaman who receives Federal medical care under 42 U.S.C. 249.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Department of Veterans' Affairs care for service-connected disability. Claims are not asserted for care provided to a veteran by the Department of Veterans' Affairs when the care is for a service-connected disability. The United States will, however, claim for the reasonable value of care provided

an individual before he is transferred to a Department of Veterans' Affairs hospital. This policy does not apply in cases where the MTF referred the patient to the Veterans' Affairs hospital and then paid for the care.
