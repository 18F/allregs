                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recommended decision. Within 30 days of the hearing, the  designated FCA representative shall make a recommendation with findings  and conclusions to the Board concerning the notice or order of  suspension, removal, or prohibition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final decision. Within 60 days of the hearing, the Board shall  notify the subject individual and the FCA's Office of General Counsel  whether the suspension or removal from office, or prohibition from  participation in any manner in the affairs of the institution, will be  continued, terminated, or otherwise modified. The Board's final  decision, if adverse to the individual, shall contain a statement of the  basis thereof. The Board may satisfy this requirement where it adopts  the recommended decision of the designated FCA representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guilt not an issue. In deciding upon any suspension of  prohibition by notice, the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence  of the individual with respect to the criminal charge that is  outstanding will not be considered. A finding of not guilty or other  disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from thereafter  instituting removal proceedings pursuant to section 5.28 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective period. A removal or prohibition by order remains in  effect until terminated by the Board. A suspension or prohibition by  notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is finally disposed  of or until terminated by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reconsideration. A suspended or removed individual may petition  the Board to reconsider the decision any time after the expiration of a  12-month period from the date of the decision, but no petition for  reconsideration may be made within 12 months of a previous petition. A  petition shall state with particularity the relief sought and the  grounds therefor and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and  any other documentation the petitioner wishes to have considered. No  hearing need be granted on the petition for reconsideration.     Secs. 622.83-622.100  [Reserved]</p>
