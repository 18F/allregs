                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A.T.A. carnet. The A.T.A. carnet is acceptable for goods to be  temporarily entered, or temporarily entered and transported, under:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Customs Convention on the Temporary Importation of  Professional Equipment, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The International Convention to Facilitate the Importation of  Commercial Samples and Advertising Material, which includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial samples, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Motion picture advertising films not exceeding 16 mm.,  consisting essentially of photographs (with or without sound track)  showing the nature or operation of products or equipment whose qualities  cannot be adequately demonstrated by samples or catalogs. There shall be  presented with each carnet covering motion picture advertising films a  statement showing how each of the following requirements is met. The  films must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Relate to products or equipment offered for sale or for hire by  a person established in the territory of another contracting party;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Be of a kind suitable for exhibition to the public; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Be imported in a packet which contains not more than one copy of  each film and which does not form part of a larger consignment of films.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TIR carnet--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use. The TIR carnet may be accepted at any port  of entry for the transport of merchandise in road vehicles or in  containers, even if the containers, without being loaded on road  vehicles, are carried by other means of transport for part of the  journey between the customs offices of departure and destination. The  TIR carnet may also be accepted for the transport of ``heavy or bulky  goods'' as defined in Article 1 of the TIR Convention. The TIR carnet  covers the transportation of merchandise for customs purposes only. Road  vehicles transporting merchandise under cover of a TIR carnet must also  comply with all other applicable requirements of Federal and State  agencies concerned with the regulations of such vehicles and their  personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taken on charge. A TIR carnet is ``taken on charge'' by Customs  when it is accepted as a transportation entry and when the shipment  covered thereby is receipted for by the bonded carrier (see Sec. Sec.  18.1, 18.2, and 18.10(a) of this chapter). Until the carnet is ``taken  on charge,'' the guaranteeing association shall have no liability to the  United States under the carnet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> TECRO/AIT carnet--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use. The TECRO/AIT carnet is acceptable  for the following two categories of goods to be temporarily imported,  unless importation is prohibited under the laws and regulations of the  United States:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Professional equipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commercial samples and advertising material imported for the  purpose of being shown or demonstrated with a view to soliciting orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issue and use. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issuing associations shall indicate on the  cover of the TECRO/AIT carnet the customs territory in which it is valid  and the name and address of the guaranteeing association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period fixed for re-exportation of goods imported under  cover of   a TECRO/AIT carnet shall not in any case exceed the period of validity  of that carnet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Excess liability. When the total of duties and taxes on any  shipment covered by a carnet exceeds the amount for which the  guaranteeing association is liable, the excess constitutes a charge  against the carrier's bond.
