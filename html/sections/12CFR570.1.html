                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. This part and the Guidelines in Appendices A and B to this part are issued by the OTS under section 39 (section 39) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831p-1) as added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991)), and as amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992)), and as amended by section 318 of the Community Development Banking Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994)). Appendix B to this part is further issued under sections 501(b) and 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. Section 39 of the FDI Act requires the OTS to establish safety and soundness standards. Pursuant to section 39, a savings association may be required to submit a compliance plan if it is not in compliance with a safety and soundness standard established by guideline under section 39 (a) or (b). An enforceable order under section 8 of the FDI Act may be issued if, after being notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard prescribed under section 39, the savings association fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan. This part establishes procedures for submission and review of safety and soundness compliance plans and for issuance and review of orders pursuant to section 39. Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness pursuant to section 39 of the FDI Act are set forth in Appendix A to this part. Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards are set forth in appendix B to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This part and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness as set forth at appendix A to this part and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards at appendix B to this part implement the provisions of section 39 of the FDI Act as they apply to savings associations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preservation of existing authority. Neither section 39 of the FDI Act nor this part in any way limits the authority of the OTS under any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 39 and this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the OTS.
