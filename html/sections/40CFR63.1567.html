                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What emission limitations and work practice standards must I meet? You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet each emission limitation in Table 22 to this subpart that applies to you. If you operate a catalytic reforming unit in which different reactors in the catalytic reforming unit are regenerated in separate regeneration systems, then these emission limitations apply to each separate regeneration system. These emission limitations apply to emissions from catalytic reforming unit process vents associated with the coke burn-off and catalyst rejuvenation operations during coke burn-off and catalyst regeneration. You can choose from the two options in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You can elect to meet a percent reduction standard for hydrogen chloride (HCl) emissions (Option 1); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You can elect to meet an HCl concentration limit (Option 2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet each site-specific operating limit in Table 23 of this subpart that applies to you. These operating limits apply during coke burn-off and catalyst rejuvenation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepare an operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan according to the requirements in Sec. 63.1574(f) and operate at all times according to the procedures in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standard?

Where:CHCl,ppmvLimit = Maximum permissible HCl concentration for</p><p class="depth4">the HCl concentration operating limit, ppmv;CHCl,AveTube = Average HCl concentration from the colormetric</p><p class="depth4">tube sampling system, calculated as the arithmetic average of</p><p class="depth4">the average HCl concentration measured for each performance</p><p class="depth4">test run, ppmv or 1 ppmv, whichever is greater; andCHCl,RegLimit = Maximum permissible outlet HCl concentration</p><p class="depth4">for the applicable catalytic reforming unit as listed in Table</p><p class="depth4">22 of this subpart, either 10 or 30 ppmv.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If you are required to use a colormetric tube sampling system to demonstrate continuous compliance with the percent reduction operating limit, calculate the HCl operating limit using Equation 5 of this section as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE05.007
