                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Other test equipment used for testing shall be calibrated as often as

required by the instrument manufacturer or necessary according to good practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a methane analyzer is used, the methane analyzer shall be calibrated prior to introduction into service and monthly thereafter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the methane analyzer with zero-grade air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each normally used operating range with CH4 in air with nominal concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at least six incremental steps to 90 percent (e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent) of that range. The incremental steps are to be spaced to represent good engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or less of the value at each non-zero data point and within [0.3 percent of full scale on the zero, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds these limits, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within these limits shall be used to determine concentration.
