                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may average, bank, and trade (ABT) emission credits for  purposes of certification as described in this subpart to show  compliance with the standards of this part. This applies for engines  with respect to exhaust emissions and for vessels with respect to  evaporative emissions. Participation in this program is voluntary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The definitions of subpart I of this part apply to this subpart.  The following definitions also apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Actual emission credits means emission credits you have  generated that we have verified by reviewing your final report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Averaging set means a set of engines (or vessels) in which  emission credits may be exchanged only with other engines (or vessels)  in the same averaging set.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Broker means any entity that facilitates a trade of emission  credits between a buyer and seller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Buyer means the entity that receives emission credits as a  result of a trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Family means engine family for exhaust credits or emission  family for evaporative credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reserved emission credits means emission credits you have  generated that we have not yet verified by reviewing your final report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Seller means the entity that provides emission credits during a  trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Standard means the emission standard that applies under subpart  B of this part for engines or fuel-system components not participating  in the ABT program of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Trade means to exchange emission credits, either as a buyer or  seller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may not average or exchange banked or traded exhaust credits  with evaporative credits, or vice versa. Evaporative credits generated  by any vessels under this part may be used by any vessels under this  part. Exhaust credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set.  Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the following  criteria define the applicable exhaust averaging sets:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sterndrive/inboard engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outboard and personal watercraft engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> may not be greater than the  U.S.-directed sales of the same engine model for outboard or personal  watercraft engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not generate evaporative credits based on permeation  measurements from metal fuel tanks or portable marine fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may not use emission credits generated under this subpart to  offset any emissions that exceed an FEL or standard. This applies for  all testing, including certification testing, in-use testing, selective  enforcement audits, and other production-line testing. However, if  exhaust emissions from an engine exceed an exhaust FEL or standard (for  example, during a selective enforcement audit), you may use emission  credits to recertify the family with a higher FEL that applies only to  future production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Emission credits may be used for averaging in the model year  they are generated or banked for averaging in future model years, except  that CO emission credits for outboard and personal watercraft engines  may not be banked or traded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You may increase or decrease an exhaust FEL during the model  year by amending your application for certification under Sec.   1045.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Engine and vessel manufacturers certifying with respect to  evaporative emissions may use emission credits to demonstrate compliance  under this subpart. Component manufacturers may establish FELs for their  certified products, but they may not generate or use emission credits  under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In your application for certification, base your showing of  compliance on projected production volumes for engines or vessels  intended for sale in the United States. As described in Sec.  1045.730,  compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined at the  end of the model year based on actual production volumes for engines or  vessels intended for sale in the United States. Do not include any of  the following engines or vessels to calculate emission credits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines or vessels exempted under subpart G of this part or  under 40 CFR part 1068.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engines or vessels intended for export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engines or vessels that are subject to state emission standards  for that model year. However, this restriction does not apply if we  determine that the state standards and requirements are equivalent to  those of this part and that products sold in such a state will not  generate credits under the state program. For example, you may not  include engines or vessels certified for California if California has  more stringent emission standards for these products or if your products  generate or use emission credits under the California program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engines or vessels not subject to the requirements of this part,  such as those excluded under Sec.  1045.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other engines or vessels where we indicate elsewhere in this  part 1045 that they are not to be included in the calculations of this  subpart.
