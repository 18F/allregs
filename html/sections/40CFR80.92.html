(1) Each refiner or importer is required to have its individual baseline determination methodology, resulting baseline fuel parameter, volume and emissions values verified by an auditor which meets the requirements described in this section. A refiner or importer which has the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline is exempt from this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each refiner or importer is required to have its individual baseline determination methodology, resulting baseline fuel parameter, volume and emissions values verified by an auditor which meets the requirements described in this section.

(i) None of the auditing personnel, including any contractor or subcontractor personnel, involved in the baseline verification for a refiner or importer shall have been employed by the refiner or importer at any time during the three (3) years preceding the date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for baseline verification purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> None of the auditing personnel, including any contractor or subcontractor personnel, involved in the baseline verification for a refiner or importer shall have been employed by the refiner or importer at any time during the three (3) years preceding the date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for baseline verification purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Auditor personnel may have been a contractor or subcontractor to the refiner or importer, as long as all other criteria listed in this section are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Auditor personnel may also have developed the baseline of the refiner or importer whose baseline they are auditing, but not as an employee (per paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section). Those involved only in the development of the baseline of the refiner or importer need not meet the requirements specified in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial criteria. Neither the primary analyst, nor the auditing organization nor any organization or individual which may be contracted or subcontracted to supply baseline verification expertise shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have received more than one quarter of its revenue from the refiner or importer during the year prior to the date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for auditing purposes. Income received from the refiner or importer to develop the baseline being audited is excepted; nor</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have a total of more than 10 percent of its net worth with the refiner or importer; nor</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Receive compensation for the audit which is dependent on the outcome of the audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Technical ability. All of the following criteria must be met by the auditor in order to demonstrate its technical capability to perform the baseline audit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The auditor shall be technically capable of evaluating a baseline determination. It shall have personnel familiar with petroleum refining processes, including associated computational procedures, methods of product analysis and economics, and expertise in conducting the auditing process, including skills for effective data gathering and analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary analyst must understand all technical details of the entire baseline audit process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> The primary analyst shall have worked at least five (5) years in either refinery operations or as a consultant for the refining industry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The primary analyst shall have worked at least five (5) years in either refinery operations or as a consultant for the refining industry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If one or more computer models designed for refinery planning and/or
