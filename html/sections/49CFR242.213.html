                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person may hold certification for multiple types of conductor service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A person may hold both conductor and locomotive engineer certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A railroad that issues multiple certificates to a person, shall, to the extent possible, coordinate the expiration date of those certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a locomotive engineer, including a remote control operator, who is operating a locomotive without an assigned certified conductor must either be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certified as both a locomotive engineer under part 240 of this chapter and as a conductor under this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accompanied by a person certified as a conductor under this part but who will be attached to the crew in a manner similar to that of an independent assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Passenger railroad operations: If the conductor is removed from a train for a medical, police or other such emergency after the train departs from an initial terminal, the train may proceed to the first location where the conductor can be replaced without incurring undue delay without the locomotive engineer being a certified conductor. However, an assistant conductor or brakeman must be on the train and the locomotive engineer must be informed that there is no certified conductor on the train prior to any movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> During the duration of any certification interval, a person who holds a current conductor and/or locomotive engineer certificate from more than one railroad shall immediately notify the other certifying railroad(s) if he or she is denied conductor or locomotive engineer recertification under Sec. 242.401 or Sec. 240.219 of this chapter or has his or her conductor or locomotive engineer certification revoked under Sec. 242.407 or Sec. 240.307 of this chapter by another railroad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A person who is certified to perform multiple types of conductor service and who has had any of those certifications revoked under Sec. 242.407 may not perform any type of conductor service during the period of revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A person who holds a current conductor and locomotive engineer certificate and who has had his or her conductor certification revoked under Sec. 242.407 for a violation of Sec. 242.403(e)(1) through (5) or (e)(12) may not work as a locomotive engineer during the period of revocation. However, a person who holds a current conductor and locomotive engineer certificate and who has had his or her conductor certification revoked under Sec. 242.407 for a violation of Sec. 242.403(e)(6) through (11) may work as a locomotive engineer during the period of revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of determining the period for which a person may not work as a certified locomotive engineer due to a revocation of his or her conductor certification, only violations of Sec. 242.403(e)(1) through (5) or (e)(12) will be counted. Thus, a person who holds a current conductor and locomotive engineer certificate and who has had his or her conductor certification revoked three times in less than 36 months for two violations of Sec. 242.403(e)(6) and one violation of Sec. 242.403(e)(1) would have his or her conductor certificate revoked for 1 year, but would not be permitted to work as a locomotive engineer for one month (i.e., the period of revocation for one violation of Sec. 242.403(e)(1)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person who holds a current conductor and locomotive engineer certificate and who has had his or her locomotive engineer certification revoked under Sec. 240.307 of this chapter may not work as a conductor during the period of revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A person who has had his or her locomotive engineer certification revoked under Sec. 240.307 of this chapter may not obtain a conductor certificate pursuant to this part during the period of revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A person who had his or her conductor certification revoked under Sec. 242.407 for violations of Sec. 242.403(e)(1) through (5) or (e)(12) may not obtain a locomotive engineer certificate pursuant to part 240 of this chapter during the period of revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A railroad that denies a person conductor certification or recertification under Sec. 242.401 shall not, solely on the basis of that denial, deny or revoke that person's locomotive engineer certification or recertification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A railroad that denies a person locomotive engineer certification or recertification under Sec. 240.219 of this chapter shall not, solely on the basis of that denial, deny or revoke that person's conductor certification or recertification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> In lieu of issuing multiple certificates, a railroad may issue one certificate to a person who is certified to perform multiple types of conductor service or is certified as a conductor and a locomotive engineer. The certificate must comply with Sec. 240.223 of this chapter and Sec. 242.207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> A person who holds a current conductor and locomotive engineer certificate and who is involved in a revocable event under Sec. 242.407 or Sec. 240.307 of this chapter may only have one certificate revoked for that event. The determination by the railroad as to which certificate to revoke for the revocable event must be based on the work the person was performing at the time the event occurred.</p>
