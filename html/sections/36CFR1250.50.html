                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you have failed to pay FOIA fees in the past, we will require  you to pay your past-due bill and we may also require that you pay the  anticipated fee before we begin processing your current request. If we  estimate that your fees may be greater than $250, we may also require  advance payment or a deposit before we begin processing your request. If  you fail to make an advance payment within 60 calendar days after the  date of NARA's fee letter, we will close the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If we determine that you (acting either alone or with other  requesters) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests  in order to avoid or reduce fees, we may aggregate all of these requests  when calculating the fees. In aggregating requests, we may consider the  subject matter of the requests and whether the requests were filed close  in time to one another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, in the course of negotiating fees, you do not respond to a  NARA component within 60 calendar days, we reserve the right to  administratively close the FOIA request after 60 calendar days have  passed from the date of our last correspondence to you.</p>
