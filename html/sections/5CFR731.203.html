Where behavior covered by this part may also form the  basis for an action under parts 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter, an  agency may take the action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter,  as appropriate, instead of under this part. An agency must notify OPM to  the extent required in Sec. 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has  taken, action under these authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agencies do not need approval from OPM before taking unfavorable  suitability actions. However, they are required to report to OPM all  unfavorable suitability actions taken under this part within 30 days  after they take the action. Also, all actions based on an OPM  investigation must be reported to OPM as soon as possible and in no  event later than 90 days after receipt of the final report of  investigation.</p>
