                            <p class="depth0">A partnership, joint venture, tenants-in-common, or joint tenants  shall not be considered as a person but, notwithstanding the provisions  of Sec. 795.3, each individual or other legal entity who shares in the  proceeds derived from farming by such joint operations shall be  considered a separate person, except as otherwise provided in this part,  and shall be listed as a producer for payment purposes on program  documents. The payment shares listed on the program documents for each  individual or other legal entity shall be the same as each individual or  other legal entity shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such  joint operation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each individual or other  legal entity who shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such  joint operation shall not be considered as a separate person unless the  individual or other legal entity is actively engaged in the farming  operations of the partnership or other joint operation. An individual or  other legal entity shall be considered as actively engaged in the  farming operation only if its contribution to the joint operation is  commensurate with its share in the proceeds derived from farming by such  joint operation. Members of the partnership or joint venture must  furnish satisfactory evidence that their contributions of land, labor,  management, equipment, or capital to the joint operation are  commensurate with their claimed shares of the proceeds. A capital  contribution may be a direct out-of-pocket input of a specified sum or  an amount borrowed by the individual. If the contribution consists  substantially of capital, such capital must have been contributed  directly to the joint operation by the individual or other legal entity  and not acquired as a result of (a) a loan made to the joint operation,  (b) a loan which was made to such individual or other legal entity by  the joint operation or any of its members or related entities, or (c) a  loan made to such individual or other legal entity which was guaranteed  by the joint operation or any of its members or related entities.</p>
