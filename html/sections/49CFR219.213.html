                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disqualification. An employee who refuses to cooperate in  providing breath, blood or urine specimens following an accident or  incident specified in this subpart must be withdrawn from covered  service and must be deemed disqualified for covered service for a period  of nine (9) months in accordance with the conditions specified in  Sec. 219.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from  covered service under this section, the railroad must provide notice of  the reason for this action and an opportunity for hearing before a  presiding officer other than the charging official. The employee is  entitled to the procedural protection set out in Sec. 219.104(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject of hearing. The hearing required by this section must  determine whether the employee refused to submit to testing, having been  requested   to submit, under authority of this subpart, by a representative of the  railroad. In determining whether a disqualification is required, the  hearing official shall, as appropriate, also consider the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the railroad made a good faith determination, based on  reasonable inquiry, that the accident or incident was within the  mandatory testing requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In a case where a blood test was refused on the ground it would  be inconsistent with the employee's health, whether such refusal was  made in good faith and based on medical advice.</p>
