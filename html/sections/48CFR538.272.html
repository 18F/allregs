                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 552.238-75, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the eligible ordering activities and the offeror's customer or category of customers on which the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). If a change occurs in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship between the eligible ordering activities and this customer or category of customers, the change constitutes a ``price reduction.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Make sure that the contractor understands the requirements of section 552.238-75 and agrees to report to you all price reductions as provided for in the clause.
