                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Reagents for detection of specific novel influenza A viruses are devices that are intended for use in a nucleic acid amplification test to directly detect specific virus RNA in human respiratory specimens or viral cultures. Detection of specific virus RNA aids in the diagnosis of influenza caused by specific novel influenza A viruses in patients with clinical risk of infection with these viruses, and also aids in the presumptive laboratory identification of specific novel influenza A viruses to provide epidemiological information on influenza. These reagents include primers, probes, and specific influenza A virus controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special controls are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FDA's guidance document entitled ``Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Reagents for Detection of Specific Novel Influenza A Viruses.'' See Sec. 866.1(e) for information on obtaining this document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The distribution of these devices is limited to laboratories with experienced personnel who have training in standardized molecular testing procedures and expertise in viral diagnosis, and appropriate biosafety equipment and containment.
