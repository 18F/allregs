                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the  transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or  redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the  recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall  be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures  codified at 31 CFR part 205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain  or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the  transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund  control and accountability as established in section Sec. 518.21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to  the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the  actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in  carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing  and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively  feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for  direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any  allowable indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover  anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding  agency to the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to,  Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances  and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are  not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted  on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as  may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury  check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through  the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special  Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in  paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this  method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the  construction project is accomplished through private market financing or  Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of  the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding  agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing,  unless the billing is improper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for  reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds are not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and  the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not  feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the  Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance  basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding   agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated  disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the  awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency  shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The  working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for  recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their  subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds  available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund,  program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries  and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash  payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> or (2) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives,  the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the  United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal  Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency  may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall  not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the  conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government  is liquidated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as  depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this  section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository  accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility  requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient.  However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation  and expenditure of funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in  insured accounts whenever possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities  for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients  shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank  which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)(1)</em>, (2) or (3)  of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not  be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash  balances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The depository would require an average or minimum balance so  high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non- Federal cash resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations  do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest  bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and  Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD  20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the  recipient for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds  Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the  HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the  FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability  should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with  CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its  own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior  written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right  to recover the interest under CMIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms  shall be   authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements.  Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies  of these forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal  awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all  nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined  advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have  the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the  SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction  Programs.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for  Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF- 271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for  construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute  the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides  adequate information to meet Federal needs.</p>
