                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, there are two significant differences from the eligibility requirements under the Job Training Partnership Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the dislocated worker program in JTPA, displaced homemakers are defined as ``additional dislocated workers'' and are only eligible to receive services if the Governor determines that providing such services would not adversely affect the delivery of services to the other eligible dislocated workers. Under WIA section 101(9), displaced homemakers who meet the definition at WIA section 101(10) are eligible dislocated workers without any additional determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The definition of displaced homemaker under JTPA included individuals who had been dependent upon public assistance under Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as well as those who had been dependent on the income of another family member. The definition in WIA section 101(10) includes only those individuals who were dependent on a family member's income. Those individuals who have been dependent on public assistance may be served in the adult program.</p>
