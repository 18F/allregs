                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). The Administrator, Federal  Emergency Management Agency has determined that certain systems of  records may be exempt from the requirements of (c)(3) and (d) pursuant  to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to the extent that the system contains any  information properly classified under Executive Order 12356 or any  subsequent Executive order and which are required to be kept secret in  the interest of national defense or foreign policy. To the extent that  this occurs, such records in the following systems would be exempt:  Claims (litigation) (FEMA/GC-1)--Limited Access FEMA Enforcement (Compliance) (FEMA/GC-2)--Limited Access General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-1)--Limited Access Security Management Information System (FEMA/SEC-1)--Limited Access</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5  U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). The  Federal Emergency Management Agency will not deny individuals access to  information which has been used to deny them a right, privilege, or  benefit to which they would otherwise be entitled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exempt systems. The following systems of records, which contain  information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), shall be  exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) listed in paragraph  (b) of this section.  Claims (litigation) (FEMA/GC-1)--Limited Access FEMA Enforcement (Compliance) (FEMA/GC-2)--Limited Access General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-1)--Limited Access Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints of Discrimination Files (FEMA/ PER-2)--Limited Access</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for exemptions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1)  enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains  records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency  believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed  systems of records would impair the ability of FEMA to successfully  complete investigations and inquiries of suspected violators of civil  and criminal laws and regulations under its jurisdiction. In many cases  investigations and inquiries into violations of civil and criminal laws  and regulations involve complex and continuing patterns of behavior.  Individuals, if informed, that they have been identified as suspected  violators of civil or criminal laws and regulations, would have an  opportunity to take measures to prevent detection of illegal action so  as to avoid prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. They would  also be able to learn the nature and location of the investigation or  inquiry, the type of surveillance being utilized, and they would be able  to transmit this knowledge to co-conspirators. Finally, violators might  be given the opportunity to destroy evidence needed to prove the  violation under investigation or inquiry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable  individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal  Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these  provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair its  ability to complete or continue civil or criminal investigations and  inquiries and to detect violators of civil or criminal laws. Permitting  access to records contained in the above-listed systems of records would  provide violators with significant information concerning the nature of  the civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. Knowledge of the facts  developed during an investigation or inquiry would enable violators of  criminal and civil laws and regulations to learn the extent to which the  investigation or inquiry has progressed, and this could provide them  with an opportunity to destroy evidence that would form the basis for  prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. In addition, knowledge  gained through access to investigatory material could alert a violator  to the need to temporarily postpone commission of the violation or to  change the intended point where the violation is to be committed so as  to avoid detection or apprehension. Further, access to investigatory  material would disclose investigative techniques and procedures which,  if known, could enable violators to structure their future operations in  such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing  investigators' established and effective investigative tools and  procedures. In addition, investigatory material may contain the identity  of a confidential source of information or other informer who would not  want his/her identity to be disclosed for reasons of personal privacy or  for fear of reprisal at the hands of the individual about whom he/she  supplied information. In some cases mere disclosure of the information  provided by an informer would reveal the identity of the informer either  through the process of elimination or by virtue of the nature of the  information supplied. If informers cannot be assured that their  identities (as sources for information) will remain confidential, they  would be very reluctant in the future to provide information pertaining  to violations of criminal and civil laws and regulations, and this would  seriously compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management  Agency to carry out its mission. Further, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a  (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) to the above-listed systems of  records would make available   attorney's work product and other documents which contain evaluations,  recommendations, and discussions of on-going civil and criminal legal  proceedings; the availability of such documents could have a chilling  effect on the free flow of information and ideas within the Federal  Emergency Management Agency which is vital to the agency's predecisional  deliberative process, could seriously prejudice the agency's or the  Government's position in a civil or criminal litigation, and could  result in the disclosure of investigatory material which should not be  disclosed for the reasons stated above. It is the belief of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency that, in both civil actions and criminal  prosecutions, due process will assure that individuals have a reasonable  opportunity to learn of the existence of, and to challenge,  investigatory records and related materials which are to be used in  legal proceedings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) which  are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the  provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable  individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records  contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an  amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of  disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or  other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal  Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in  paragraphs (b)(2)(i) of this section are equally applicable to this  paragraph, and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated  herein by reference.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of  disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at  their request; such accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose  of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the  recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that  application of this provision to the above-listed systems of records  would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and  other law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and inquiries  into civil and criminal violations under their respective jurisdictions.  Making accountings available to violators would alert those individuals  to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another law  enforcement authority is conducting an investigation or inquiry into  their activities, and such accountings could reveal the geographic  location of the investigation or inquiry, the nature and purpose of the  investigation or inquiry and the nature of the information disclosed,  and the date on which that investigation or inquiry was active.  Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take  appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering  their operations, transferring their activities to other locations or  destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for  prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its  records only such information about an individual as is relevant and  necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be  accomplished by statute or executive order. The term maintain as defined  in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes ``collect'' and ``disseminate.'' At the  time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management  Agency there is often insufficient time to determine whether the  information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected  may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the  information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages  of investigation or inquiry, and in many cases information which  initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further  evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation or inquiry, prove  to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law  uncovered during a Federal Emergency Management Agency inquiry fall  within the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the Federal   Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law  enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate  information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement  agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the  information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not  be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to  violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information  comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  through the conduct of a lawful FEMAs civil or criminal investigation or  inquiry. The Federal Emergency Management Agency therefore believes that  it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed systems of records from the  provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> and (d) of 5 U.S.C.  552a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exempt systems. The following systems of records, which contain  information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), shall be  exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a listed in paragraph (c) of  this section.  Claims (litigation) (FEMA/GC-1)--Limited Access FEMA Enforcement (Compliance) (FEMA/GC-2)--Limited Access General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-2)--Limited Access Security Management Information Systems (FEMA/SEC-1)--Limited Access</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons for exemptions. All information about individuals in  these records that meet the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is  exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These  provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosure  available to the subject and access to and amendment of records. These  exemptions are claimed because the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC- 1, Security Management Information System, contains investigatory  material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability,  eligibility, or qualifications for access to classified information or  classified Federal contracts, but only to the extent that the disclosure  would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the  Government under an express promise or, prior to September 27, 1975,  under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held  in confidence. During the litigation process and investigations, it is  possible that certain records from the system of records entitled, FEMA/ SEC-1, Security Management System may be necessary and relevant to the  litigation or investigation and included in these systems of records. To  the extent that this occurs, the Administrator, FEMA, has determined  that the records would also be exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (d)  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) to protect such records. A determination  will be made at the time of the request for a record concerning whether  specific information would reveal the identity of a source. This  exemption is required in order to protect the confidentiality of the  sources of information compiled for the purpose of determining access to  classified information. This confidentiality helps maintain the  Government's continued access to information from persons who would  otherwise refuse to give it.
