                                Sec. 784.121  Exempt fisheries operations.

                            <p class="depth0">Employees engaged in the named operations, such at ``catching'' or  ``taking,'' are clearly exempt. As indicated in Sec. 784.106, employees  engaged in activities that are ``directly and necessarily a part of'' an  enumerated operation are also exempt (Mitchell v. Trade Winds, Inc., 289  F. 2d 278). The ``catching, taking, propagating, harvesting,  cultivating, or farming'' of the various forms of aquatic life includes  not only the actual performance of the activities, but also the usual  duties inherent in the occupations of those who perform the activities.  Thus, the fisherman who is engaged in ``catching'' and ``taking'' must  see to it that his lines, nets, seines, traps, and other equipment are  not fouled and are in working order. He may also have to mend or replace  his lines or nets or repair or construct his traps. Such activities are  an integral part of the operations of ``catching'' and ``taking'' of an  aquatic product.</p>
