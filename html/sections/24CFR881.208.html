Any pledge of the Agreement, Contract, or ACC, or payments  thereunder, will be limited to the amounts payable under the Contract or  ACC in accordance with its terms. If the pledge or other document  provides that all payments will be paid directly to the mortgagee or the  trustee for bondholders, the mortgagee or trustee will make all payments  or deposits required under the mortgage, trust indenture of HUD  regulations and remit any excess to the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreclosure and other transfers.
