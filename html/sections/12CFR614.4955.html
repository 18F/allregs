                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice requirement. When a System institution makes, increases, extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the System institution shall mail or deliver a written notice to the borrower and to the servicer in all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under the 1968 Act for the collateral securing the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of notice. The written notice must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A warning, in a form approved by the Administrator of FEMA, that the building or the mobile home is or will be located in a special flood hazard area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the flood insurance purchase requirements set forth in section 102(b) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement, where applicable, that flood insurance coverage is available from private insurance companies that issue standard flood insurance policies on behalf of the NFIP or directly from the NFIP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP also may be available from a private insurance company that issues policies on behalf of the company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement that the borrower is encouraged to compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and that the borrower should direct inquiries regarding the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage to an insurance agent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement whether Federal disaster relief assistance may be available in the event of damage to the building or mobile home caused by flooding in a Federally declared disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of notice. The System institution shall provide the notice required

by paragraph (a) of this section to the borrower within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction, and to the servicer as promptly as practicable after the System institution provides notice to the borrower and in any event no later than the time the System institution provides other similar notices to the servicer concerning hazard insurance and taxes. Notice to the servicer may be made electronically or may take the form of a copy of the notice to the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record of receipt. The System institution shall retain a record of the receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the period of time it owns the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternate method of notice. Instead of providing the notice to the borrower required by paragraph (a) of this section, a System institution may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or lessor that, within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale or lease transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to the purchaser or lessee. The System institution shall retain a record of the written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time it owns the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of sample form of notice. A System institution will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement for notice to the borrower of this section by providing written notice to the borrower containing the language presented in appendix A to this subpart within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice presented in appendix A to this subpart satisfies the borrower notice requirements of the 1968 Act.
