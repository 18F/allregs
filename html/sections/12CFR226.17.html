                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Form of disclosures. (1) The creditor shall make the disclosures  required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing, in a form  that the consumer may keep. The disclosures required by this subpart may  be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance  with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the  Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act)  (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). The disclosures required by Secs. 226.17(g),  226.19(b), and 226.24 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form  without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign  Act in the circumstances set forth in those sections. The disclosures  shall be grouped together, shall be segregated from everything else, and  shall not contain any information not directly related \37\ to the  disclosures required under Sec. 226.18 or Sec. 226.47.\38\ The  itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c)(1) must be  separate from the other disclosures under Sec. 226.18, except for  private education loan disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\37\ The disclosures may include an acknowledgment of receipt, the  date of the transaction, and the consumer's name, address, and account  number.</p><p class="depth0">\38\ The following disclosures may be made together with or  separately from other required disclosures: the creditor's identity  under Sec. 226.18(a), the variable rate example under  Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iv), insurance or debt cancellation under  Sec. 226.18(n), and certain security interest charges under  Sec. 226.18(o). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance  with Sec. 226.47, the terms ``finance charge'' and ``annual percentage  rate,'' when required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18 (d) and (e)  together with a corresponding amount or percentage rate, shall be more  conspicuous than any other disclosure, except the creditor's identity  under Sec. 226.18(a). For private education loan disclosures made in  compliance with Sec. 226.47, the term ``annual percentage rate,'' and  the corresponding percentage rate must be less conspicuous than the term  ``finance charge'' and corresponding amount under Sec. 226.18(d), the  interest rate under Secs. 226.47(b)(1)(i) and (c)(1), and the notice of  the right to cancel under Sec. 226.47(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and Sec. 226.20(c). For private education loan  disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47, special timing  requirements are set forth in Sec. 226.46(d). In certain transactions  involving mail or telephone orders or a series of sales, the timing of  disclosures may be delayed in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The disclosures  shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is  unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on  the best information reasonably available at the time the disclosure is  provided to the consumer, and shall state clearly that the disclosure is  an estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a transaction in which a portion of the interest is  determined on a per-diem basis and collected at consummation, any  disclosure affected by the per-diem interest shall be considered  accurate if the disclosure is based on the information known to the  creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are prepared for  consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The creditor may disregard the effects of the following in  making calculations and disclosures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That payments must be collected in whole cents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That dates of scheduled payments and advances may be changed  because the scheduled date is not a business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That months have different numbers of days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The occurrence of leap year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In making calculations and disclosures, the creditor may  disregard any   irregularity in the first period that falls within the limits described  below and any payment schedule irregularity that results from the  irregular first period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For transactions in which the term is less than 1 year, a first  period not more than 6 days shorter or 13 days longer than a regular  period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For transactions in which the term is at least 1 year and less  than 10 years, a first period not more than 11 days shorter or 21 days  longer than a regular period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For transactions in which the term is at least 10 years, a  first period shorter than or not more than 32 days longer than a regular  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If an obligation is payable on demand, the creditor shall make  the disclosures based on an assumed maturity of 1 year. If an alternate  maturity date is stated in the legal obligation between the parties, the  disclosures shall be based on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up  to a certain amount may be considered as one transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a multiple-advance loan to finance the construction of a  dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the  construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one  transaction or more than one transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If a transaction  involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be  given and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must  comply with the requirements that this regulation imposes on any or all  of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made  to any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation. If the  transaction is rescindable under Sec. 226.23, however, the disclosures  shall be made to each consumer who has the right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect of subsequent events. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate  because of an event that occurs after the creditor delivers the required  disclosures, the inaccuracy is not a violation of this regulation,  although new disclosures may be required under paragraph (f) of this  section, Sec. 226.19, Sec. 226.20, or Sec. 226.48(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Early disclosures. Except for private education loan disclosures  made in compliance with Sec. 226.47, if disclosures required by this  subpart are given before the date of consummation of a transaction and a  subsequent event makes them inaccurate, the creditor shall disclose  before consummation (subject to the provisions of Sec. 226.19(a)(2) and  Sec. 226.19(a)(5)(iii)): \39\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\39\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any changed term unless the term was based on an estimate in  accordance with Sec. 226.17(c)(2) and was labelled an estimate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All changed terms, if the annual percentage rate at the time of  consummation varies from the annual percentage rate disclosed earlier by  more than \1/8\ of 1 percentage point in a regular transaction, or more  than \1/4\ of 1 percentage point in an irregular transaction, as defined  in Sec. 226.22(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Mail or telephone orders--delay in disclosures. Except for  private education loan disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47,  if a creditor receives a purchase order or a request for an extension of  credit by mail, telephone, or facsimile machine without face-to-face or  direct telephone solicitation, the creditor may delay the disclosures  until the due date of the first payment, if the following information  for representative amounts or ranges of credit is made available in  written form or in electronic form to the consumer or to the public  before the actual purchase order or request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cash price or the principal loan amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total sale price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The finance charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The annual percentage rate, and if the rate may increase after  consummation, the following disclosures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances under which the rate may increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any limitations on the increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The effect of an increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The terms of repayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Series of sales--delay in disclosures. If a credit sale is one  of a series made under an agreement providing that subsequent sales may  be added to an outstanding balance, the creditor may   delay the required disclosures until the due date of the first payment  for the current sale, if the following two conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The consumer has approved in writing the annual percentage rate  or rates, the range of balances to which they apply, and the method of  treating any unearned finance charge on an existing balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The creditor retains no security interest in any property after  the creditor has received payments equal to the cash price and any  finance charge attributable to the sale of that property. For purposes  of this provision, in the case of items purchased on different dates,  the first purchased is deemed the first item paid for; in the case of  items purchased on the same date, the lowest priced is deemed the first  item paid for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interim student credit extensions. For transactions involving an  interim credit extension under a student credit program for which an  application is received prior to the mandatory compliance date of  Secs. 226.46, 47, and 48, the creditor need not make the following  disclosures: the finance charge under Sec. 226.18(d), the payment  schedule under Sec. 226.18(g), the total of payments under  Sec. 226.18(h), or the total sale price under Sec. 226.18(j) at the time  the credit is actually extended. The creditor must make complete  disclosures at the time the creditor and consumer agree upon the  repayment schedule for the total obligation. At that time, a new set of  disclosures must be made of all applicable items under Sec. 226.18.  [Reg. Z, 46 FR 20892, Apr. 7, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 48670, Dec. 24,  1987; 61 FR 49246, Sept. 19, 1996; 66 FR 17338, Mar. 30, 2001; 67 FR  16982, Apr. 9, 2002; 72 FR 63474, Nov. 9, 2007; 73 FR 44600, July 30,  2008; 74 FR 23301, May 19, 2009; 73 FR 44600, July 30, 2008; 74 FR  41232, Aug. 14, 2009]</p>
