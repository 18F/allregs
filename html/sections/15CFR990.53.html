                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the information on injury determination and  quantification under Sec. Sec. 990.51 and 990.52 of this part and its  relevance to restoration justify restoration, trustees may proceed with  the Restoration Planning Phase. Otherwise, trustees may not take  additional action under this part. However, trustees may recover all  reasonable assessment costs incurred up to this point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trustees must consider a reasonable range of restoration  alternatives before selecting their preferred alternative(s). Each  restoration alternative is comprised of primary and/or compensatory  restoration components that address one or more specific injury(ies)  associated with the incident. Each alternative must be designed so that,  as a package of one or more actions, the   alternative would make the environment and public whole. Only those  alternatives considered technically feasible and in accordance with  applicable laws, regulations, or permits may be considered further under  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Primary restoration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. For each alternative, trustees  must consider primary restoration actions, including a natural recovery  alternative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Natural recovery. Trustees must consider a natural recovery  alternative in which no human intervention would be taken to directly  restore injured natural resources and services to baseline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Active primary restoration actions. Trustees must consider an  alternative comprised of actions to directly restore the natural  resources and services to baseline on an accelerated time frame. When  identifying such active primary restoration actions, trustees may  consider actions that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Address conditions that would prevent or limit the effectiveness  of any restoration action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May be necessary to return the physical, chemical, and/or  biological conditions necessary to allow recovery or restoration of the  injured natural resources (e.g., replacing substrate or vegetation, or  modifying hydrologic conditions); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Return key natural resources and services, and would be an  effective approach to achieving or accelerating a return to baseline  (e.g., replacing essential species, habitats, or public services that  would facilitate the replacement of other, dependent natural resource or  service components).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compensatory restoration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. For each alternative,  trustees must also consider compensatory restoration actions to  compensate for the interim loss of natural resources and services  pending recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compensatory restoration actions. To the extent practicable,  when evaluating compensatory restoration actions, trustees must consider  compensatory restoration actions that provide services of the same type  and quality, and of comparable value as those injured. If, in the  judgment of the trustees, compensatory actions of the same type and  quality and comparable value cannot provide a reasonable range of  alternatives, trustees should identify actions that provide natural  resources and services of comparable type and quality as those provided  by the injured natural resources. Where the injured and replacement  natural resources and services are not of comparable value, the scaling  process will involve valuation of lost and replacement services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Scaling restoration actions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. After trustees have  identified the types of restoration actions that will be considered,  they must determine the scale of those actions that will make the  environment and public whole. For primary restoration actions, scaling  generally applies to actions involving replacement and/or acquisition of  equivalent of natural resources and/or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resource-to-resource and service-to-service scaling approaches.  When determining the scale of restoration actions that provide natural  resources and/or services of the same type and quality, and of  comparable value as those lost, trustees must consider the use of a  resource-to-resource or service-to-service scaling approach. Under this  approach, trustees determine the scale of restoration actions that will  provide natural resources and/or services equal in quantity to those  lost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Valuation scaling approach. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where trustees have determined  that neither resource-to-resource nor service-to-service scaling is  appropriate, trustees may use the valuation scaling approach. Under the  valuation scaling approach, trustees determine the amount of natural  resources and/or services that must be provided to produce the same  value lost to the public. Trustees must explicitly measure the value of  injured natural resources and/or services, and then determine the scale  of the restoration action necessary to produce natural resources and/or  services of equivalent value to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, in the judgment of the trustees, valuation of the lost  services is practicable, but valuation of the replacement natural  resources and/or services cannot be performed within a reasonable time  frame or at a reasonable cost, as determined by Sec. 990.27(a)(2)   of this part, trustees may estimate the dollar value of the lost  services and select the scale of the restoration action that has a cost  equivalent to the lost value. The responsible parties may request that  trustees value the natural resources and services provided by the  restoration action following the process described in Sec. 990.14(c) of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Discounting and uncertainty. When scaling a restoration action,  trustees must evaluate the uncertainties associated with the projected  consequences of the restoration action, and must discount all service  quantities and/or values to the date the demand is presented to the  responsible parties. Where feasible, trustees should use risk-adjusted  measures of losses due to injury and of gains from the restoration  action, in conjunction with a riskless discount rate representing the  consumer rate of time preference. If the streams of losses and gains  cannot be adequately adjusted for risks, then trustees may use a  discount rate that incorporates a suitable risk adjustment to the  riskless rate.
