                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Funding duly elected resident councils and jurisdiction wide  resident councils. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HA shall provide funds it receives for this  purpose to the duly elected resident council at each development and/or  those jurisdiction-wide councils eligible to receive the resident  portion of the tenant services account to use for resident participation  activities. This shall be an addition to the Performance Funding System  (PFS), as provided by 24 CFR part 990, to permit HAs to fund $25 per  unit per year for units represented by duly elected resident councils  for resident services, subject to the availability of appropriations. Of  this amount, $15 per unit per year would be provided to fund tenant  participation activities under subpart B of this part for duly elected  resident councils and/or jurisdiction-wide councils and $10 per unit per  year would be used by the HA to pay for costs incurred in carrying out  tenant participation activities under subpart B of this part, including  the expenses for conducting elections, recalls or arbitration required  under Sec. 964.130 in subpart B. This will guarantee the resources  necessary to create a bona fide partnership among the duly elected  resident councils, the HA and HUD. Where both local and jurisdiction- wide councils exist, the distribution will be   agreed upon by the HA and the respective councils.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If funds are available through appropriations, the HA must  provide tenant services funding to the duly elected resident councils  regardless of the HA's financial status. The resident council funds  shall not be impacted or restricted by the HA financial status and all  said funds must be used for the purpose set forth in subparts B and C of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The HA and the duly elected resident council at each development  and/or those jurisdiction-wide councils shall collaborate on how the  funds will be distributed for tenant participation activities. If  disputes regarding funding decisions arise between the parties, the  matter shall be referred to the Field Office for intervention. HUD Field  Office shall require the parties to undertake further negotiations to  resolve the dispute. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from  the date of the Field Office intervention, the Field Office shall refer  the matter to HUD Headquarters for final resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stipends. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD encourages HAs to provide stipends to resident  council officers who serve as volunteers in their public housing  developments. The amount of the stipend, up to $200 per month/per  officer, shall be decided locally by the resident council and the HA.  Subject to appropriations, the stipends will be funded from the resident  council's portion of the operating subsidy funding for resident council  expenses ($15.00 per unit per year).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 913.106, stipends are not to be construed as  salaries and should not be included as income for calculation of rents,  and are not subject to conflict of interest requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funding provided by a HA to a duly elected resident council may  be made only under a written agreement between the HA and a resident  council, which includes a resident council budget and assurance that all  resident council expenditures will not contravene provisions of law and  will promote serviceability, efficiency, economy and stability in the  operation of the local development. The agreement must require the local  resident council to account to the HA for the use of the funds and  permit the HA to inspect and audit the resident council's financial  records related to the agreement.</p>
