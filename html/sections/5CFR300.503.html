                            <p class="depth0">An agency may enter into a contract or other procurement arrangement  with a temporary help service firm for the brief or intermittent use of  the skills of private sector temporaries, when required, and may call  for those services, subject to these conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> One of the following short-term situations exists--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee is absent for a temporary period because of a  personal need including emergency, accident, illness, parental or family  responsibilities, or mandatory jury service, but not including vacations  or other circumstances which are not shown to be   compelling in the judgment of the agency, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agency must carry out work for a temporary period which  cannot be delayed in the judgment of the agency because of a critical  need.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The need cannot be met with current employees or through the  direct appointment of temporary employees within the time available by  the date, and for the duration of time, help is needed. At minimum, this  should include an agency determination that there are no qualified  candidates on the applicant supply file and on the reemployment priority  list (both of which must provide preference for veterans), and no  qualified disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected  disability of 30 percent or more under 5 U.S.C. 3112, who are  immediately available for temporary appointment of the duration  required, and that employees cannot be reassigned or detailed without  causing undue delay in their regular work. In instances where a need is  foreseeable, as when approval of employee absence is requested well in  advance, an agency may have sufficient time to follow the temporary  appointment recruiting requirements, including veterans' preference  found in 5 CFR part 316 to determine whether qualified candidates are  available by the date needed and for the length of service required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> These services shall not be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of the regular recruitment and hiring procedures under  the civil service laws for permanent appointment in the competitive  civil service, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To displace a Federal employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To circumvent controls on employment levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In lieu of appointing a surplus or displaced Federal employee as  required by 5 CFR part 330, subpart F (Agency Career Transition  Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees) and subpart G (Interagency  Career Transition Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees.)
