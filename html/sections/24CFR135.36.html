In housing and community development programs, priority consideration shall be given, where feasible, to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 3 business concerns that provide economic opportunities for section 3 residents in the service area or neighborhood in which the section 3 covered project is located (category 1 businesses); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applicants (as this term is defined in 42 U.S.C. 12899) selected to carry out HUD Youthbuild programs (category 2 businesses);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other section 3 business concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility for preference.

perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed contract. (The ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed contract is required of all contractors and subcontractors subject to the procurement standards of 24 CFR 85.36 (see 24 CFR 85.36(b)(8)).) This regulation requires consideration of, among other factors, the potential contractor's record in complying with public policy requirements. Section 3 compliance is a matter properly considered as part of this determination.</p>
