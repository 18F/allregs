                                Sec. 1.1374-8  Section 1374(d)(8) transactions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If any S corporation acquires any asset in a  transaction in which the S corporation's basis in the asset is  determined (in whole or in part) by reference to a C corporation's basis  in the assets (or any other property) (a section 1374(d)(8)  transaction), section 1374 applies to the net recognized built-in gain  attributable to the assets acquired in any section 1374(d)(8)  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date of section 1374(d)(8). Section 1374(d)(8) applies  to any section 1374(d)(8) transaction, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section, that occurs on or after December 27, 1994, without regard  to the date of the corporation's election to be an S corporation under  section 1362.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Separate determination of tax. For purposes of the tax imposed  under section 1374(d)(8), a separate determination of tax is made with  respect to the assets the S corporation acquires in one section  1374(d)(8) transaction from the assets the S corporation acquires in  another section 1374(d)(8) transaction and from the assets the  corporation held when it became an S corporation. Thus, an S  corporation's section   1374 attributes when it became an S corporation may only be used to  reduce the section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S  corporation held at that time. Similarly, an S corporation's section  1374 attributes acquired in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be  used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the  S corporation acquired in the same transaction. If an S corporation  makes QSub elections under section 1361(b)(3) for a tiered group of  subsidiaries effective on the same day, see Sec. 1.1361-4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Taxable income limitation. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section, an S corporation's taxable income limitation under Sec.  1.1374-2(a)(2) for any taxable year is allocated between or among each  of the S corporation's separate determinations of net recognized built- in gain for that year (determined without regard to the taxable income  limitation) based on the ratio of each of those determinations to the  sum of all of those determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X is a C corporation  that elected to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1986  (before section 1374 was amended in the Tax Reform Act of 1986). X has a  net operating loss carryforward of $20,000 arising in 1985 when X was a  C corporation. On January 1, 1996, Y (an unrelated C corporation) merges  into X in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies. Y has no  loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets X  acquired from Y are subject to tax under section 1374 and have a net  unrealized built-in gain of $150,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $50,000 on  dispositions of assets acquired from Y and a taxable income limitation  of $100,000 (because only one group of assets is subject to section  1374, there is no allocation of the taxable income limitation). As a  result, X has a net recognized built-in gain on those assets of $50,000.  X's $20,000 net operating loss carryforward may not be used as a  deduction against its $50,000 net recognized built-in gain on the assets  X acquired from Y. Therefore, X has a section 1374 tax of $17,500  ($50,000 x .35 = $17,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate) for its 1996  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Y is a C  corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1,  1996. The assets Y holds when it becomes an S corporation have a net  unrealized built-in gain of $5,000. Y has no loss carryforwards,  credits, or credit carryforwards. On January 1, 1997, Z (an unrelated C  corporation) merges into Y in a transaction to which section  368(a)(1)(A) applies. Z has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit  carryforwards. The assets Y acquired from Z are subject to tax under  section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $80,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1997, Y has a pre-limitation amount on the assets it held  when it became an S corporation of $15,000, a pre-limitation amount on  the assets Y acquired from Z of $15,000, and a taxable income limitation  of $10,000. However, because the assets Y held on becoming an S  corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000, its net  recognized built-in gain on those assets is limited to $5,000 before  taking into account the taxable income limitation. Y's taxable income  limitation of $10,000 is allocated between the assets Y held on becoming  an S corporation and the assets Y acquired from Z for purposes of  determining the net recognized built-in gain from each pool of assets.  Thus, Y's net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y held on becoming  an S corporation is $2,500 [$10,000 x ($5,000/$20,000) = $2,500]. Y's  net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y acquired from Z is $7,500  [$10,000 x ($15,000/$20,000) = $7,500]. Therefore, Y has a section 1374  tax of $3,500 [($2,500 + $7,500) x .35 = $3,500, assuming a 35 percent  tax rate] for its 1997 taxable year.
