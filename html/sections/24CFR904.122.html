Introduction--a. The Home. The Home described in Part I of this Agreement is part of a Development, which the Authority has acquired or caused to be constructed. This Development contains a number of dwelling units including related land, and may also include common areas and property as described in Part I for occupancy by low-income families under lease-purchase agreements, each in the form of this Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement. This Development is financed by sale of the Authority's notes which will be amortized over the period of years specified in the Annual Contributions Contract relating to this Development.</p><p class="depth0">b. Annual Contributions Contract. The Authority has entered into an Annual Contributions Contract (``ACC'') with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD'') under which the Authority will receive Annual Contributions provided by HUD, and will perform certain operational functions, to provide housing for the Homebuyers and assist the Homebuyers in achieving homeownership.</p><p class="depth0">c. Management. The Authority may enter into a contract or contracts for management of the Development or for performance of management functions, by the Homebuyers Association (see section 5) or others.</p><p class="depth0">d. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``Authority'' means the local housing authority which acquires or develops a low-rent housing development with financial assistance from HUD, owns the Homes until title is transferred to the Homebuyers, and is responsible for the management of the homeownership opportunity program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``common property'' means the nondwelling structures and equipment, common areas, community facilities, and in some cases certain component parts of dwelling structures, which are contained in the Development: Provided, however, That in the case of a Development that is organized as a condominium or a planned unit development (PUD), the term ``common property'' shall have the meaning established by the condominium or PUD documents and the State law pursuant to which the condominium or PUD is organized, under the terms, ``common areas,'' ``common facilities,'' ``common elements,'' ``common estate,'' or other similar terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term ``Development'' means the entire undertaking including all real and personal property, funds and reserves, rights, interests and obligations, and activities related thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term ``EHPA'' means the Earned Home Payments Account established and maintained pursuant to section 10 of the Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The term ``Homebuyer'' means the member or members of a low-income family who have executed a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement with the Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The term ``Homebuyers Association'' (HBA) means an organization as defined in section 5 of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The term ``Homeowner'' means a Homebuyer who has acquired title to his Home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The term ``Homeowners Association'' means an association comprised of Homeowners, including condominium associations, having responsibilities with respect to common property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The term ``HUD'' means the Department of Housing and Urban Development which provides the Authority with financial assistance through loans and annual contributions and technical assistance in development and operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The term ``NRMR'' means the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve established and maintained pursuant to section 11 of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The term ``Project'' is used to refer to the Development in relation to matters specifically related to the Annual Contributions Contract.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement. Under this Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, the Homebuyer may achieve ownership of the home described in Part I by making the required monthly payments and providing maintenance and repairs to build up a credit in his Earned Home Payments Account (hereinafter called ``EHPA''). While the Homebuyer

is performing his obligations, the purchase price will be reduced in accordance with the Purchase Price Schedule, so that, while this purchase price is being reduced, the Homebuyer is increasing the amount of his EHPA. The Homebuyer may also make voluntary payments to his EHPA which will enable him to acquire ownership more quickly. The Homebuyer may take title to his Home when he is able to finance or pay in full the balance of the purchase price as shown on the Purchase Price Schedule plus the costs incidental to acquiring ownership, as provided in section 16 or 17, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Status of Homebuyer. Until the Homebuyer satisfies the conditions set forth in section 10d precedent to the exercise of his option to purchase the Home for the applicable purchase price, the Homebuyer shall have the status of a lessee of the Authority from month to month with an obligation to build up such balance in his EHPA within the first two years of his occupancy and to continue adding to his EHPA thereafter. For convenience the term ``Homebuyer'' also refers to the occupant during his status as a lessee.</p><p class="depth0">4. Counseling of Homebuyers. The Authority shall provide training and counseling, as required and approved by HUD. The Authority's own staff and resources, existing community resources, a private agency under contract with the Authority, or any combination of the three, shall be utilized to prepare Homebuyers for the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of homeownership including participation in the Homebuyers Association.

Homebuyers Association.\2\ Upon the signing of this Agreement, the Homebuyer's family automatically becomes a member of the Homebuyers Association having membership and purposes as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of said Association. In the absence of a duly organized Homebuyers Association, the Authority shall be free to act without the HBA action required by this Agreement.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ There may be cases, such as where the homes are on scattered sites, where there is no Homebuyers Association but an alternative method for homebuyer representation and counseling is provided (see 24 CFR 904.307). In such cases, section 5 and other portions of this Agreement referring to the Homebuyers Association should be modified to reflect the alternative method provided for homebuyer representation and counseling.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6. Routine maintenance, repair and use of premises. a. Routine maintenance. The Homebuyer shall be responsible for the routine maintenance of his dwelling and grounds, to the satisfaction of the Homebuyers Association and the Authority. This routine maintenance includes the work (labor and materials) of keeping the dwelling structure, grounds and equipment in good repair, condition and appearance so that they may be utilized continually at their designed capacities and at the satisfactory level of efficiency for their intended purposes, and in conformity with the requirements of local housing codes and applicable regulations and guidelines of HUD. It includes repairs (labor and materials) to the dwelling structure, plumbing fixtures, dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), shades and screens, water heaters, heating equipment and other component parts of the dwelling. It also includes all interior painting and maintenance of the grounds (lot) on which the dwelling is located. It does not include maintenance and replacements provided for by the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve described in Section 11.</p><p class="depth0">b. Repair of damage. In addition to his obligation for routine maintenance, the Homebuyer shall be responsible for repair of any damage caused by the Homebuyer, members of his family, or visitors.</p><p class="depth0">c. Care of Home. The Homebuyer agrees to keep his dwelling in a sanitary condition; to cooperate with the Authority and the Homebuyers Association in keeping and maintaining the common area and property, including fixtures and equipment, in good condition and appearance; and to follow all rules of the Authority and of the Homebuyers Association concerning the use and care of the dwellings and the common areas and property.</p><p class="depth0">d. Inspections. The Homebuyer agrees to permit officials, employees, or agents of the Authority, and of the Homebuyers Association to inspect his Home at reasonable hours and intervals in accordance with rules established by the Authority and the Homebuyers Association.</p><p class="depth0">e. Use of Home. The Homebuyer shall not (1) sublet his Home without the prior written approval of the Authority and HUD, (2) use or occupy his home for any unlawful purpose nor for any purpose deemed hazardous by insurance companies on account of fire and other risks, or (3) provide accommodations (unless approved by the Homebuyers Association and the Authority) to boarders or lodgers. The Homebuyer agrees to use the Home only as a place to live for himself and his family (as identified in his initial application or by subsequent amendment with the approval of the Authority), for children thereafter born to or adopted by members of such family, and for aged or widowed parents of the Homebuyer or spouse who may join the household.</p><p class="depth0">f. Obligations with respect to other persons and property. Neither the Homebuyer nor any member of his family shall interfere with rights of other occupants of the Development, or damage the common property or

the property of others, or create physical hazards.</p><p class="depth0">g. Structural changes. A Homebuyer shall not make any structural changes in or additions to his Home unless the Authority has first determined in writing that such change would not (1) impair the value of the unit, the surrounding units, or the Development as a whole, or (2) affect the use of the Home for residential purposes, or (3) violate HUD requirements as to construction and design. Any changes made in accordance with this paragraph shall be at the Homebuyer's expense, and in the event of termination of this Agreement before the Homebuyer acquires title to the Home, whether by reason of the Homebuyer's default or otherwise, the Homebuyer shall not be entitled to any compensation on account of his having made such changes.</p><p class="depth0">h. Statement of condition and repair. When the Homebuyer moves in, the Authority shall inspect the Home and shall give the Homebuyer a written statement, to be signed by the Authority and the Homebuyer, of the condition of the Home and the equipment in it. Should the Homebuyer vacate, the Authority shall inspect the Home and give the Homebuyer a written statement of the repairs and other work, if any, required to put the Home in good condition for the next occupant (see section 10k). The Homebuyer or his representative, or both, may join in any such inspections with the Authority and the Homebuyer Association.</p><p class="depth0">7. Monthly payments by Homebuyer--a. Determination of amount. Except as otherwise provided hereinafter, the Homebuyer agrees to pay to the Authority, so long as this Agreement is in effect, a required Monthly Payment as lease rental in an amount determined in accordance with a schedule adopted by the Authority and approved by HUD. Although the total monthly housing cost consists of the sum of the break-even amount (see section 8) and the debt service (payment of principal and interest) on the applicable share of the capital cost of the Development, the Homebuyer, so long as he qualifies as low income, is not required to pay the full amount, but is assisted by HUD annual contributions. The schedule shall provide for payments to be based upon a percentage of the family's adjusted monthly income and shall indicate allowances for those utilities which the Homebuyer will pay for directly.</p><p class="depth0">b. Changes in monthly payment due to changes in family income or other circumstances. The required Monthly Payment may be adjusted as a result of the Authority's regularly or specially scheduled reexamination of the Homebuyer's family income and family composition. Interim changes may be made in accordance with the Authority's policy on reexaminations, or under unusual circumstances, at the request of the Homebuyer, if both the Authority and the Homebuyers Association agree that such action is warranted.</p><p class="depth0">c. Changes in monthly payment due to changes in rent schedules. The required Monthly Payment may also be adjusted by changes in the required percentage of income to reflect (1) changes in operating expense as described in section 9b and (2) changes in utility allowances.</p><p class="depth0">d. Acceptance of monthly payment. The Authority shall not refuse to accept monthly payments because of any other charges (i.e., other than overdue monthly payments) owed by the Homebuyer to the Authority; however, by accepting monthly payments under such circumstances the Authority shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies with respect to such other charges.</p><p class="depth0">e. Application of monthly payment. The Homebuyer's Monthly Payment shall be applied by the Authority as follows: First, to the credit of the Homebuyer's EHPA pursuant to section 10 below; second, to the credit of the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve for the Home pursuant to Section 11 below; and third, for payment of Monthly Operating Expense, including contribution to Operating Reserve, as provided in section 9 below.</p><p class="depth0">8. Break-even amount--a. Definition. The term ``Break-even Amount'' means the minimum monthly amount needed to provide funds for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monthly Operating Expense, including provision for a contribution to Operating Reserve, pursuant to section 9a below;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The monthly amount to be credited to the Homebuyer's EHPA pursuant to Section 10 below; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The monthly amount to be credited to the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve for the Home pursuant to section 11 below.</p><p class="depth0">b. Monthly payment in excess of break-even amount. When the Homebuyer's required Monthly Payment exceeds the applicable Break-even Amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income.</p><p class="depth0">c. Monthly payment below break-even amount. When the Homebuyer's required Monthly Payment is less than the applicable Break-even Amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the Monthly Payment designated for Operating Expense (i.e., as a reduction of project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the Break-even Amount for these accounts.</p><p class="depth0">9. Monthly operating expense--a. Definition and categories of monthly operating expense. The term ``monthly operating expense'' means the monthly amount needed for the following purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Administration. Administrative salaries, travel, legal expenses, office supplies, postage, telephone and telegraph, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Homebuyer services. Authority expenses in the achievement of social goals, including costs such as salaries, publications, payments to the HBA to assist its operation, contract and other costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Utilities. Those utilities (such as water), if any to be furnished by the Authority as part of operating expense;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Routine maintenance--Common property. For community building, grounds, and other common areas, if any. The amount required for routine maintenance of common property depends upon the type of common property included in the Development and the extent of the Authority's responsibility for maintenance (see also section 9c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Protective services. The cost of supplemental protective services paid by the Authority for the protection of persons and property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> General expense. Premiums for fire and other insurance, payments in lieu of taxes to the local taxing body, collection losses, payroll taxes, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Nonroutine maintenance--Common property (contribution to operating reserve). Extraordinary maintenance of equipment applicable to the community building and grounds, and unanticipated items for non-dwelling structures (see section 12).</p><p class="depth0">b. Monthly operating expense rate. The monthly operating expense rate for each fiscal year shall be established on the basis of the Authority's HUD-approved operating budget for that fiscal year. The operating budget may be revised during the course of the fiscal year in accordance with HUD requirements. If it is subsequently determined that the actual operating expense for a fiscal year was more or less than the amount provided by the monthly operating expense established for that fiscal year, the rate of monthly operating expense to be established for the next fiscal year may be adjusted to account for the difference (see section 12). Such adjustment may result in a change in the required monthly payment (see section 7c).</p><p class="depth0">c. Provision for common property maintenance. During the period the Authority is responsible for the maintenance of common property, the annual operating budget and the monthly operating expense rate shall include the amount required for routine maintenance of all common property in the Development, even though a number of the homes may have been acquired by homebuyers. During such period, this amount shall be computed on the basis of the total number of homes in the Development (i.e., the annual amount budgeted for routine maintenance of common property shall be divided by the number of Homes in the Development, resulting in the annual amount for each Home; this figure shall in turn be divided by 12 to determine the monthly amount to be included in the monthly operating expense (and in the break-even amount) for routine maintenance of common property). After the Homeowners Association assumes responsibility for maintenance of common property, the monthly operating expense (and break-even amount) shall include an amount equal to the monthly assessment by the homeowners association for the remaining homes owned by the Authority (see section 11 for nonroutine maintenance of common property).</p><p class="depth0">d. Posting of monthly operating expense statement. A statement showing the budgeted monthly amount allocated in the current operating budget to each operating expense category shall be provided to the HBA and a copy shall be provided to the Homebuyer upon request.</p><p class="depth0">10. Earned Home Payments Account (EHPA)--a. Credits to the account. The Authority shall establish and maintain a separate EHPA for each Homebuyer. Since the Homebuyer is responsible for maintaining his Home as provided in section 6, a portion of his required Monthly Payment equal to the Authority's estimate, approved by HUD, of the monthly cost for such routine maintenance, taking into consideration the relative type and size of the Home, shall be set aside in his EHPA. In addition, this account shall also be credited with (1) any voluntary payments made pursuant to section 10g and (2) any amount earned through the performance of maintenance pursuant to paragraph e of this section. All amounts received by the Authority for credit to the Homebuyer's account, including credits for performance of maintenance pursuant to paragraph e of this section, shall be held by the Authority for the account of the Homebuyer.</p><p class="depth0">b. Use of EHPA funds. The unused balance in the Homebuyer's EHPA may be used toward purchase of the Home as provided in section 16 or 17 as applicable, or shall be payable to the Homebuyer if he leaves the Project as provided in paragraph k of this section.</p><p class="depth0">c. Charges to the account. (1) If for any reason the Homebuyer is unable or fails to perform any item of required maintenance as described in section 6, the Authority shall arrange to have the work done in accordance with the procedures established by the Authority and the HBA and the cost thereof shall be charged to the Homebuyer's EHPA. Inspections of the Home shall be made jointly by the Authority and the HBA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the extent nonroutine maintenance expense is made necessary by the negligence of the Homebuyer as determined by the HBA and the Authority (see section 11), the cost thereof shall be charged to the EHPA.</p><p class="depth0">d. Exercise of option; required amount in EHPA. The Homebuyer may exercise his option to buy the Home, by paying the applicable purchase price pursuant to section 16 or 17, only after satisfying the following conditions precedent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within the first two years of his occupancy, he has achieved a balance in his EHPA equal to 20 times the amount of the monthly EHPA credit as initially determined in accordance with paragraph a of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> He has met, and is continuing to meet, the requirements of this Agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> He has rendered, and is continuing to render, satisfactory performance of his responsibilities to the HBA.</p><p class="depth0">When the Homebuyer has met these conditions precedent, the Authority shall give the Homebuyer a certificate to that effect. After achieving the required minimum EHPA balance within the first two years of his occupancy, the Homebuyer shall continue to be obligated to provide the required maintenance, thereby continuing to add to his EHPA. If the Homebuyer fails to meet either his obligation to achieve the minimum EHPA balance as specified or his obligation thereafter to continue adding to the EHPA, the Authority and the HBA shall investigate and take appropriate corrective action, including termination of this Agreement by the Authority in accordance with section 24.</p><p class="depth0">e. Additional equity through other maintenance. Besides the maintenance which the Homebuyer must provide pursuant to section 6, the Homebuyer may earn additional EHPA credits by providing in whole or in part any of the maintenance necessary to the common property of the Development or maintenance for which the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve is established (see section 11). Such maintenance may be provided by the Homebuyer and credit earned therefor only pursuant to a prior written agreement between the Homebuyer and the Authority (or the Homeowners Association, depending on who has responsibility for maintenance of the property involved), covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the Homebuyer is to receive. Upon completion of such work, the agreed amount shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and credited to the Homebuyer's EHPA.</p><p class="depth0">f. Investment of excess. When the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the Authority shall notify the HBA and shall invest the excess in federally-insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD and in accordance with any recommendations made by the HBA. If the HBA wishes to participate in the investment program it should submit periodically to the Authority a list of HUD approved securities, bonds, or obligations which the HBA reecommends for investment by the Authority of the funds in the EHPAs. Interest earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each Homebuyer's EHPA in proportion to the amount in each such reserve account.</p><p class="depth0">Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the Authority shall prepare a statement showing: (1) the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances; (2) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs, and (3) the aggregate uninvested balance of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs. This statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</p><p class="depth0">g. Voluntary payments. To enable the Homebuyer to acquire title to the Home within a shorter period, he may either periodically or in a lump sum voluntarily make payments over and above his required monthly payments. Such voluntary payments shall be deposited to his credit in his EHPA.</p><p class="depth0">h. Delinquent monthly payments. Under exceptional circumstances as determined by the HBA and the Authority, the Homebuyer's EHPA may be used to pay his delinquent required monthly payments, provided the amount used for this purpose does not seriously deplete the account and provided that the Homebuyer agrees to cooperate in such counseling as may be made available by the Authority or the HBA.</p><p class="depth0">i. Annual statement to homebuyer. The Authority shall provide an annual statement to the Homebuyer specifying at least (1) the amount in his EHPA, and (2) the amount in his Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the Authority which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve, shall be accounted for through a work order. The Homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his Home.</p><p class="depth0">j. Withdrawal and assignment. The Homebuyer shall have no right to assign, withdraw, or in any way dispose of the funds in his EHPA except as provided in this section or in sections 16 and 17.</p><p class="depth0">k. Application of EHPA upon vacating of dwelling. (1) In the event this Agreement is terminated or if the Homebuyer vacates the Home, the Authority shall charge against the Homebuyer's EHPA the amounts required to pay; (i) The amount due the Authority, including the monthly payments the Homebuyer is obligated to pay up to the date he vacates; (ii) the monthly payment for the period the Home is vacant, not to exceed 30 days from the date of notice of intention to vacate, or if the Homebuyer failed to give notice of intention to vacate, 30 days from the date the Home is put in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6; and (iii) the cost of any routine

maintenance, and of any nonroutine maintenance attributable to the negligence of the Homebuyer, required to put the Home in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Homebuyer's EHPA balance is not sufficient to cover all of these charges, the Authority shall require the Homebuyer to pay the additional amount due. If the amount in the EHPA exceeds these charges, the excess shall be paid the Homebuyer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Settlement with the Homebuyer shall be made promptly after the actual cost of repairs to the dwelling has been determined (see paragraph k(1)(iii) of this section), provided that the Authority shall make every effort to make such settlement within 30 days from the date the Homebuyer vacates. The Homebuyer may obtain a settlement within 7 days of the date he vacates, even though the actual cost of such repairs has not yet been determined, if he has given the Authority notice of intention to vacate 30 days prior to the date he vacates and if the amount to be charged against his EHPA for such repairs is based on the Authority's estimate of the cost thereof (determined after consultation with the appropriate representative of the HBA).</p><p class="depth0">11. Nonroutine maintenance reserve (NRMR)--a. Purpose of reserve. The Authority shall establish and maintain a separate nonroutine maintenance reserve (NRMR) for the Home, using a portion of the Homebuyer's monthly payment. The purpose of the NRMR is to provide funds for the nonroutine maintenance of the Home, which consists of the infrequent and costly items of maintenance and replacement shown on the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule for the Home (see paragraph b of this section). Such maintenance may include the replacement of dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), replacement of roof, exterior painting, major repairs to heating and plumbing systems, etc. The NRMR shall not be used for nonroutine maintenance of common property, or for nonroutine maintenance relating to the Home to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the Homebuyer's negligence or to defective materials or workmanship.</p><p class="depth0">b. Amount of reserve. The amount of the monthly payments to be set aside for NRMR shall be determined by the Authority, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule showing the amount estimated to be needed for nonroutine maintenance of the Home during the term of this Agreement, taking into consideration the type of construction and dwelling equipment. This Schedule shall (1) list each item of nonroutine maintenance (e.g., range, refrigerator, plumbing, heating system, roofing, tile flooring, exterior painting, etc.), (2) show for each listed item the estimated frequency of maintenance or useful life before replacement, the estimated cost of maintenance or replacement (including installation) for each occasion, and the annual reserve requirement, and (3) show the total reserve requirements for all the listed items, on an annual and a monthly basis. This Schedule shall be prepared by the Authority and approved by HUD as part of the Submission required to determine the financial feasibility of the Project. The Schedule shall be revised after approval of the working drawings and specifications, and shall thereafter be reexamined annually in the light of changing economic conditions and experience.</p><p class="depth0">c. Charges to reserve. (1) The Authority shall provide the nonroutine maintenance necessary for the Home and the cost thereof shall be funded as provided in paragraph c(2) and c(3) of this section. Such maintenance may be provided by the Homebuyer but only pursuant to a prior written agreement with the Authority covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the Homebuyer is to receive. The amount of any credit shall, upon completion of the work, be credited to the Homebuyer's EHPA and charged as provided in paragraph c(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost of nonroutine maintenance shall be charged to the NRMR for the Home except that (i) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the fault or negligence of the Homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the Homebuyer's EHPA after consultation with the HBA if the Homebuyer disagrees, and (ii) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, or even though covered by warranty if not paid for through no fault or negligence of the Homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense account of the Project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the event the amount charged against the NRMR exceeds the balance therein, the difference (deficit) shall be made up from continuing monthly credits to the NRMR based upon the Homebuyer's monthly payments. If there is still a deficit when the Homebuyer acquires title, the Homebuyer shall pay such deficit at settlement.</p><p class="depth0">d. Transfer of NRMR. (1) In the event this Agreement is terminated, the Homebuyer shall not receive any balance or be required to pay any deficit in the NRMR. When a subsequent Homebuyer moves in, the NRMR shall continue to be applicable to the Home in the same amount as if the preceding Homebuyer had continued in occupancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event the Homebuyer purchases the Home, and there remains a balance in the NRMR, the Authority shall pay such balance to the Homebuyer at settlement. In the event the Homebuyer purchases the Home and there is a deficit in the NRMR, the

Homebuyer shall pay such deficit to the Authority at settlement.</p><p class="depth0">e. Investment of excess. (1) When the aggregate amount of the NRMR balances for all the Homes exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the Authority shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD. Income earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each Homebuyer's NRMR in proportion to the amount in each reserve account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periodically, but not less often that semi-annually, the Authority shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all NRMR balances, (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of the NRMR and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of the NRMRs. A copy of this statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</p><p class="depth0">12. Operating reserve--a. Purpose of reserve. To the extent that total operating receipts (including subsidies for operations) exceeds total operating expenditures of the Project, the LHA shall establish an operating reserve up to the maximum approved by HUD in connection with its approval of the annual operating budgets for the Project. The purpose of this reserve is to provide funds for (1) the infrequent but costly items of nonroutine maintenance and replacements of common property, taking into consideration the types of items which constitute common property, such as nondwelling structures and equipment, and, in certain cases, common elements of dwelling structures, (2) nonroutine maintenance for the Homes to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, (3) working capital for payment of a deficit in a Homebuyer's NRMR, until such deficit is offset by future monthly payments by the Homebuyer or at settlement in the event the Homebuyer should purchase, and (4) a deficit in the operation of the Project for a fiscal year, including a deficit resulting from monthly payments totaling less than the break-even amount for the Project.</p><p class="depth0">b. Nonroutine maintenance--_____ common property (contribution to operating reserve). The amount under this heading to be included in operating expense (and in the break-even amount) established for the fiscal year (see sections 8 and 9) shall be determined by the Authority, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of estimates of the monthly amount needed to accumulate an adequate reserve for the items described in paragraph a(1) of this section. This amount shall be subject to revision in the light of experience. This contribution to the Operating Reserve shall be made only during the period the Authority is responsible for the maintenance of any common property; and during such period, the amount shall be determined on the basis of the requirements of all common property in the Development in a manner similar to that explained in Section 9. When the Operating Reserve reaches the maximum authorized in paragraph c of this Section, the break-even (monthly operating expense) computations (see Sections 8 and 9) for the next and succeeding fiscal years need not include a provision for this contribution to the Operating Reserve unless the balance of the Reserve is reduced below the maximum during any such succeeding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">c. Maximum operating reserve. The maximum operating reserve that may be retained by the Authority at the end of any fiscal year shall be the sum of (1) one-half of total routine expense included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year and (2) one-third of total break-even amounts included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year; provided that such maximum may be increased if necessary as determined or approved by HUD. Total routine expense means the sum of the amounts budgeted for administration, homebuyer services. Authority-supplied utilities, routine maintenance of common property, protective services, and general expense or other category of day-to-day routine expense (see section 9 above for explanation of various categories of expense).</p><p class="depth0">d. Transfer to Homeowners Association. The Authority shall be responsible for and shall retain custody of the Operating Reserve until the Homeowners acquire voting control of the Homeowners Association (see sections 21c and 22f). When the Homeowners acquire voting control, the Homeowners Association shall then assume full responsibility for management and maintenance of common property under a plan approved by HUD, and there shall be transferred to the Homeowners Association a portion of the Operating Reserve then held by the Authority, as determined by the Authority with the approval of HUD.</p><p class="depth0">e. Disposition of reserve. If, at the end of a fiscal year, there is an excess over the maximum Operating Reserve, this excess shall be applied to the operating deficit of the Project, if any, and any remainder shall be paid to HUD. Following the end of the fiscal year in which the last Home has been conveyed by the Authority, the balance of the Operating Reserve held by the Authority shall be paid to HUD, provided that the aggregate amount of payments by the Authority under this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by HUD with respect to the Project.</p><p class="depth0">13. Annual statement and copies of work orders to homebuyer. a. The Authority shall maintain books of accounts and provide a statement at least annually to each Homebuyer which will show (i) the amount in his

EHPA, and (2) the amount in the NRMR for his Home.</p><p class="depth0">b. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the Authority, which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the NRMR shall be accounted for through a work order. The Homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his Home.</p><p class="depth0">14. Insurance. a. Until transfer of title to the Homebuyer, the Authority shall carry all insurance prescribed by HUD including fire and extended coverage insurance upon the Home in such form and amount and with such company or companies as it determines. The Authority shall not carry any insurance on the Homebuyer's furniture, clothing, automobile, or any other personal property, or personal liability insurance covering the Homebuyer.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the event the Home is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, the Authority shall consult with the Homebuyer as to whether the Home shall be repaired or rebuilt. If the Authority determines that the Home should not be repaired or rebuilt but the Homebuyer disagrees, the matter shall be submitted to HUD for final determination. If the final determination is that the Home should not be repaired or rebuilt, the Authority shall terminate this Agreement upon reasonable notice to the Homebuyer. In such case, the Homebuyer shall be paid the balance in his EHPA and (to assist him in connection with relocation expenses) the balance in his NRMR, less amounts, if any, due from him to the Authority, including Monthly Payments he may be obligated to pay.</p><p class="depth0">c. In the event of termination or if the Home must be vacated during the repair period, the Authority will use its best efforts to assist in relocating the Homebuyer. If the Home must be vacated during the repair period, Monthly Payments shall be suspended during the vacancy period.</p><p class="depth0">15. Eligibility for continued occupancy. a. The Homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the Authority determines the Homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the Homebuyer's total payment equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph b of this section). In such an event, if the Authority determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the Authority shall notify the Homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the Home; or (2) move from the Development. If, however, the Authority determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent a monthly payment consistent with its adjusted monthly income, in accordance with applicable HUD regulations prescribing rental payments for families in housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.</p><p class="depth0">b. The term ``monthly housing cost,'' as used in this section means the sum of: (1) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the Homebuyer can purchase the Home by the method described in section 16 below); (2) one-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the Homebuyer will be required to pay as a Homeowner; (3) one-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the Authority with respect to the Home; (4) the current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA) and routine maintenance-common property; and (5) the current Authority and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the Homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the Authority.</p><p class="depth0">16. Achievement of ownership by initial homebuyer--a. Determination of initial purchase price. The Authority shall determine the initial purchase prices of the Homes by two basic steps, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1. The Authority shall take the Estimated Total Development Cost (including the full amount for contingencies as authorized by HUD) of the Development as shown in the Development Cost Budget in effect upon award of the Main Construction Contract or execution of the Contract of Sale, and shall deduct therefrom the amounts, if any, attributed to (1) relocation costs, (2) counseling and training costs, and (3) the cost of any community, administration or management facilities including the land, equipment and furnishings attributable to such facilities as set forth in the development program for the Development.</p><p class="depth0">The resulting amount is herein called Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2. The Authority shall apportion the Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers among all the Homes in the Development. This apportionment shall be made by obtaining an FHA appraisal of each Home, and adjusting such appraised values (upward or downward) by the percentage difference between the total of the appraisal for all the Homes and the Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers. The adjusted amount for each Home shall be the Initial Purchase Price for that Home.</p><p class="depth0">b. Purchase Price Schedule. The Homebuyer shall be provided with a Purchase Price Schedule showing (1) the monthly declining

purchase price over a 30-year period, \3\ commencing with the initial purchase price on the first day of the month following the effective date of this Agreement and (2) the monthly debt service amount upon which the Schedule is based. This Schedule and debt service amount shall be computed on the basis of the initial purchase price, a 30-year period, \3\ and a rate of interest equal to the minimum loan interest rate as specified in the Annual Contributions Contract for the Project on the date of HUD approval of the Development Cost Budget, described in paragraph a of this section, rounded up, if necessary, to the next multiple of one-fourth of one percent (\1/4\ percent).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Change to 25-year period where appropriate pursuant to Sec. 904.101(b)(3) of this subpart.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. Methods of Purchase. (1) The Homebuyer may achieve ownership when the amount in his EHPA, plus such portion of the NRMR as he wishes to use for the purchase, is equal to the purchase price as shown at that time on his Purchase Price Schedule plus all Incidental Costs (``Incidental Costs'' means the costs incidental to acquiring ownership, including, but not limited to, the costs for a credit report, field survey title examination, title insurance, and inspections, the fees for attorneys other than the LHA's attorney, mortgage application and organization, closing and recording, and the transfer taxes and loan discount payment if any). If for any reason title to the Home is not conveyed to the Homebuyer during the month in which such circumstances occur, the purchase price shall be fixed at the amount specified for such month and the Homebuyer shall be refunded (i) the net additions, if any, credited to his EHPA subsequent to such month, and (ii) such part of the monthly payments made by the Homebuyer after the purchase price has been fixed which exceeds the sum of the break-even amount attributable to the Home and the interest portion of the debt service shown in the Purchase Price Schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the sum of the purchase price and Incidental Costs is greater than the amounts in the Homebuyer's EHPA and NRMR, the Homebuyer may achieve ownership by obtaining financing for or otherwise paying the excess amount. The purchase price shall be the amount shown on his Purchase Price Schedule for the month in which the settlement date for the purchase occurs.</p><p class="depth0">d. The maximum period for achieving ownership shall be 30 years, but depending upon increases in the Homebuyer's income and the amount of credit which the Homebuyer can accumulate through maintenance and voluntary payments, the period may be shortened accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">17. Achievement of Ownership by Subsequent Homebuyer--a. Definition. In the event the initial Homebuyer and his family vacate the Home before having acquired ownership, a subsequent occupant who enters into a Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement and who is not a successor pursuant to section 25 is herein called ``Subsequent Homebuyer.''</p><p class="depth0">b. Determination of Initial Purchase Price. The initial purchase price for a subsequent Homebuyer shall be an amount equal to (1) the purchase price shown in the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule as of the date of this Agreement with the subsequent Homebuyer plus (2) the amount, if any, by which the appraised fair market value of the Home determined or approved by HUD as of the same date, exceeds the purchase price specified in (1). In the event such appraised value has not been determined by the date of execution of this Agreement, the amount of the Initial Purchase Price shall be inserted in part I, section D after this determination has been made, with appropriate initialling or signing by the parties.</p><p class="depth0">c. Purchase Price Schedule. The Subsequent Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be the same as the unexpired portion of the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule except that where his purchase price includes an additional amount as specified in paragraph b(2) of this section, the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be followed by an Additional Purchase Price Schedule for such additional amount based upon the same monthly debt service and the same interest rate as applied to the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule.</p><p class="depth0">18. Transfer of Title to Homebuyer. When the Homebuyer is to obtain ownership, a closing date shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. On the closing date, the Homebuyer shall pay the required amount of money to the Authority, sign the promissory note pursuant to section 19, and receive a deed for the Home.</p><p class="depth0">19. Payment Upon Resale at Profit--a. Promissory Note. (1) When a Homebuyer (whether Initial or Subsequent Homebuyer) achieves ownership, he shall sign a note obligating him to make a payment to the Authority, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the event he resells his Home at a profit within 5 years of actual residence in the Home after he becomes a Homeowner. If, however, the Homeowner should purchase and occupy another Home within one year (18 months in case of a newly constructed home) of the resale of the Turnkey III Home, the Authority shall refund to the Homeowner the amount previously paid by him under the note, less the amount, if any, by which the resale price of the Turnkey III Home exceeds the acquisition price of the new home, provided that application for such refund shall be made no later than 30 days after the date of acquisition of the new home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The note to be signed by the Homebuyer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be secured by a second mortgage. The initial amount of the note shall be computed by taking the appraised value of the Home at the time the Homebuyer becomes a Homeowner and subtracting (i) the Homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs and (ii) the increase in value of the Home, determined by appraisal, caused by improvements paid for by the Homebuyer with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR. The note shall provide that this initial amount shall be automatically reduced by 20 percent thereof at the end of each year of residency as Homeowner, with the note terminating at the end of the five-year period of residency, as determined by the Authority. To protect the Homeowner, the note shall provide that the amount payable under it shall in no event be more than the net profit on the resale, that is, the amount by which the resale price exceeds the sum of (i) the Homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs, (ii) the costs of the resale, including commissions and mortgage prepayment penalties, if any, and (iii) the increase in value of the Home, determined by appraisal, resulting from improvements paid for by him as a Homebuyer (with funds other than from the EHPA or NRMR) or as a Homeowner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Residency requirements. The five-year note periods does not end if the Homeowner rents or otherwise does not use the Home as his principal place of residence for any period within the first five years after he achieves ownership. Only the actual amount of time he is in residence is counted and the note shall be in effect until a total of five years time of residence has elapsed, at which time the Homeowner may request the Authority to release him from the note, and the Authority shall do so.</p><p class="depth0">20. Responsibilities of Homeowner. After acquisition of ownership, the Homeowner shall pay to the Authority or to the Homeowners Association, as appropriate, a monthly fee for (a) the maintenance and operation of community facilities including utility facilities, if any, (b) the maintenance of grounds and other common areas, and (c) such other purpose as determined by the Authority or the Homeowners Association, as appropriate, including taxes and a provision for a reserve.</p><p class="depth0">21.

The common areas, sidewalks, parking lots and other common property in the Development shall be owned and maintained as provided for in the approved planned unit development (PUD) program, except that the Authority shall be responsible for maintenance until such time as the Homeowners Association assumes such responsibility (see section 12 above).</p><p class="depth0">b. The title ultimately conveyed to the Homebuyer shall be subject to restrictions and encumbrances to protect the rights and property of all other Homeowners. The Homeowners Association shall have the right and obligation to enforce such restrictions and encumbrances and to assess Homeowners for the costs incurred in connection with common areas and property and other responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0">c. There shall be as many votes in the Association as there are Homes in the Development, and at the outset all the voting rights will be held by the Authority. As each Home is conveyed to a Homebuyer, one vote shall automatically go to that Homebuyer so that when all the Homes have been conveyed, the Authority shall no longer have any interest in the Homeowners Association.</p><p class="depth0">d. The Authority shall not lose its majority voting interest in the Association as soon as a majority of the Homes have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time or the Authority so desires. If permitted by state law, provisions shall be made for each Home owned by the Authority to carry three votes while each Home owned by a Homeowner shall carry one vote. Under this weighted voting plan, the Authority will continue to have voting control until 75 percent of the Homes have been acquired by Homeowners. However, at its discretion, the Authority may transfer voting control to the Homeowners when at least 50 percent of the Homes have been acquired by the Homeowners.</p><p class="depth0">22.

If this Home is in a Planned Unit Development, delete section 22. If this Home is in Condominium, delete section 21.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. The Authority at the outset shall own each condominium unit and the undivided interest of such unit in the common areas.</p><p class="depth0">b. All the land, including that land under the housing units, shall be a part of the common areas.</p><p class="depth0">c. The Homeowners Association shall own no property and shall merely maintain and operate the common areas for the individual owners of the condominium units, except that the Authority shall be responsible for

maintenance until such time as the Homeowners Association assumes such responsibility (see section 12 above).</p><p class="depth0">d. The percentage of undivided interest attached to each condominium unit shall be based on the ratio of the value of the unit to the value of all units and shall be fixed when the Development is completed. This percentage shall determine the Homeowner's liability for the maintenance of the common areas and facilities.</p><p class="depth0">e. Each Homeowner vote in the Homeowners Association will be identical with the percentage of undivided interest attached to his unit.</p><p class="depth0">f. The Authority shall not lose its majority voting interest in the Association as soon as units representing more than 50 percent of the value of all units have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time or the Authority so desires. For voting purposes, until units representing 75 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by Homeowners, the total undivided interest attributable to the Homes owned by the Authority shall be multiplied by three, if such weighted voting plan is permitted by state law. Under this plan, the Authority will continue to have voting control until units representing 75 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by Homeowners. However, at its discretion the Authority may transfer voting control to the Homeowners when units representing at least 50 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by the Homeowners.</p><p class="depth0">23. Relationship of Homeowners Association to Homebuyers Association. The Homebuyers Association and the Authority may make arrangements with the Homeowners Association to permit Homebuyers to participate in Homeowners Association matters which affect the Homebuyers. Such arrangements may include rights to attend meetings and to participate in Homeowners Association deliberations and decisions.</p><p class="depth0">24. Termination of Agreement--a. Termination by the Authority--(1) In the event the Homebuyer should breach this Agreement by failure to make a required Monthly Payment within 10 days after its due date, by misrepresentation or withholding of information in applying for admission or in connection with any subsequent reexamination of income and family composition, or by failure to comply with any other Homebuyer obligation under this Agreement, the Authority may terminate this Agreement 30 days after giving the Homebuyer notice of its intention to do so in accordance with paragraph (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of termination by the Authority shall be in writing. Such notice shall state (i) the reason for termination, (ii) that the Homebuyer may respond to the Authority, in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable period of time regarding the reason for termination, (iii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice, including a representative of the HBA, (iv) that the Authority will consult the HBA concerning the termination, and (v) that, unless the Authority rescinds or modifies the notice, the termination will be effective at the end of the 30-day notice period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Termination by the Homebuyer. The Homebuyer may terminate this Agreement by giving the Authority 30 days notice in writing of his intention to terminate and to vacate the Home. In the event that the Homebuyer vacates the Home without notice to the Authority, this Agreement shall be terminated automatically and the Authority may dispose of, in any manner deemed suitable by it, any items of personal property left by the Homebuyer in the Home.</p><p class="depth0">c. Transfer to rental unit. (1) Inasmuch as the Homebuyer was found eligible for admission to the Project on the basis of having the necessary elements, of potential for Homeownership, continuation of eligibility requires continuation of this potential, subject only to temporary unforeseen changes in circumstances. The standards of potential for Homeownership are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income sufficient to result in a required monthly payment which is not less than the sum of the amounts necessary to pay the EHPA, the NRMR, and the estimated average monthly cost of utilities attributable to the Home;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ability to meet all the obligations of a Homebuyer under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least one member gainfully employed, or having an established source of continuing income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accordingly, in the event it should develop that the Homebuyer no longer meets one or more of these elements of Homeownership potential, the Authority shall investigate the circumstances and provide such counseling and assistance as may be feasible in order to help the family overcome the deficiency as promptly as possible. After a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the investigation, the Authority shall make a re-evaluation as to whether the family has regained the potential for Homeownership or is likely to do so within a further reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the re-evaluation. Further extension of time may be granted in exceptional cases, but in any event a final determination shall be made no later than 90 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the initial investigation. The Authority shall invite the HBA to participate in all investigations and evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the final determination of the Authority, after considering the views of the

HBA, is that the Homebuyer should be transferred to a suitable dwelling unit in an Authority rental project, the Authority shall give the Homebuyer written notice of the Authority determination of the loss of Homeownership potential and of the offer of transfer to a rental unit. The notice shall state that the transfer shall occur as soon as a suitable rental unit is available for occupancy but no earlier than 30 days from the date of the notice, provided that an eligible successor for the Homebuyer unit has been selected by the Authority. The notice shall also state that if the Homebuyer should refuse to move under such circumstances, the family may be required to vacate the Homebuyer unit, without further notice. The notice shall include a statement (i) that the Homebuyer may respond to the Authority in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable time, regarding the reason for the determination and offer of transfer, (ii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice including a representative of the HBA, and (iii) that the Authority has consulted the HBA concerning this determination and offer of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph 24c, the amount in the Homebuyer's EHPA shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 10k of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">25. Survivorship. (1) In the event of death, mental incapacity or abandonment of the family by the Homebuyer, the person designated as the successor in part I of this Agreement shall succeed to the rights and responsibilities under the Agreement if that person is an occupant of the Home at the time of the event and is determined by the Authority to meet all of the standards of potential for homeownership as set forth in section 24a. This designation may be changed by the Homebuyer at any time. If there is no such designation or the designee is no longer an occupant of the Home or does not meet the standards of potential for homeownership, the Authority may consider as the Homebuyer any family member who was in occupancy at the time of the event and who meets the standards of potential for homeownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If there is no qualified successor in accordance with the above, the Authority shall terminate the Agreement and another family shall be selected, except under the following circumstances: where a minor child or children of the Homebuyer family are in occupancy, then in order to protect their continued occupancy and opportunity for acquisition of ownership of the Home, the Authority may approve as occupants of the unit, an appropriate adult(s) who has been appointed legal guardian of the children with a duty to perform the obligations of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement in their interest and behalf.</p><p class="depth0">26. Nonassignability and Use of Reserves and Accounts--a. Nonassignability. The Homebuyer shall not assign this Agreement, or assign, mortgage or pledge any right or interest in the Home or in this Agreement including any right or interest in any reserve or account, except with the prior written approval of the Authority and HUD.</p><p class="depth0">b. Use of Reserves and Accounts. It is understood and agreed that the Homebuyer shall have no right to receive or use the money in any reserve or account created pursuant to this Agreement except for the limited purposes and under the special circumstances set forth by the terms of this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that both the Authority and HUD have a financial and a governmental interest in the Earned Home Payments Account and other reserves as security for the financial integrity of the Development, as a means of savings in cost to the Government by minimizing the amount and period over which HUD annual contributions must be paid, and as a means of advancing the public interest and welfare by assisting low-income families to achieve homeownership.</p><p class="depth0">27. Notices. Any notice required hereunder or by law shall be sufficient if delivered in writing to the Homebuyer personally or to an adult member of his family residing in the dwelling unit or if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, properly addressed to the Homebuyer, postage prepaid. Notice to the Authority shall be in writing, and either delivered to any Authority employee at the office of the Authority or sent to the Authority by certified mail, properly addressed, postage prepaid.</p><p class="depth0">28. Grievance Procedure. All grievances or appeals arising under this Agreement shall be processed and resolved pursuant to the grievance procedure of the Authority, which procedure shall provide for participation of the HBA in the grievance process. This grievance procedure shall be posted in the Authority's Office.
