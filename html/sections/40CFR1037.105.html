                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards of this section apply for the following vehicles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR and at or below 26,000 pounds GVWR, but not certified to the vehicle standards Sec.  1037.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicles above 26,000 pounds GVWR that are not tractors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vocational tractors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR that are excluded from the standards in Sec.  1037.104 under Sec.  1037.104 (f) or use engines certified under Sec.  1037.150(m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The CO2 standards of this section are given in Table 1 to this section. The provisions of Sec.  1037.241 specify how to comply with these standards.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec.   1037.105--CO2 Standards for Vocational Vehicles------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">CO2 standard</p><p class="depth2"><em>(g/ton-mile)</em>    CO2 standard</p><p class="depth2">GVWR (pounds)                  for model     (g/ton-mile)</p><p class="depth2">years 2014-   for model year</p><p class="depth2">2016       2017 and later------------------------------------------------------------------------GVWR <=19,500...........................             388             37319,500 4 or N2O standards apply under this section.

This requires that you specify a Family Emission Limit (FEL) for CO2 for each vehicle subfamily. The FEL may not be less than the result of emission modeling from Sec.  1037.520. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the vehicle subfamily instead of the standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Your vehicles must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section throughout their full useful life, expressed in service miles or calendar years, whichever comes first.

If you include smaller vehicles in a credit-generating subfamily (with an FEL below the standard), exclude its production volume from the credit calculation.</p>
