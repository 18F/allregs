the costs of the materials, or the transportation of mineral materials from outside the HCNRA presents a safety hazard. When mineral materials are obtained from inside the HCNRA, the environmental effects at the source of extraction must be mitigated by site reclamation upon the termination of the extraction activity. Site reclamation may include contouring the land, re-establishing vegetation, and other measures deemed appropriate by the authorized officer to blend the site into the surrounding environment to the extent practicable. The HCNRA shall not be the source of mineral materials for use outside the HCNRA for projects that do not directly benefit the HCNRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wilderness Lands and Wild and Scenic Rivers.
