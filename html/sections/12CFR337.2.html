                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. As used in this section, the term standby letter of  credit means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement however named  or described, which represents an obligation to the beneficiary on the  part of the issuer: (1) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for  the account of the account party, or (2) to make payment on account of  any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, or (3) to make payment  on account of any default (including any statement of default) by the  account party in the performance of an obligation. \1\ The term similar  arrangement includes the creation of an acceptance or similar  undertaking. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ As defined in this paragraph (a), the term standby letter of  credit would not include commercial letters of credit and similar  instruments where the issuing bank expects the beneficiary to draw upon  the issuer, which do not ``guaranty'' payment of a money obligation of  the account party and which do not provide that payment is occasioned by  default on the part of the account party. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restriction. A standby letter of credit issued by an insured  State nonmember bank shall be combined with all other standby letters of  credit and all loans for purposes of applying any legal limitation on  loans of the bank (including limitations on loans to any one borrower,  on loans to affiliates of the bank, or on aggregate loans); Provided,  however, That if such standby letter of credit is subject to separate  limitation under applicable State or federal law, then the separate  limitation shall apply in lieu of the loan limitation. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Where the standby letter of credit is subject to a non-recourse  participation agreement with another bank or other banks, this section  shall apply to the issuer and each participant in the same manner as in  the case of a participated loan. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. All standby letters of credit shall be subject to  the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section except where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank is paid an  amount equal to the bank's maximum liability under the standby letter of  credit; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank has set  aside sufficient funds in a segregated deposit account, clearly  earmarked for that purpose, to cover the bank's maximum liability under  the standby letter of credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure. Each insured State nonmember bank must maintain  adequate control and subsidiary records of its standby letters of credit  comparable to the records maintained in connection with the bank's  direct loans so that at all times the bank's potential liability  thereunder and the bank's compliance with this section may be readily  determined. In addition, all   such standby letters of credit must be adequately reflected on the  bank's published financial statements.</p>
