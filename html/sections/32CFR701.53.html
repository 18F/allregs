                            <p class="depth0">The following fee schedule shall be used to compute the search, review (in the case of commercial requesters) and duplication costs associated with processing a given FOIA request. The appropriate fee category of the requester shall be applied before computing fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manual search.

Fee assessments for computer search consist of two parts; individual time (hereafter referred to as human time) and machine time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Human time. Human time is all the time spent by humans performing the necessary tasks to prepare the job for a machine to execute the run command. If execution of a run requires monitoring by a human, that human time may be also assessed as computer search. The terms ``programmer/operator'' shall not be limited to the traditional programmers or operators. Rather, the terms shall be interpreted in their broadest sense to incorporate any human involved in performing the computer job (e.g. technician, administrative support, operator, programmer, database administrator, or action officer).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Machine time. Machine time involves only direct costs of the central processing unit (CPU), input/output devices, and memory capacity used in the actual computer configuration. Only this CPU rate shall be charged. No other machine-related costs shall be charged. In situations where the capability does not exist to calculate CPU time, no machine costs can be passed on to the requester. When CPU calculations are not available, only human time costs shall be assessed to requesters. Should DON activities lease computers, the services charged by the lessor shall not be passed to the requester under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duplication.

Search costs are computed as for any other record. Duplication cost is the

actual direct cost of reproducing the material, including the wage of the person doing the work. Audiovisual materials provided to a requester need not be in reproducible format or quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other records. Direct search and duplication cost for any record not described in this section shall be computed in the manner described for audiovisual documentary material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Costs for special services. Complying with requests for special services is at the discretion of the DON activity. Neither the FOIA nor its fee structure cover these kinds of services. Therefore, DON activities may recover the costs of special services requested by the requester after agreement has been obtained in writing from the requester to pay for such fees as certifying that records are true copies, sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc.</p>
