The FCA shall send a copy of this certification to the creditor agency and a copy to the employee. If the FCA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it shall provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount).</p>
