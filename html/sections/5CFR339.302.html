                            <p class="depth0">An agency may, at its option, offer a medical examination (including a psychiatric evaluation) in any situation where the agency needs additional medical documentation to make an informed management decision. This may include situations where an individual requests for medical reasons a change in duty status, assignment, working conditions, or any other benefit or special treatment (including reasonable accommodation or reemployment on the basis of full or partial recovery from a medical condition) or where the individual has a performance or conduct problem which may require agency action. Reasons for offering an examination must be documented. An offer of an examination shall be carried out and used in accordance with 29 CFR 1613.706.</p>
