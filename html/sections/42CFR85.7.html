                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to beginning an investigation, NIOSH officers shall  present their credentials to the owner, operator, or agent in charge at  the place of employment, explain the nature, purpose, and scope of the  investigation and the records specified in Sec.  85.5 which they wish to  review. Where the investigation is the result of a request submitted by  an authorized representative of employees, a copy of the request shall  be provided to the employer, except where the requester or any person  authorizing the requester pursuant to Sec.  85.3-1(e)(2) has indicated  that NIOSH not reveal his name to the employer, in which case a summary  of the basis for the request shall be provided to the employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the commencement of an investigation, the employer should  precisely identify information which can be obtained in the workplace or  workplaces to be inspected as trade secrets. If the NIOSH officer has no  clear reason to question such identification, such information shall not  be disclosed except in accordance with the provisions of section  20(a)(6) and section 15 of the OSH Act or section 501(a)(11) of the FMSH  Act. However, if NIOSH at any time questions such identification by an  employer, not less than 15 days' notice to an employer shall be given of  the intention to remove the trade secret designation from such  information. The employer may within that period submit a request to the  Director, NIOSH, to reconsider this intention and may provide additional  information in support of the trade secret designation. The Director,  NIOSH, shall notify the employer in writing of the decision which will  become effective no sooner than 15 days after the date of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NIOSH officers are authorized to collect environmental samples  and samples of substances or measurements of physical agents (including  measurement of employee exposure by the attachment of personal sampling  devices to employees with their consent), to take or obtain photographs  related to the purpose of the investigation, employ other reasonable  investigative techniques, including medical examinations of employees  with the consent of such employees, and to question privately any  employer, owner, operator, agent, or employee. The employer shall have  the opportunity to review photographs taken or obtained for the purpose  of identifying those which contain or might reveal a trade secret.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NIOSH officers shall comply with all safety and health rules and  practices at the place of employment being investigated, and they shall  provide and use appropriate protective clothing and equipment. In  situations requiring specialized or unique types of protective  equipment, such equipment shall be furnished by the employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The conduct of investigations shall be such as to preclude  unreasonable disruption of the operations of the employer's  establishment.
