The testing of each individual unit will complete the cycle specified in Table 3 until the breathing supply of the initial test unit is exhausted. This initial test unit will then be replaced by a second unit, which will continue the test cycle, beginning at the work rate in the cycle at which the initial unit was exhausted, and completing the full period specified in Table 3 for that work rate before proceeding to the subsequent work rate, if any, specified in Table 3. Each initial testing unit will be replaced as many times as necessary to complete the cycle, not to exceed two replacement units per initial test unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The performance test will begin with two exhalations into the unit at the specified ventilation rate and then follow the manufacturer's instructions to determine the design's susceptibility to hypoxia upon initial donning.</p><p class="depth2">Table 3--Performance Test Requirements----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Duration</p><p class="depth2">per cycle                  VCO2 (L/                RF (breaths/</p><p class="depth2">Work-rate test sequence                  (in      VO2 (L/min)      min)      Ve (L/min)      min)</p><p class="depth2">minutes)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
