                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 21a, 51, 51a, 51b, 51b-1, 52, 56, 57, 59,  60, and 93a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing requirements. A national bank shall submit an  application and obtain OCC approval to decrease its permanent capital.  Generally, a national bank need only submit a notice to increase its  permanent capital, although, in certain circumstances, a national bank  shall be required to submit an application and obtain OCC approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section describes procedures and standards relating  to a transaction resulting in a change in a national bank's permanent  capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Sections 5.8,  5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to changes in a national bank's permanent  capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Capital plan means a plan describing the manner and schedule by  which a national bank will attain specified capital levels or ratios and  a capital   restoration plan filed with the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR  6.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capital stock means the total amount of common stock and  preferred stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Capital surplus means the total of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount paid in on capital stock in excess of the par or  stated value;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct capital contributions representing the amounts paid in  to the national bank other than for capital stock;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount transferred from undivided profits; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount transferred from undivided profits reflecting stock  dividends.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Permanent capital means the sum of capital stock and capital  surplus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Policy. In determining whether to approve a proposed change to a  national bank's permanent capital, the OCC considers whether the change  is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with law, regulation, and OCC policy thereunder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides an adequate capital structure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If appropriate, complies with the bank's capital plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Increases in permanent capital--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior approval--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Criteria. A national bank need not obtain prior OCC approval to increase  its permanent capital unless the bank is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Required to receive OCC approval pursuant to letter, order,  directive, written agreement or otherwise;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Selling common or preferred stock for consideration other than  cash; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Receiving a material noncash contribution to capital surplus.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application and notice. A national bank that proposes to  increase its permanent capital and that must receive OCC approval under  paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section shall file an application under  paragraph (i)(1) of this section and a notice under paragraph (i)(3) of  this section. A national bank not required to obtain prior approval  under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section for an increase in capital  shall file only the notice under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preferred stock. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this  section, in the case of a sale of preferred stock, the national bank  shall also submit provisions in the articles of association concerning  preferred stock dividends, voting and conversion rights, retirement of  the stock, and rights to exercise control over management to the  appropriate district office prior to the sale of the preferred stock.  The provisions will be deemed approved by the OCC within 15 days of its  receipt, unless the OCC notifies the applicant otherwise, including a  statement of the reason for the delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decreases in permanent capital. A national bank shall submit an  application and obtain prior approval under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2)  of this section for any reduction of its permanent capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior approval. A national bank proposing to  make a change in its permanent capital that requires prior OCC approval  under paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section shall submit an application  to the appropriate district office. The application must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describe the type and amount of the proposed change in permanent  capital and explain the reason for the change;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a reduction in capital, provide a schedule  detailing the present and proposed capital structure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a material noncash contribution to capital,  provide a description of the method of valuing the contribution; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State if the bank is subject to a capital plan with the OCC and  how the proposed change would conform to a capital plan or if a capital  plan is otherwise required in connection with the proposed change in  permanent capital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. A bank seeking to  decrease its capital may request OCC approval for up to four consecutive  quarters. An eligible bank may decrease its capital pursuant to such a  plan only if the bank maintains its eligible bank status   before and after each decrease in its capital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice. After a bank completes an increase in capital it shall  submit a notice to the appropriate district office. The proposed change  is deemed approved by the OCC and certified seven days after the date on  which the OCC receives the notice. The notice must be acknowledged  before a notary public by the bank's president, vice president, or  cashier and contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount, including the par value of the stock, and effective  date of the increase;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A certification that the funds have been paid in, if  applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A certified copy of the amendment to the articles of  association, if required; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A statement that the bank has complied with all laws,  regulations and conditions imposed by the OCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice process. A national bank that decreases its capital in  accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section shall notify  the appropriate district office following the completion of the  transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expiration of approval. Approval expires if a national bank has  not completed its change in permanent capital within one year of the  date of approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Offers and sales of stock. A national bank shall comply with the  Securities Offering Disclosure Rules in 12 CFR part 16 for offers and  sales of common and preferred stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Shareholder approval. A national bank shall obtain the necessary  shareholder approval required by statute for any change in its permanent  capital.
