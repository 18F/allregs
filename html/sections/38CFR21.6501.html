                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The temporary program for trial work periods and vocational rehabilitation is intended to test the extent to which a veteran, who has

been awarded a VA compensation rating of total disability by reason of inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability, may benefit from vocational rehabilitation services which may be authorized under 33 U.S.C. chapter 31, and 38 U.S.C. 1163. See Sec. Sec. 3.340 and 3.341 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Chapter 31 evaluations. All veterans participating in this temporary program are to be evaluated to determine whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are eligible for and entitled to receive assistance under chapter 31; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1163; Pub. L. 100-687).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability of chapter 31 provisions. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 21.1 through 21.430, generally applicable to veterans eligible for benefits under chapter 31, apply except as added to or modified by the provisions of the following sections. Participants not found eligible for chapter 31 benefits may nevertheless receive counseling services under 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(2) and placement and postplacement services under 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(5).
