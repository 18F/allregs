                                Sec. 40.409  What does the issuance of a PIE mean to transportation employers?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As an employer, you are deemed to have notice of the issuance of a PIE when it appears on the List mentioned in Sec. 40.401(a) or the notice of the PIE appears in the Federal Register as provided in Sec. 40.401(d). You should check this List to ensure that any service agents you are using or planning to use are not subject to a PIE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As an employer who is using a service agent concerning whom a PIE is issued, you must stop using the services of the service agent no later than 90 days after the Department has published the decision in the Federal Register or posted it on its web site. You may apply to the ODAPC Director for an extension of 30 days if you demonstrate that you cannot find a substitute service agent within 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except during the period provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not, as an employer, use the services of a service agent that are covered by a PIE that the Director has issued under this subpart. If you do so, you are in violation of the Department's regulations and subject to applicable DOT agency sanctions (e.g., civil penalties, withholding of Federal financial assistance).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You also must not obtain drug or alcohol testing services through a contractor or affiliate of the service agent to whom the PIE applies.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (d): Service Agent R was subject to a PIE with respect to SAP services. As an employer, not only must you not use R's own SAP services, but you also must not use SAP services you arrange through R, such as services provided by a subcontractor or affiliate of R or a person or organization that receives financial gain from its relationship with R.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This section's prohibition on using the services of a service agent concerning which the Director has issued a PIE applies to employers in all industries subject to DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (e): The initiating official for a PIE was the FAA drug and alcohol program manager, and the conduct forming the basis of the PIE pertained to the aviation industry. As a motor carrier, transit authority, pipeline, railroad, or maritime employer, you are also prohibited from using the services of the service agent involved in connection with the DOT drug and alcohol testing program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The issuance of a PIE does not result in the cancellation of drug or alcohol tests conducted using the service agent involved before the issuance of the Director's decision or up to 90 days following its publication in the Federal Register or posting on the Department's web site, unless otherwise specified in the Director's PIE decision or the Director grants an extension as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (f): The Department issues a PIE concerning Service Agent N on September 1. All tests conducted using N's services before September 1, and through November 30, are valid for all purposes under DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations, assuming they meet all other regulatory requirements.</p>
