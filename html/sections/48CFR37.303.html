Any of the property that is more  useful to the Government than its value as salvage to the contractor  should be expressly designated in the contract for retention by the  Government. The contracting officer shall determine the fair market  value of any property not so designated, since the contractor will get  title to this property, and its value will therefore be important in  determining what payment, if any, shall be made to the contractor and  whether additional compensation will be made if the contract is  terminated.</p>
