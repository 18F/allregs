                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The purpose of a borrower's occupancy rules is to  outline the basis for the tenant and management relationship. Prior to  Agency approval of occupancy rules, borrowers must provide written  certification from their attorney that the housing project's occupancy  rules are consistent with applicable Federal, state, and local laws, as  well as Agency requirements, and the requirements of all programs  participating in the housing project. Borrowers must obtain Agency  approval of the occupancy rules prior to initial occupancy and obtain  Agency approval prior to the implementation date of any subsequent  modifications to the rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. The occupancy rules must be in writing and posted  for easy tenant access. A copy of these rules must be attached to the  tenant's lease upon initial occupancy. At a minimum, the occupancy rules  must address:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tenant's rights and responsibilities under the lease or  occupancy agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rent payment or occupancy charge policies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The policies regarding periodic inspection of units;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The system for responding to tenant complaints;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The maintenance request and work order procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The housing services and facilities available to tenants or  members;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The office locations, hours, and emergency telephone numbers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The restrictions on storage and prohibitions on non-functional  vehicles in the housing project area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other requirements related to a subsidy provided to a tenant  from non-Agency sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> When a guest becomes a member of the tenant household; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The procedures tenants must follow to request reasonable  accommodations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Modification of occupancy rules. The Agency must concur with any  modification to the occupancy rules prior to implementation. Proper  notice must be given to each tenant at least 30 days in advance of  implementation of such rules in accordance with Sec. 3560.160.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal, state and local requirements. The occupancy rules must  be consistent with Federal, state, and local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pets/Assistance Animals. All housing projects should establish  reasonable written pet rules. No rules may be promulgated that would  prevent occupancy by a household member who requires a service or  assistance animal. In elderly housing, borrowers must not prohibit  tenants from keeping domestic animals in their rental units as pets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tenant organizations. Borrowers must not infringe on the rights  of tenants to organize an association of tenants. Borrowers (or a  designated management representative) should be available and willing to  work with a tenant organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Community rooms. Borrowers may not place unreasonable  restrictions on tenants that desire to use a community room.</p>
