                            <p class="depth0">The Federal estate tax imposed both with respect to the estates of  citizens or residents and with respect to estates of nonresidents not  citizens is payable by the executor or administrator of the decedent's  estate. This duty applies to the entire tax, regardless of the fact that  the gross estate consists in part of property which does not come within  the possession of the executor or administrator. If there is no executor  or administrator appointed, qualified and acting in the United States,  any person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the  decedent is required to pay the entire tax to the extent of the value of  the property in his possession. See section 2203, defining the term  ``executor''. The personal liability of the executor or such other  person is described in section 3467 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C.  192) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person, who  pays, in whole or in part, any debt due by the person or estate for whom  or for which he acts before he satisfies and pays the debts due to the  United States from such person or estate, shall become answerable in his  own person and estate to the extent of such payments for the debts so  due to the United States, or for so much thereof as may remain due and  unpaid.   As used in said section, the word ``debt'' includes a beneficiary's  distributive share of an estate. Thus, if the executor pays a debt due  by the decedent's estate or distributes any portion of the estate before  all the estate tax is paid, he is personally liable, to the extent of  the payment or distribution, for so much of the estate tax as remains  due and unpaid. In addition, section 6324(a)(2) provides that if the  estate tax is not paid when due, then the spouse, transferee, trustee  (except the trustee of an employee's trust which meets the requirements  of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, person in possession of the  property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power  of appointment, or beneficiary, who receives, or has on the date of the  decedent's death, property included in the gross estate under section  2034 through 2042, is personally liable for the tax to the extent of the  value, at the time of the decedent's death, of such property. See also  the following related sections of the Internal Revenue Code: Section  2204, discharge of executor from personal liability; section 2205,  reimbursement out of estate; sections 2206 and 2207, liability of life  insurance beneficiaries and recipients of property over which decedent  had power of appointment; sections 6321 through 6325, concerning liens  for taxes; and section 6901(a)(1), concerning the liabilities of  transferees and fiduciaries.

The  allowable credit is the applicable credit amount. See paragraph (d)(1)  of this section for an explanation of the term applicable credit amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule in case of certain gifts made before 1977. The  applicable credit amount allowable under paragraph (a) of this section  must be reduced by an amount equal to 20 percent of the aggregate amount  allowed as a specific exemption under section 2521 (as in effect before  its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1976) for gifts made by the decedent  after September 8, 1976, and before January 1, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit limitation. The applicable credit amount allowed under  paragraph (a) of this section cannot exceed the amount of the estate tax  imposed by section 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Explanation of terms. The explanation of terms in this section  applies to this section and to Sec. Sec. 20.2010-2T and 20.2010-3T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable credit amount. The term applicable credit amount  refers to the allowable credit against estate tax imposed by section  2001 and gift tax imposed by section 2501. The applicable credit amount  equals the amount of the tentative tax that would be determined under  section 2001(c) if the amount on which such tentative tax is to be  computed were equal to the applicable exclusion amount. The applicable  credit amount is determined by applying the unified rate schedule in  section 2001(c) to the applicable exclusion amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable exclusion amount. The applicable exclusion amount  equals the sum of the basic exclusion amount and, in the case of a  surviving spouse, the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basic exclusion amount. The basic exclusion amount is the sum  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For any decedent dying in calendar year 2011, $5,000,000; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any decedent dying after calendar year 2011, $5,000,000  multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section  1(f)(3) for that calendar year by substituting ``calendar year 2010''  for ``calendar year 1992'' in section 1(f)(3)(B) and by rounding to the  nearest multiple of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount. The term DSUE  amount refers, generally, to the unused portion of a decedent's  applicable exclusion amount to the extent this amount does not exceed  the basic exclusion amount in effect in the year of the decedent's  death. For rules on computing the DSUE amount, see Sec. Sec. 20.2010- 2T(c) and 20.2010-3T(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Last deceased spouse. The term last deceased spouse means the  most recently deceased individual who, at that individual's death after  December 31, 2010, was married to the surviving spouse. See Sec. Sec.  20.2010-3T(a) and 25.2505-2T(a) of this chapter for additional rules  pertaining to the identity of the last deceased spouse for purposes of  determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4),  and (d)(5) of this section apply to the estates of decedents dying in  calendar year 2011 or a subsequent year in which the applicable  exclusion amount is determined under section 2010(c) of the Internal   Revenue Code by adding the basic exclusion amount and, in the case of a  surviving spouse, the DSUE amount. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d)(1)  of this section apply to the estates of decedents dying on or after June  15, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Expiration date. The applicability of this section expires on or  before June 15, 2015.  [T.D. 9593, 77 FR 36157, June 18, 2012]    Sec. 20.2010-2T  Portability provisions applicable to estate of a  decedent survived by a spouse (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election required for portability. To allow a decedent's  surviving spouse to take into account that decedent's deceased spousal  unused exclusion (DSUE) amount, the executor of the decedent's estate  must elect portability of the DSUE amount on a timely-filed Form 706,  ``United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return''  (estate tax return). This election is referred to in this section and in  Sec. 20.2010-3T as the portability election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timely filing required. An estate that elects portability will  be considered, for purposes of Subtitle B and Subtitle F of the Internal  Revenue Code (Code), to be required to file a return under section  6018(a). Accordingly, the due date of an estate tax return required to  elect portability is 9 months after the decedent's date of death or the  last day of the period covered by an extension (if an extension of time  for filing has been obtained). See Sec. Sec. 20.6075-1 and 20.6081-1  for additional rules relating to the time for filing estate tax returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Portability election upon filing of estate tax return. Upon the  timely filing of a complete and properly-prepared estate tax return, an  executor of an estate of a decedent (survived by a spouse) will have  elected portability of the decedent's DSUE amount unless the executor  chooses not to elect portability and satisfies the requirement in  paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. See paragraph (a)(7) of this  section for the return requirements related to the portability election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Portability election not made; requirements for election not to  apply. The executor of the estate of a decedent (survived by a spouse)  will not make or be considered to make the portability election if  either of the following applies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The executor states affirmatively on a timely-filed estate tax  return, or in an attachment to that estate tax return, that the estate  is not electing portability under section 2010(c)(5). The manner in  which the executor may make this affirmative statement on the estate tax  return will be as set forth in the instructions issued with respect to  such form (``Instructions for Form 706'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The executor does not timely file an estate tax return in  accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election irrevocable. An executor of the estate of a decedent  (survived by a spouse) who timely files an estate tax return may make  and may supersede a portability election previously made, provided that  the estate tax return reporting the decision not to make a portability  election is filed on or before the due date of the return, including  extensions actually granted. However, see paragraph (a)(6) of this  section when contrary elections are made by more than one person  permitted to make the election. The portability election, once made,  becomes irrevocable once the due date of the estate tax return,  including extensions actually granted, has passed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Estates eligible to make the election. An executor may elect  portability on behalf of the estate of a decedent (survived by a spouse)  if the decedent dies in calendar year 2011 or during a subsequent period  in which portability of a DSUE amount is in effect. However, an executor  of the estate of a nonresident decedent who was not a citizen of the  United States at the time of death may not elect portability on behalf  of that decedent, and the timely filing of such a decedent's estate tax  return will not constitute the making of a portability election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Persons permitted to make the election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Appointed executor.  An executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent (survived by a  spouse) that is appointed, qualified, and acting within the United  States, within the meaning of section 2203 (an appointed executor), may  file the estate tax return on behalf of the estate of the decedent and,  in so   doing, elect portability of the decedent's DSUE amount. An appointed  executor also may elect not to have portability apply pursuant to  paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-appointed executor. If there is no appointed executor, any  person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the  decedent (a non-appointed executor) may file the estate tax return on  behalf of the estate of the decedent and, in so doing, elect portability  of the decedent's DSUE amount, or, by complying with paragraph (a)(3) of  this section, may elect not to have portability apply. A portability  election made by a non-appointed executor cannot be superseded by a  contrary election made by another non-appointed executor of that same  decedent's estate (unless such other non-appointed executor is the  successor of the non-appointed executor who made the election). See  Sec. 20.6018-2 for additional rules relating to persons permitted to  file the estate tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Requirements of return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An estate tax return  will be considered complete and properly-prepared for purposes of this  section if it is prepared in accordance with the instructions issued for  the estate tax return (Instructions for Form 706) and if the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 20.6018-2, 20.6018-3, and 20.6018-4 are  satisfied. However, see paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section for reduced  requirements applicable to certain property of certain estates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A))</em> and will be required to report only the  description, ownership, and/or beneficiary of such property, along with  all other information necessary to establish the right of the estate to  the deduction in accordance with Sec. Sec. 20.2056(a)-1(b)(i) through  (iii) and 20.2055-1(c), as applicable. However, this rule does not apply  to marital deduction property or charitable deduction property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of such property relates to, affects, or is needed to  determine, the value passing from the decedent to another recipient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of such property is needed to determine the estate's  eligibility for the provisions of sections 2032, 2032A, 6166, or another  provision of the Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Less than the entire value of an interest in property includible  in the decedent's gross estate is marital deduction property or  charitable deduction property; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A partial disclaimer or partial qualified terminable interest  property (QTIP) election is made with respect to a bequest, devise, or  transfer of property includible in the gross estate, part of which is  marital deduction property or charitable deduction property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Statement required on the return. Paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of  this section applies only if the executor exercises due diligence to  estimate the fair market value of the gross estate, including the  property described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section. The  Instructions for Form 706 will provide ranges of dollar values, and the  executor must identify on the estate tax return an amount corresponding  to the particular range within which falls the executor's best estimate  of the total gross estate. Until such time as the prescribed form for  the estate tax return expressly includes this estimate in the manner  described in the preceding sentence, the executor must include the  executor's best estimate, rounded to the nearest $250,000, on or  attached to the estate tax return, signed under penalties of perjury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. In each example, assume that  Husband (H) dies in 2011, survived by his wife (W), that both H and W  are US citizens, that H's gross estate does not exceed the excess of the  applicable exclusion amount for the   year of his death over the total amount of H's adjusted taxable gifts  and any specific exemption under section 2521, and that H's executor (E)  timely files Form 706 solely to make the portability election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The assets includible in H's gross estate  consist of a parcel of real property and bank accounts held jointly with  W with rights of survivorship, a life insurance policy payable to W, and  a survivor annuity payable to W for her life. H made no taxable gifts  during his lifetime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section. The estate tax return is considered  complete and properly prepared and E has elected portability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. H's will, duly admitted to probate and not  subject to any proceeding to challenge its validity, provides that H's  entire estate is to be distributed to a QTIP trust for W. The non- probate assets includible in H's gross estate consist of a life  insurance policy payable to H's children from a prior marriage, and H's  individual retirement account (IRA) payable to W. H made no taxable  gifts during his lifetime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of  this section. The estate tax return is considered complete and properly  prepared and E has elected portability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Variation. The facts are the same except that there are no  non-probate assets, and E elects to make only a partial QTIP election.  In this case, the regular return requirements apply to all of the  property includible in the gross estate and the provisions of paragraph  (a)(7)(ii) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. H's will, duly admitted to probate and not  subject to any proceeding to challenge its validity, provides that 50  percent of the property passing under the terms of H's will is to be  paid to a marital trust for W and 50 percent is to be paid to a trust  for W and their descendants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation required for portability election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  In addition to the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this  section, an executor of a decedent's estate must include a computation  of the DSUE amount on the estate tax return to elect portability and  thereby allow the decedent's surviving spouse to take into account that  decedent's DSUE amount. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a  transitional rule when the estate tax return form prescribed by the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not show expressly the computation  of the DSUE amount. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules on  computing the DSUE amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transitional rule. Until such time as the prescribed form for  the estate tax return expressly includes a computation of the DSUE  amount, a complete and properly-prepared estate tax return will be  deemed to include the computation of the DSUE amount. See paragraph  (a)(7) of this section for the requirements for a return to be  considered complete and properly-prepared. Once the IRS revises the  prescribed   form for the estate tax return to include expressly the computation of  the DSUE amount, executors that previously filed an estate tax return  pursuant to this transitional rule will not be required to file a  supplemental estate tax return using the revised form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of the DSUE amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Subject to  paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, the DSUE amount of a  decedent with a surviving spouse is the lesser of the following  amounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The basic exclusion amount in effect in the year of the death of  the decedent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The decedent's applicable exclusion amount; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the amount of the taxable estate and the amount of  the adjusted taxable gifts of the decedent, which together is the amount  on which the tentative tax on the decedent's estate is determined under  section 2001(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule to consider gift taxes paid by decedent. Solely for  purposes of computing the decedent's DSUE amount, the amount of the  adjusted taxable gifts of the decedent referred to in paragraph  (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section is reduced by the amount, if any, on which  gift taxes were paid for the calendar year of the gift(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule in case of property passing to qualified domestic  trust. When property passes for the benefit of a surviving spouse in a  qualified domestic trust (QDOT) as defined in section 2056A(a), the DSUE  amount of the decedent is computed on the decedent's estate tax return  for the purpose of electing portability in the same manner as this  amount is computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but this DSUE  amount is subject to subsequent adjustments. The DSUE amount of the  decedent must be redetermined upon the occurrence of the final  distribution or other event (generally the death of the surviving spouse  or the earlier termination of all QDOTs for that surviving spouse) on  which estate tax is imposed under section 2056A. See Sec. 20.2056A-6  for rules on determining the estate tax under section 2056A. See Sec.  20.2010-3T(c)(2) regarding the timing of the availability of the  decedent's DSUE amount to the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2002, having  made no prior taxable gift, Husband (H) makes a taxable gift valued at  $1,000,000 and reports the gift on a timely-filed gift tax return.  Because the amount of the gift is equal to the applicable exclusion  amount for that year ($1,000,000), $345,800 is allowed as a credit  against the tax, reducing the gift tax liability to zero. H dies on  September 29, 2011, survived by Wife (W). H and W are US citizens and  neither has any prior marriage. H's taxable estate is $1,000,000. The  executor of H's estate timely files H's estate tax return and elects  portability, thereby allowing W to benefit from H's DSUE amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. The executor of H's estate computes H's DSUE  amount to be $3,000,000 (the lesser of the $5,000,000 basic exclusion  amount in 2011, or the excess of H's $5,000,000 applicable exclusion  amount over the sum of the $1,000,000 taxable estate and the $1,000,000  amount of adjusted taxable gifts).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the value of H's  taxable gift in 2002 is $2,000,000. After application of the applicable  credit amount, H owes gift tax on $1,000,000, the amount of the gift in  excess of the applicable exclusion amount for that year. H pays the gift  tax owed on the transfer in 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. On H's death, the executor of H's estate computes  the DSUE amount to be $3,000,000 (the lesser of the $5,000,000 basic  exclusion amount in 2011, or the excess of H's $5,000,000 applicable  exclusion amount over the sum of the $1,000,000 taxable estate and  $1,000,000 adjusted taxable gifts). H's adjusted taxable gifts of  $2,000,000 were reduced for purposes of this computation by $1,000,000,  the amount of taxable gifts on which gift taxes were paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  Husband (H), a US citizen, makes his first taxable gift in 2002, valued  at $1,000,000, and reports the gift on a timely-filed gift tax return.  No gift tax is due because the applicable exclusion amount for that year  ($1,000,000) equals the fair market value of the gift. H dies in 2011  with a gross estate of $2,000,000. H's wife (W) is a US resident but not  a citizen of the United States and, under H's will, a pecuniary bequest  of $1,500,000 passes to a QDOT for the benefit of W. H's executor timely  files an estate tax return and makes the QDOT election for the property  passing to the QDOT, and H's estate is allowed a marital deduction of  $1,500,000 under section 2056(d) for the value of that property. H's  taxable estate is $500,000. On H's estate tax return, H's   executor computes H's preliminary DSUE amount to be $3,500,000 (the  lesser of the $5,000,000 basic exclusion amount in 2011, or the excess  of H's $5,000,000 applicable exclusion amount over the sum of the  $500,000 taxable estate and the $1,000,000 adjusted taxable gifts). No  taxable events within the meaning of section 2056A occur during W's  lifetime with respect to the QDOT, and W makes no taxable gifts. In  2012, W dies and the value of the assets of the QDOT is $1,800,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application.

This section applies to the  estates of decedents dying in calendar year 2011 or a subsequent year in  which the applicable exclusion amount is determined under section  2010(c) of the Code by adding the basic exclusion amount and, in the  case of a surviving spouse, the DSUE amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Expiration date.

A deceased spousal unused exclusion  (DSUE) amount of a decedent, computed under Sec. 20.2010-2T(c), is  included in determining a surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount  under section 2010(c)(2), provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such decedent is the last deceased spouse of such surviving  spouse within the meaning of Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) on the date of the  death of the surviving spouse; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The executor of the decedent's estate elected portability (see  Sec. 20.2010-2T(a) and (b) for applicable requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No DSUE amount available from last deceased spouse. If the last  deceased spouse of such surviving spouse had no DSUE amount, or if the  executor of such a decedent's estate did not make a portability  election, the surviving spouse's estate has no DSUE amount (except as  provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) to be included in  determining the applicable exclusion amount, even if the surviving  spouse previously had a DSUE amount available from another decedent who,  prior to the death of the last deceased spouse, was the last deceased  spouse of such surviving spouse. See paragraph (b) of this section for a  special rule in the case of multiple deceased spouses and a previously- applied DSUE amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent  marriage or divorce. A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined  in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5)) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of  the death of the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse is married to  another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again  and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death  of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased  spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced  spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the  last deceased spouse as that term is defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule in case of multiple deceased spouses and  previously-applied DSUE amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A special rule applies  to compute the DSUE amount included in the applicable exclusion amount  of a surviving spouse who previously has applied the DSUE amount of one  or more deceased spouses to taxable gifts in accordance with Sec.  25.2505-2T(b) and (c) of this chapter. If a surviving spouse has applied  the DSUE amount of one or more last deceased spouses to the surviving  spouse's transfers during life, and if   any of those last deceased spouses is different from the surviving  spouse's last deceased spouse as defined in Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5) at  the time of the surviving spouse's death, then the DSUE amount to be  included in determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving  spouse at the time of the surviving spouse's death is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DSUE amount of the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse  as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The DSUE amount of each other deceased spouse of the surviving  spouse, to the extent that such amount was applied to one or more  taxable gifts of the surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example, in which all described  individuals are US citizens, illustrates the application of this  paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Husband 1 (H1) dies on January 15, 2011,  survived by Wife (W). Neither has made any taxable gifts during H1's  lifetime. H1's executor elects portability of H1's DSUE amount. The DSUE  amount of H1 as computed on the estate tax return filed on behalf of  H1's estate is $5,000,000. On December 31, 2011, W makes taxable gifts  to her children valued at $2,000,000. W reports the gifts on a timely- filed gift tax return. W is considered to have applied $2,000,000 of  H1's DSUE amount to the amount of taxable gifts, in accordance with  Sec. 25.2505-2T(c), and, therefore, W owes no gift tax. W has an  applicable exclusion amount remaining in the amount of $8,000,000  ($3,000,000 of H1's remaining DSUE amount plus W's own $5,000,000 basic  exclusion amount). After the death of H1, W marries Husband 2 (H2). H2  dies in June 2012. H2's executor elects portability of H2's DSUE amount,  which is properly computed on H2's estate tax return to be $2,000,000. W  dies in October 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. The DSUE amount to be included in determining the  applicable exclusion amount available to W's estate is $4,000,000,  determined by adding the $2,000,000 DSUE amount of H2 and the $2,000,000  DSUE amount of H1 that was applied by W to W's 2011 taxable gifts. Thus,  W's applicable exclusion amount is $9,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Date DSUE amount taken into consideration by surviving spouse's  estate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A portability election made by an executor of  a decedent's estate (see Sec. 20.2010-2T(a) and (b) for applicable  requirements) applies as of the date of the decedent's death. Thus, the  decedent's DSUE amount is included in the applicable exclusion amount of  the decedent's surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) and will be  applicable to transfers made by the surviving spouse after the  decedent's death. However, such decedent's DSUE amount will not be  included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse,  even if the surviving spouse had made a transfer in reliance on the  availability or computation of the decedent's DSUE amount:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the executor of the decedent's estate supersedes the  portability election by filing a subsequent estate tax return in  accordance with Sec. 20.2010-2T(a)(4);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that the DSUE amount subsequently is reduced by a  valuation adjustment or the correction of an error in calculation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that the surviving spouse cannot substantiate  the DSUE amount claimed on the surviving spouse's return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authority to examine returns of deceased spouses. For the  purpose of determining the DSUE amount to be included in the applicable  exclusion   amount of the surviving spouse, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may  examine returns of each of the surviving spouse's deceased spouses whose  DSUE amount is claimed to be included in the surviving spouse's  applicable exclusion amount, regardless of whether the period of  limitations on assessment has expired for any such return. The IRS's  authority to examine returns of a deceased spouse applies with respect  to each transfer by the surviving spouse to which a DSUE amount is or  has been applied. Upon examination, the IRS may adjust or eliminate the  DSUE amount reported on such a return; however, the IRS may assess  additional tax on that return only if that tax is assessed within the  period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 applicable to the  tax shown on that return. See also section 7602 for the IRS's authority,  when ascertaining the correctness of any return, to examine any returns  that may be relevant or material to such inquiry. For purposes of these  examinations to determine the DSUE amount, the surviving spouse is  considered to have a material interest that is affected by the return  information of the deceased spouse within the meaning of section  6103(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Availability of DSUE amount for estates of nonresidents who are  not citizens. The estate of a nonresident surviving spouse who is not a  citizen of the United States at the time of such surviving spouse's  death shall not take into account the DSUE amount of any deceased spouse  of such surviving spouse within the meaning of Sec. 20.2010-1T(d)(5)  except to the extent allowed under any applicable treaty obligation of  the United States. See section 2102(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date.
