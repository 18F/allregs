A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Department. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.</p>
