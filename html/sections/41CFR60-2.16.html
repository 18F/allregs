                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose: Placement goals serve as objectives or targets reasonably attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all aspects of the entire affirmative action program work. Placement goals also are used to measure progress toward achieving equal employment opportunity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A contractor's determination under Sec. 60-2.15 that a placement goal is required constitutes neither a finding nor an admission of discrimination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where, pursuant to Sec. 60-2.15, a contractor is required to establish a placement goal for a particular job group, the contractor must establish a percentage annual placement goal at least equal to the availability figure derived for women or minorities, as appropriate, for that job group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The placement goal-setting process described above contemplates that contractors will, where required, establish a single goal for all minorities. In the event of a substantial disparity in the utilization of a particular minority group or in the utilization of men or women of a particular minority group, a contractor may be required to establish separate goals for those groups.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In establishing placement goals, the following principles also apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Placement goals may not be rigid and inflexible quotas, which must be met, nor are they to be considered as either a ceiling or a floor for the employment of particular groups. Quotas are expressly forbidden.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In all employment decisions, the contractor must make selections in a nondiscriminatory manner. Placement

goals do not provide the contractor with a justification to extend a preference to any individual, select an individual, or adversely affect an individual's employment status, on the basis of that person's race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Placement goals do not create set-asides for specific groups, nor are they intended to achieve proportional representation or equal results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Placement goals may not be used to supersede merit selection principles. Affirmative action programs prescribed by the regulations in this part do not require a contractor to hire a person who lacks qualifications to perform the job successfully, or hire a less qualified person in preference to a more qualified one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A contractor extending a publicly announced preference for American Indians as is authorized in 41 CFR 60-1.5(a)(6) may reflect in its placement goals the permissive employment preference for American Indians living on or near an Indian reservation.
