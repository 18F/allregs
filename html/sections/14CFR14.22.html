The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the ALJ or adjudicative officer upon request by the FAA's counsel and the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested
