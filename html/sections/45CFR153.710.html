                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Enrollment, claims, and encounter data. An issuer of a risk adjustment covered plan or a reinsurance-eligible plan in a State in which HHS is operating the risk adjustment or reinsurance program, as applicable, must provide to HHS, through the dedicated data environment, access to enrollee-level plan enrollment data, enrollee claims data, and enrollee encounter data as specified by HHS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Claims data. All claims data submitted by an issuer of a risk adjustment covered plan or a reinsurance-eligible plan in a State in which HHS is operating the risk adjustment or reinsurance program, as applicable, must have resulted in payment by the issuer (or payment of cost sharing by the enrollee).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Claims data from capitated plans. An issuer of a risk adjustment covered plan or a reinsurance-eligible plan in a State in which HHS is operating the risk adjustment or reinsurance program, as applicable, that does not generate individual enrollee claims in the normal course of business must derive the costs of all applicable provider encounters using its principal internal methodology for pricing those encounters. If the issuer does not have such a methodology, or has an incomplete methodology, it must supplement the methodology in a manner that yields derived claims that are reasonable in light of the specific service and insurance market that the plan is serving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interim dedicated distributed data environment reports. Within 30 calendar days of the date of an interim dedicated distributed data environment report from HHS, the issuer must, in a format specified by HHS, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirm to HHS that the information in the interim report accurately reflects the data to which the issuer has provided access to HHS through its dedicated distributed data environment in accordance with Sec. 153.700(a) for the timeframe specified in the report; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Describe to HHS any discrepancy it identifies in the interim dedicated distributed data environment report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Final dedicated distributed data environment report. Within 15 calendar days of the date of the final dedicated distributed data environment report from HHS, the issuer must, in a format specified by HHS, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirm to HHS that the information in the final report accurately reflects the data to which the issuer has provided access to HHS through its dedicated distributed data environment in accordance with Sec. 153.700(a) for

the benefit year specified in the report; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Describe to HHS any discrepancy it identifies in the final dedicated distributed data environment report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Unresolved discrepancies. If a discrepancy first identified in an interim or final dedicated distributed data environment report in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) or (e)(2) of this section remains unresolved after the issuance of the notification of risk adjustment payments and charges or reinsurance payments under Sec. 153.310(e) or Sec. 153.240(b)(1)(ii), respectively, an issuer of a risk adjustment covered plan or reinsurance-eligible plan may make a request for reconsideration regarding such discrepancy under the process set forth in Sec. 156.1220(a) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Risk corridors and MLR reporting. (1) Notwithstanding any discrepancy report made under paragraph (d)(2) or (e)(2) of this section, or any request for reconsideration under Sec. 156.1220(a) of this subchapter with respect to any risk adjustment payment or charge, including an assessment of risk adjustment user fees; reinsurance payment; cost-sharing reconciliation payment or charge; or risk corridors payment or charge, unless the dispute has been resolved, an issuer must report, for purposes of the risk corridors and MLR programs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The risk adjustment payment to be made or charge assessed, including an assessment of risk adjustment user fees, by HHS in the notification provided under Sec. 153.310(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reinsurance payment to be made by HHS in the notification provided under Sec. 153.240(b)(1)(ii);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A cost-sharing reduction amount equal to the amount of the advance payments of cost-sharing reductions paid to the issuer by HHS for the benefit year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For medical loss ratio report only, the risk corridors payment to be made or charge assessed by HHS as reflected in the notification provided under Sec. 153.510(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An issuer must report any adjustment made following any discrepancy report made under paragraph (d)(2) or (e)(2) of this section, or any request for reconsideration under Sec. 156.1220(a) of this subchapter with respect to any risk adjustment payment or charge, including an assessment of risk adjustment user fees; reinsurance payment; cost-sharing reconciliation payment or charge; or risk corridors payment or charge; or following any audit, where such adjustment has not be accounted for in a prior risk corridors or medical loss ratio report, in the next following risk corridors or medical loss ratio report.
