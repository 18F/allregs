                            <p class="depth0">Section 13 requires that the amount of the bond be fixed at the  beginning of each calendar, policy or other fiscal year, as the case may  be, which constitutes the reporting year of the plan for purposes of the  reporting provisions of the Act. The amount of the bond shall be not  less than 10 per centum of the amount of funds handled, except that any  such bond shall be in at least the amount of $1,000 and no such bond  shall be required in an amount in excess of $500,000: Provided, That the  Secretary, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to all  interested parties, and after consideration of the record, may prescribe  an amount in excess of $500,000, which in no event shall exceed 10 per  centum of the funds handled. For purposes of fixing the amount of such  bond, the amount of funds handled shall be determined by the funds  handled by the person, group, or class to be covered by such bond and by  their predecessor or predecessors, if any, during the preceding  reporting year, or if the plan has no preceding reporting year, the  amount of funds to be handled during the current reporting year by such  person, group, or class, estimated as provided in the regulations in  this part. With respect to persons required to be bonded, section 13  shall be deemed to require the bond to insure from the first dollar of  loss up to the requisite bond amount and not to permit the use of  deductible or similar features whereby a portion of the risk within such  requisite bond amount is assumed by the insured. Any request for  variance from these requirements shall be made pursuant to the  provisions of section 13(e) of the Act.</p>
