                            <p class="depth0">The food additive polysorbate 65 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan  tristearate), which is a mixture of polyoxyethylene ethers of mixed  stearic acid esters of sorbitol anhydrides and related compounds, may be  safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed  conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The food additive is manufactured by reacting stearic acid  (usually containing associated fatty acids, chiefly palmitic) with  sorbitol to yield a product with a maximum acid number of 15 and a  maximum water content of 0.2 percent, which is then reacted with  ethylene oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The food additive meets the following specifications:  Saponification number 88-98. Acid number 0-2. Hydroxyl number 44-60. Oxyethylene content 46 percent-50 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The additive is used, or intended for use, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As an emulsifier in ice cream, frozen custard, ice milk, fruit  sherbet and nonstandardized frozen desserts when used alone or in  combination with polysorbate 80, whereby the maximum amount of the  additives, alone or in combination, does not exceed 0.1 percent of the  finished frozen dessert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an emulsifier in cakes and cake mixes, with or without one or  a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sorbitan monostearate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60.   When used alone, the maximum amount of polysorbate 65 shall not exceed  0.32 percent of the cake or cake mix, on a dry-weight basis. When used  with sorbitan monostearate and/or polysorbate 60, it shall not exceed  0.32 percent, nor shall the sorbitan monostearate exceed 0.61 percent or  the polysorbate 60 exceed 0.46 percent, and no combination of these  emulsifiers shall exceed 0.66 percent of the cake or cake mix, all  calculated on a dry-weight basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an emulsifier in whipped edible oil topping with or without  one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sorbitan monostearate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Polysorbate 80;   whereby the maximum amount of the additive or additives used does not  exceed 0.4 percent of the weight of the finished whipped edible oil  topping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an emulsifier in solid-state, edible vegetable fat-water  emulsions intended for use as substitutes for milk or cream in beverage  coffee, with or without one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sorbitan monostearate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60.   The maximum amount of the additive or additives shall not exceed 0.4  percent by weight of the finished edible vegetable fat-water emulsion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As an emulsifier in cake icings and cake fillings, with or  without one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sorbitan monostearate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60.   When used alone, the maximum amount of polysorbate 65 shall not exceed  0.32 percent of the weight of the cake icing or cake filling. When used  with sorbitan monostearate and/or polysorbate 60, it shall not exceed  0.32 percent, nor shall the sorbitan monostearate exceed 0.7 percent or  the polysorbate 60 exceed 0.46 percent, and no combination of these  emulsifiers shall exceed 1 percent of the weight of the cake icing or  cake filling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To assure safe use of the additive, in addition to the other  information required by the Act:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label of the additive and any intermediate premixes shall  bear:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the additive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the concentration or strength of the additive in  any intermediate premixes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label or labeling shall bear adequate directions to provide  a final product that complies with the limitations prescribed in  paragraph (c) of this section.
