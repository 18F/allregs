                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of an ocean vessel carrying animals from the United States to a foreign country shall provide, for such animals, feed and water, space, ventilation, fittings, and other facilities aboard the carrier as set forth in this part. For animals embarked for a voyage which will be of more than 36 hours duration, there shall be provided to the satisfaction of the inspector sufficient amounts of suitable feed and fresh water, and proper accommodations shall be provided on board for storage and distribution of the water and feed. The feed shall not be exposed to the weather at sea. However, such feed and water shall not be required if it is determined by the APHIS veterinarian that the animals, if under 30 days of age will arrive in the country of destination within 24 hours after they were last fed and watered in the United States, or, in the case of other animals, within 36 hours after they were last fed and watered in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Owners masters, or operators of such vessels shall not accept for transportation any animal that in the judgment of the APHIS veterinarian is in an unfit condition to withstand the rigors of such transportation. Further, no animal intended for export shall be placed aboard any ocean vessel, unless in the opinion of the inspector the loading arrangements, fittings, ventilation systems, and the arrangements provided by the vessel for their use reasonably assure arrival of a viable animal in the country of destination. Halters, ropes, or other suitable equipment provided for the handling and tying of horses shall be found to be satisfactory by the APHIS veterinarian to assure humane treatment of the animals.
