                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractors should contribute a reasonable amount of the total  project cost covered under the contract. The ratio of cost participation  should correlate to the apparent advantages available to performers and  the proximity of implementing commercialization, i.e., the higher the  potential for future profits, the higher the contractor's share should  be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fee will not be paid to the contractor or any member of the  contractor team (subcontractors and consultants) which has a substantial  and direct interest in the contract, or is in a position to gain long  term benefits from the contract. A vulnerability the Contracting Officer  should consider in reviewing a prime contractor's request for consent to  subcontract is whether subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts  have a significant direct interest in the contract to gain long-term  benefits from the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contracting Officer, with the input of technical experts,  may consider the following factors in determining reasonable levels of  cost sharing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The availability of the technology to competitors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Improvements in the contractor's market share position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time and risk necessary to achieve success;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the results of the project involve patent rights which could  be sold or licensed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the contractor has non-Federal sources of funds to include as  cost participation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the contractor has the production and other capabilities to  capitalize the results of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A contractor's cost participation can be provided by other  subcontractors with which it has contractual arrangements to perform the  contract as long as the contractor's cost-sharing goal is met.
