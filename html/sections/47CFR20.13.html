                                Sec. 20.13  State petitions for authority to regulate rates.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> States may petition for authority to regulate the intrastate  rates of any commercial mobile radio service. The petition must include  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for  commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers  to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are  unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's  petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market  conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect  subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that  are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial  portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state  or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining  basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range  of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the  state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types  of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent  to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission  in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the  state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service  providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have  offered service in the state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service  provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during  the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable  period if annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of  return for each   commercial mobile radio service provider;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service  provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most  recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if  annual data is unavailable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the  commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate  are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of  competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person  with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory  practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in  the state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with  particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or  rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon  commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should  include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs.  Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the  inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the  state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be  considered especially probative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Information regarding customer satisfaction or  dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile radio service  providers, including statistics and other information about complaints  filed with the state regulatory commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Petitions must include a certification that the state agency  filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for  the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the  state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file  comments in support or in opposition to the petition within 30 days  after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this  section. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the  expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings  may be filed. Except for Sec. 1.45 of this chapter, practice and  procedure rules contained in Sec. Sec. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter shall  apply. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not  apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by a state  under this paragraph not later than the end of the nine-month period  after the filing of the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the  state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio services in the  state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the  Commission. The period of time specified by the Commission will be that  necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly  or unreasonably discriminatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of  June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under this section before  August 10, 1994, to extend this authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission shall act upon the petition (including any  reconsideration) not later than the end of the 12-month period following  the date of the filing of the petition by the state involved. Commercial  mobile radio service providers offering such service in the state shall  comply with the existing regulations of the state until the petition and  any reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any  petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No sooner than 18 months from grant of authority by the  Commission under this section for state rate regulations, any interested  party may petition the Commission for an order to   discontinue state authority for rate regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Petitions to discontinue state authority for rate regulation  must be based on recent empirical data or other significant evidence  demonstrating that the exercise of rate authority by a state is no  longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile are just  and reasonable or not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any interested party may file comments in support of or in  opposition to the petition within 30 days after public notice of the  filing of the petition. Any interested party may file a reply within 15  days after the time for filing comments has expired. No additional  pleadings may be filed. Except for 1.45 of this chapter, practice and  procedure rules contained in Sec. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter apply. The  provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by any  interested party under this paragraph within nine months after the  filing of the petition.</p>
