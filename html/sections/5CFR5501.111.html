otherwise prohibited by this section under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a determination by the NIH Director (or the Secretary, with respect to awards tendered to the NIH Director) that acceptance of the gift will further an agency interest because it confers an exceptionally high honor in the fields of medicine or scientific research.
