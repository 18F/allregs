Base and control stations must be licensed individually. A public safety entity meeting the requirements of Sec. 90.523 may operate mobile or portable units on the Interoperability channels in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands without a specific authorization from the Commission provided it holds a part 90 license. All persons operating mobile or portable units under this authority are responsible for compliance with part 90 of these rules and other applicable federal laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> License applications for Interoperability channels in the 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands must be approved by a state-level agency or organization responsible for administering state emergency communications. States may hold the licenses for Interoperability channels or approve other qualified entities to hold such licenses. States may delegate the approval process for interoperability channels to another entity, such as regional planning committees.
