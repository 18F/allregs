Unit

proof loads shall exceed the safe working load as follows:

Proof loads shall be applied at the designed maximum and minimum boom angles or radii, or, if this is impracticable, as close to these as practicable. The angles or radii of test shall be stated in the certificate of test. Proof loads shall be swung as far as possible in both directions. The weight of all auxiliary handling devices shall be considered a part of the load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After satisfactory completion of a unit proof load test, the derrick and all component parts thereof shall be carefully examined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1919.71(d), as far as applicable.</p>
