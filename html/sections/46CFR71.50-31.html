                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To continue to participate in the AHE Program, vessel operators  must conduct an annual hull condition assessment. At a minimum, vessel  operators must conduct an internal examination and take random hull  gaugings internally during the hull condition assessment, unless waived  by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). If the annual hull  assessment reveals significant damage or corrosion, where temporary  repairs have been made, or where other critical areas of concern have  been identified, the OCMI may require an expanded examination to include  an underwater hull examination using divers. If an underwater  examination is required, the examination must focus on areas at higher  risk of   damage or corrosion and must include a representative sampling of hull  gaugings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an underwater survey is required for the annual hull  condition assessment, the OCMI may require the presence of a third party  examiner and a written hull examination report must be submitted to the  OCMI. This report must include thickness gauging results, a copy of the  audio and video recordings and any other information that will help the  OCMI evaluate your vessel for continued participation in the AHE  program. The third party examiner must sign the report and confirm the  validity of its contents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must submit your preventive maintenance reports or  checklists on an annual basis to the OCMI. These reports or checklists  must conform to the plans you submitted in your application under Sec.   71.50-19 of this part, which the OCMI approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior to each scheduled annual hull condition assessment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner may submit to the OCMI a plan for conducting the  assessment, or a request for a waiver of this requirement, no fewer than  30 days before the scheduled assessment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OCMI may reduce the scope or extend the interval of the  assessment if the operational, casualty, and deficiency history of the  vessel, along with a recommendation of the vessel's master, indicates  that it is warranted.
