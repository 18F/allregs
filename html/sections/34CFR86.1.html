                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention regulations is to implement section 22 of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989, which added section 1213 to the Higher Education Act. These amendments require that, as a condition of receiving funds or any other form of financial assistance under any Federal program, an institution of higher education (IHE) must certify that it has adopted and implemented a drug prevention program as described in this part.
