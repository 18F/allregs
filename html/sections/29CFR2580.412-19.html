                                Sec. 2580.412-19  Term of the bond, discovery period, other
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Term of the bond. The amount of any required bond must in each instance be based on the amount of funds ``handled'' and must be fixed or estimated at the beginning of the plan's reporting year, that is, as soon after the date when such year begins as the necessary information from the preceding reporting year can practicably be ascertained. This does not mean, however, that a new bond must be obtained each year. There is nothing in the Act that prohibits a bond for a term longer than one year, with whatever advantages such a bond might offer by way of a lower premium. However, at the beginning of each reporting year the bond shall be in at least the requisite amount. If, for any reason, the bond is below the required level at that time, the existing bond shall either be increased to the proper amount, or a supplemental bond shall be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discovery period. A discovery period of no less than one year after the termination or cancellation of the bond is required. Any standard form written on a ``discovery'' basis, i.e., providing that a loss must be discovered within the bond period as a prerequisite to recovery of such loss, however, will not be required to have a discovery period if it contains a provision giving the insured the right to purchase a discovery period of one year in the event of termination or cancellation and the insured has already given the surety notice that it desires such discovery period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other bond clauses. A bond shall not be adequate to meet the requirements of section 13, if, with respect to

bonding coverage required under section 13, it contains a clause, or is otherwise, in contravention of the law of the State in which it is executed.</p>
