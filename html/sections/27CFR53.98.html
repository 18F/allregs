                                Sec. 53.98  Computation of tax on leases and installment sales.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Leases. When a taxable article is leased by a manufacturer,  producer, or importer, liability for tax is incurred, except as provided  by section 4217(b) of the Code and Sec. 53.104, on each payment made  with respect to such lease. Tax is payable on each lease payment as long  as the article is leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The  tax payable with respect to each lease payment is a percentage of each  payment   based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the lease  payment is due. If the article is subsequently sold by the manufacturer,  producer, or importer, the tax applies also to such sale, without regard  to the tax paid when the article was leased. For definition of the term  ``lease'', see Sec. 53.103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(A)</em> of the Code is $75, the percentage  which the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price is 75  percent. Accordingly, only 75 percent of each installment payment is  subject to tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sales on credit. Where articles are sold on credit under  conditions other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section,  the entire tax shall be reported and paid with the return covering the  period in which the sale is made, even though the price may not be paid  to the manufacturer, producer, or importer until a later date, or not  paid at all.</p>
