                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions are applicable throughout this part:</p><p class="depth0">Federal project. A project constructed by the Corps, and  subsequently turned over to a local sponsor for operations and  maintenance responsibility. This definition also includes any project  specifically designated as a Federal project by an Act of Congress.</p><p class="depth0">Flood control project: A project designed and constructed to have  appreciable and dependable effects in preventing damage from irregular  and unusual rises in water level. For a multipurpose project, only those  components that are necessary for the flood control function are  considered eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.</p><p class="depth0">Governor. All references in part 203 to the Governor of a State also  refer to: the Governors of United States commonwealths, territories, and  possessions; and the Mayor of Washington, D.C.</p><p class="depth0">Hurricane/Shore Protection Project (HSPP). A flood control project  designed and constructed to have appreciable and predictable effects in  preventing damage to developed areas from the impacts of hurricanes,  tsunamis, and coastal storms. These effects are primarily to protect  against wave action, storm surge, wind, and the complicating factors of  extraordinary high tides. HSPP's include projects known as shore  protection projects, shore protection structures, periodic nourishment  projects, shore enhancement projects, and similar terms. Components of  an HSPP may include both hard (permanent construction) and soft  (sacrificial, i.e., sand) features.</p><p class="depth0">Non-Federal project. A project constructed with non-Federal funds,  or a project constructed by tribal, State, local, or private interests,  or a component of such a project. A project constructed under Federal  emergency disaster authorities, such as Public Law 84-99 or the Robert  T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42  U.S.C. 5121, et seq.) (hereinafter referred to as the Stafford Act), is  a non-Federal project unless it repairs or replaces an existing Federal  project. Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects, and projects  funded completely or partially by other (non-Corps) Federal agencies,  are considered non-Federal projects for the application of Public Law  84-99 authority.</p><p class="depth0">Non-Federal sponsor. A non-Federal sponsor is a public entity that  is a legally constituted public body with full authority and capability  to perform the terms of its agreement as the non-Federal partner of the  Corps for a project, and able to pay damages, if necessary, in the event  of its failure to perform. A non-Federal sponsor may be a State, County,  City, Town, Federally recognized Indian Tribe or tribal organization,  Alaska Native Corporation, or any political subpart of a State or group  of states that has the legal and financial authority and capability to  provide the necessary cash contributions and LERRD's necessary for the  project.</p><p class="depth0">Repair and rehabilitation. The term ``repair and rehabilitation''  means the repair or rebuilding of a flood control structure, after the  structure has been damaged by a flood, hurricane, or coastal storm, to  the level of protection provided by the structure prior to the flood,  hurricane, or coastal storm. ``Repair and rehabilitation'' does not  include improvements (betterments) to   the structure, nor does ``repair and rehabilitation'' include any repair  or rebuilding of a flood control structure that, in the normal course of  usage, has become structurally unsound and is no longer fit to provide  the level of protection for which it was designed.</p>
