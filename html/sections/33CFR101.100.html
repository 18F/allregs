Chapter 701;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To align, where appropriate, the requirements of domestic  maritime security regulations with the international maritime security  standards in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea,  1974 (SOLAS Chapter XI-2) and the International Code for the Security of  Ships and of Port Facilities, parts A and B, adopted on 12 December  2002; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To ensure security arrangements are as compatible as possible  for vessels trading internationally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For those maritime elements of the national transportation  system where international standards do not directly apply, the  requirements in this subchapter emphasize cooperation and coordination  with local port community stakeholders, and are based on existing  domestic standards, as well as established industry security practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The assessments and plans required by this subchapter are  intended for use in implementing security measures at various MARSEC  Levels. The specific security measures and their implementation are  planning criteria based on a set of assumptions made during the  development of the security assessment and plan. These assumptions may  not exist during an actual transportation security incident.  [USCG-2003-14792, 68 FR 39278, July 1, 2003, as amended at 68 FR 60470,  Oct. 22, 2003]</p>
