                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This paragraph (a) applies on each occasion that any person transfers custody or title to MVNRLM diesel fuel, heating oil, or ECA marine fuel (including distillates used or intended to be used as MVNRLM diesel fuel, heating oil, or ECA marine fuel) except when such fuel is dispensed into motor vehicles or nonroad equipment, locomotives, marine diesel engines or C3 vessels. Note that 40 CFR part 1043 specifies requirements for documenting fuel transfers to certain marine vessels. For all fuel transfers subject to this paragraph (a), the transferor must provide to the transferee documents which include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The names and addresses of the transferor and transferee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The volume of diesel fuel or distillate which is being transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The location of the diesel fuel or distillate at the time of the transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For transfers of MVNRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel (beginning June 1, 2014), the sulfur content standard the transferor represents the fuel to meet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Beginning June 1, 2006, when an entity, from a facility at any point in the distribution system, transfers custody of a distillate or residual fuel designated under Sec. 80.598, the following information must also be included:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facility registration number of the transferor and transferee, for terminals and all parties upstream, under Sec. 80.597, if any.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An accurate and clear statement of the applicable designation and/or classification under Sec. 80.598(a) and (b), for example, ``500 ppm sulfur NRLM diesel fuel'', or ``jet fuel''; and whether the fuel is dyed or undyed, and for heating oil, whether marked or unmarked where applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For transfers of title or custody from one facility to another in the distribution system where diesel fuel or distillates are taxed, dyed or marked, and for any subsequent transfers (except when such fuel is dispensed into motor vehicles or nonroad, locomotive, or marine equipment), an accurate statement on the product transfer document of the applicable fuel uses and classifications, as follows (however, in instances where space is constrained, substantially similar language may be used following approval from EPA):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Undyed 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel. For the period from June 1, 2006 and beyond, ``15 ppm sulfur (maximum) Undyed Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel. For use in all diesel vehicles and engines.''

For the case where a pipeline delivers a batch of ULSD to another facility that contains slight amounts of another type of fuel from a preceding or following batch, a clear statement must be included on the PTD denoting this.
