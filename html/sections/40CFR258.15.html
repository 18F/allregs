                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners or operators of new MSWLF units, existing MSWLF units,  and lateral expansions located in an unstable area must demonstrate that  engineering measures have been incorporated into the MSWLF unit's design  to ensure that the integrity of the structural components of the MSWLF  unit will not be disrupted. The owner or operator must place the  demonstration in the operating record and notify the State Director that  it has been placed in the operating record. The owner or operator must  consider the following factors, at a minimum, when determining whether  an area is unstable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On-site or local soil conditions that may result in significant  differential settling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On-site or local geologic or geomorphologic features; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On-site or local human-made features or events (both surface and  subsurface).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unstable area means a location that is susceptible to natural or  human-induced events or forces capable of impairing the integrity of  some or all of the landfill structural components responsible for  preventing releases from a landfill. Unstable areas can include poor  foundation conditions, areas susceptible to mass movements, and Karst  terranes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Structural components means liners, leachate collection systems,  final covers, run-on/run-off systems, and any other component used in  the construction and operation of the MSWLF that is necessary for  protection of human health and the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Poor foundation conditions means those areas where features  exist which indicate that a natural or man-induced event may result in  inadequate foundation support for the structural components of an MSWLF  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Areas susceptible to mass movement means those areas of  influence (i.e., areas characterized as having an active or substantial  possibility of mass movement) where the movement of earth material at,  beneath, or adjacent to the MSWLF unit, because of natural or man- induced events, results in the downslope transport of soil and rock  material by means of gravitational influence. Areas of mass movement  include, but are not limited to, landslides, avalanches, debris slides  and flows, soil fluction, block sliding, and rock fall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Karst terranes means areas where karst topography, with its  characteristic surface and subterranean features, is developed as the  result of dissolution of limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  Characteristic physiographic features present in karst terranes include,  but are not limited to, sinkholes, sinking streams, caves, large  springs, and blind valleys.</p>
