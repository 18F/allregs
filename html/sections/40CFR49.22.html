                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to the owner or operator of  the project located on the Reservation of the Salt River Pima Maricopa  Indian Community (SRPMIC) in Arizona, including any new owner or  operator in the event of a change in ownership of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section.  Except as specifically defined herein, terms used in this section retain  the meaning accorded them under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth0">Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant  from an emissions unit as determined in paragraphs (1)-(3) of this  definition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal  the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted  the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the particular  date and which is representative of normal source operation. EPA shall  allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is  more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall  be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates,  and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the  selected time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EPA may presume that the source-specific allowable emissions for  the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For any emissions unit which has not begun normal operations on  the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit  of the unit on that date.</p><p class="depth0">Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of physical  on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a  permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to,  installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground  pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect  to a change in method of operating this term refers to those on-site  activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation  of the change.</p><p class="depth0">Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the  pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial  grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties,  and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common  control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting  activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping  if they belong to the same Major Group (i.e., which have the same two- digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial Classification  Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government  Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0065 and 003-005-00176-0,  respectively).</p><p class="depth0">Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary source or  major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary  preconstruction approvals or permits and either has: (1) Begun, or  caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-site construction of  the source, to be completed within a reasonable time; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations,  which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the  owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the  source to be completed within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth0">Construction means any physical change or change in the method of  operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or  modification of an emissions unit) which would result in a change in  actual emissions.</p><p class="depth0">EPA means United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9.</p><p class="depth0">Fugitive emissions means those emissions which could not reasonably  pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent  opening.</p><p class="depth0">Lowest achievable emission rate means the more stringent rate of  emissions based on the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The most stringent emissions limitation which is contained in  any State, Tribal, or federal implementation plan for such class or  category of stationary source, unless the owner or operator of the  project demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The most stringent emissions limitation which is achieved in  practice by such class or category of stationary sources. This  limitation, when applied to a modification, means the lowest achievable  emissions rate for the new or modified emissions units within a  stationary source. In no event shall the application of the term permit  a proposed new or modified stationary source to emit any pollutant in  excess of the amount allowable under an applicable new source standard  of performance.</p><p class="depth0">Major stationary source means a stationary source of air pollutants  which emits, or has the potential to emit, 100 tons per year or more of  any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act. The fugitive  emissions of a stationary source shall not be included in determining  for any of the purposes of this project whether it is a major stationary  source.</p><p class="depth0">Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source  to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any  physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to emit  a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions  on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted,  stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design only if   the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally  enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the  potential to emit of a stationary source.</p><p class="depth0">Project means the construction of electricity-generating engines  owned and operated by the Salt River Project at the Tri-Cities landfill,  which are fueled by collected landfill gas.</p><p class="depth0">Secondary emissions means emissions which would occur as a result of  the construction or operation of a major stationary source, but do not  come from the major stationary source itself. For the purpose of this  section, secondary emissions must be specific, well defined,  quantifiable, and impact the same general area as the stationary source  which causes the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include  emissions from any offsite support facility which would not be  constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the  construction of operation of the major stationary source. Secondary  emissions do not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile  source such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a  train, or from a vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or  installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to  regulation under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirement to submit an application. The owner or operator of  the project shall submit an application for a permit to construct to EPA  which contains all information necessary to perform any analysis or make  any determination as required by this Federal Implementation Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Source obligations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of the project  shall not begin actual construction on the project without obtaining a  nonattainment New Source Review permit regulating emissions of air  pollutants. The EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator has the authority to  issue such a permit. Any permit issued by EPA shall ensure that the  project meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By the time the project is to commence operation, the owner or  operator of the project must have obtained sufficient reductions in  actual emissions from existing facilities within the same nonattainment  area which satisfy the requirements of section 173 of the Clean Air Act,  to offset the potential to emit of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator of the project must comply with the  lowest achievable emissions rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator of the project must demonstrate that all  major stationary sources owned or operated by such person (or by any  entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such  person) located on the reservation of the SRPMIC are subject to emission  limitations and are in compliance, or on a schedule for compliance, with  all applicable emission limitations and standards under the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator of the project has provided an analysis  of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental  control techniques for the proposed source which demonstrates that  benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental  and social costs imposed as a result of its location or construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator constructs or operates the project not  in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or  with the terms of any approval to construct, or if the owner or operator  subject to this section commences construction after January 24 , 2000  without applying for and receiving approval under this section, then the  owner or operator shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is  not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if  construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if  construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The  Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing  that an extension is justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of  the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the  Federal implementation plan and any other requirements under Tribal or  Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Public participation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When issuing a permit for the project,  the EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator shall follow the procedures for  decision making for PSD permits contained in 40 CFR part 124, including  the requirements for public notice, consideration of and response to  public comment, and the opportunity for public hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 30 days after the EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator has  issued a final permit decision, any person who filed comments on the  draft permit or participated in the public hearing, if one has been  held, may petition the Environmental Appeals Board to review any  condition of the permit. Review of the permit decision will be governed  by the regulations for review of PSD permits contained in 40 CFR part  124.  [64 FR 65663, Nov. 23, 1999]</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 23879, Apr. 29, 2011, Sec. 49.22 was  to be redesignated as Sec. 49.5511, effective July 28, 2011. However,  this action could not be done as Sec. 49.5511 was already in existence  at that time.    Secs. 49.23-49.50  [Reserved]</p>
