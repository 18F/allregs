                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Apparatus--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Test chamber. The test chamber shall be a steel  cabinet with inside dimensions of 32.9 cm. (12\15/16\ in.) wide, 32.9  cm. (12\15/16\ in.) deep, and 76.2 cm. (30 in.) high. It shall have a  frame which permits the suspension of the specimen holder over the  center of the base of the cabinet at such a height that the bottom of  the specimen holder is 1.7 cm. (\3/4\ in.) above the highest point of  the barrel of the gas burner specified in paragraph (c) of this section  and perpendicular to the front of the cabinet. The front of the cabinet  shall be a close fitting door with a glass insert to permit observation  of the entire test. The cabinet floor may be covered with a piece of  asbestos paper, whose length and width are approximately 2.5 cm. (1 in.)  less than the cabinet floor dimensions. The cabinet to be used in this  test method is illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed in Engineering  Drawings, Nos. 1 to 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specimen holder. The specimen holder is designed to permit  suspension of the specimen in a fixed vertical position and to prevent  curling of the specimen when the flame is applied. It shall consist of  two U-shaped 0.20 cm. (14 ga. USS) thick steel plates, 42.2 cm. (16\5/8\  in.) long, and 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide, with   aligning pins. The openings in the plates shall be 35.6 cm. (14 in.)  long and 5.1 cm. (2 in.) wide. The specimen shall be fixed between the  plates, which shall be held together with side clamps. The holder to be  used in this test method is illustrated in Figure 2 and detailed in  Engineering Drawing No. 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Burner. The burner shall be substantially the same as that  illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed in Engineering Drawing No. 6. It  shall have a tube of 1.1 cm. (0.43 in.) inside diameter. The input line  to the burner shall be equipped with a needle valve. It shall have a  variable orifice to adjust the height of the flame. The barrel of the  burner shall be at an angle of 25[deg] from the vertical. The burner  shall be equipped with an adjustable stop collar so that it may be  positioned quickly under the test specimen. The burner shall be  connected to the gas source by rubber or other flexible tubing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gas supply system. There shall be a pressure regulator to  furnish gas to the burner under a pressure of 12913mm. Hg (2\1/2\\1/4\ lbs. per sq.  in.) at the burner inlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Gas. The gas shall be at least 97 percent pure methane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Hooks and weights. Metal hooks and weights shall be used to  produce a series of loads for char length determinations. Suitable metal  hooks consist of No. 19 gauge steel wire, or equivalent, made from 7.6  cm. (3 in.) lengths of the wire, bent 1.3 cm. (0.5 in.) from one end to  a 45[deg] angle hook. The longer end of the wire is fastened around the  neck of the weight to be used and the other in the lower end of each  burned specimen to one side of the burned area. The requisite loads are  given in table 1.

An air-tight and moisture-tight desiccating chamber  shall be used for cooling mounted specimens after drying. Anhydrous  silica gel shall be used as the desiccant in the desicating chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Hood. A hood or other suitable enclosure shall be used to  provide a draft-free environment surrounding the test chamber. This  enclosure shall have a fan or other suitable means for exhausting smoke  and/or toxic gases produced by testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specimens and sampling--General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test criteria of Sec.  1615.3(b) shall be used in conjunction with the following fabric and  garment sampling plan, or any other approved by the Consumer Product  Safety Commission that provides at least the equivalent level of fire  safety to the consumer. Alternate sampling plans submitted for approval  shall have operating characteristics such that the probability of Unit  acceptance at any percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding  probability of Unit acceptance of the following sampling plan in the  region of the latter's operating characteristic curves that lies between  5 and 95 percent acceptance probability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric  may be included in a single Fabric or Garment Production Unit, provided  such colors or print patterns demonstrate char lengths that are not  significantly different from each other as determined by previous  testing of at least three samples from each color or print pattern to be  included in the Unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Garments with different trim and findings may be included in a  single Garment Production Unit providing the other garment  characteristics are identical except for size, color, and print pattern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this section is met on  subsequent Fabric Production Units if results of testing an initial  Fabric Production Unit demonstrate acceptability according to the  requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, Normal Sampling, both  before and after the appropriate laundering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the fabric has been shown to meet the laundering requirement,  paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the garments produced from that fabric  are not required to be laundered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each Sample (five specimens) for all Fabric Sampling shall be  selected so that two specimens are in one fabric direction (machine or  cross-machine) and three specimens are in the other fabric direction  except for the additional Sample selected after a failure, in which  case, all five specimens shall be selected in the same fabric direction  in which the specimen failure occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Fabric Samples may be selected from fabric as outlined in  paragraph (c) of this section entitled Fabric Sampling, or, for  verification purposes, from randomly selected garments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Multilayer fabrics shall be tested with a hem of approximately  2.5 cm. (1 in.) sewn at the bottom edge of the specimen with a suitable  thread and   stitch. The specimen shall include each of the components over its  entire length. Garments manufactured from multilayer fabrics shall be  tested with the edge finish at the bottom edge of the specimen which is  used in the garment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specimens and Sampling--Fabric Sampling. A Fabric Production  Unit (Unit) is either accepted or rejected in accordance with the  following plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, reject the Unit.  If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 10 selected  specimens fail, the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, .3(b)(2), reject the  Unit. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens,  fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), select five  additional specimens from the same end of the Piece in which the failure  occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the  specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test  criteria, accept the Unit. If this additional Sample fails any part of  the test criteria, reject the Unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduced Sampling. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The level of sampling required for fabric  acceptance may be reduced provided the preceding 15 Units of the fabric  have all been accepted using the Normal Sampling plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Reduced Sampling plan shall be the same as for Normal  Sampling except that the quantity of fabric in the Unit may be increased  to 10,000 linear yards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Select and test two Samples in the same manner as in Normal  Sampling. Accept or reject the Unit on the same basis as with Normal  Sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reduced Sampling shall be discontinued and Normal Sampling  resumed if a Unit is rejected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tightened Sampling. The level of sampling required for  acceptance shall be increased when a Unit is rejected under the Normal  Sampling plan. The Tightened Sampling shall be the same as Normal  Sampling except that one additional Sample shall be selected and cut  from a middle Piece in the Unit. If the Unit is made up of less than two  pieces, the Unit shall be divided into at least two Pieces. The division  shall be such that the Pieces produced by the division shall not be  smaller than 100 linear yards or greater than 2,500 linear yards. If the  unit is made up of two Pieces, the additional Sample shall be selected  from the interior end of one of the Pieces. Test the three selected  Samples. If all three selected Samples meet all the test criteria of  Sec. 1615.3(b), accept the unit. If one or more of the three selected  Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, Sec.  1615.3(b)(1), reject the Unit. If two or more of the individual  specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char  length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), reject the unit. If only one individual  specimen, of the 15 selected Specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char  length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the  same end of the same piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be  taken in the fabric direction in which the Specimen failure occurred. If  this additional Sample passes all the test criteria, accept the Unit. If  this additional Sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the  Unit. Tightened Sampling may be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed  after five consecutive Units have all been accepted using Tightened  Sampling. If Tightened Sampling remains in effect for 15 consecutive  units, production of the specific fabric in Tightened Sampling must be  discontinued until that part of the process or component which is  causing failure has been identified and the quality of the end product  has been improved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disposition of Rejected Units. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Piece or Pieces which  have failed and resulted in the initial rejection of the Unit may not be  retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined  in Sec. 1615.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability  characteristics and subsequent retesting in accordance with the  procedures in Tightened Sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The remainder of a rejected Unit, after removing the Piece or  Pieces the failure of which resulted in Unit rejection, may be accepted  if the following test plan is successfully concluded at all required  locations. The required locations are those adjacent to each such failed  Piece. (Required locations exist on both sides of the ``Middle Piece''  tested in Tightened Sampling if failure of that Piece resulted in Unit  rejection.) Failure of a Piece shall be deemed to have resulted in Unit  rejection if Unit rejection occurred and a Sample or specimen from the  Piece failed any test criterion of Sec. 1615.3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Unit should contain at least 15 Pieces for disposition  testing after removing the failing Pieces. If necessary for this  purpose, the Unit shall be demarcated into at least 15 approximately  equal length Pieces unless such division results in Pieces shorter than  100 linear yards. In this latter case, the Unit shall be demarcated into  roughly equal length Pieces of approximately 100 linear yards each. If  such a division results in five Pieces or less in the Unit for each  failing Piece after removing the failing Pieces, only the individual  Piece retest procedure (described subsequently) may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Select and cut a Sample from each end of each adjoining Piece  beginning adjacent to the Piece which failed. Test the two Samples from  the Piece. If both Samples meet all the test criteria of Sec.  1615.3(b), the Piece is acceptable. If one or both of the two selected  Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, Sec.  1615.3(b)(1), the Piece is unacceptable. If two or more of the  individual Specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm.  (10 in.) char length Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), the Piece is unacceptable. If  only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the  25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), select five  additional specimens from the same end of the Piece in which the failure  occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the  specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test  criteria, the Piece is acceptable. If this additional Sample fails any  part of the test criteria, the Piece is unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Continue testing adjoining Pieces until a Piece has been found  acceptable. Then continue testing adjoining Pieces until three  successive adjoining Pieces, not including the first acceptable Piece,  have been found acceptable or until five such Pieces not including the  first acceptable Piece, have been tested, whichever occurs sooner.  Unless three successive adjoining Pieces have been found acceptable  among five such Pieces, testing shall be stopped and the entire Unit  rejected without further testing. If three successive Pieces have been  found acceptable among five such Pieces, accept the three successive  acceptable Pieces and the remaining Pieces in the Unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Alternatively, individual Pieces from a rejected Unit  containing three or more Pieces may be tested and accepted or rejected  on a Piece-by-Piece basis according to the following plan, after  removing the Piece or Pieces, the failure of which resulted in Unit  rejection. Select four Samples (two from each end) from the Piece. Test  the four selected Samples. If all four Samples meet all the Test  Criteria of Sec. 1615.3(b), accept the Piece. If one or more of the  Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, Sec.  1615.3(b)(1), reject the Piece. If two or more of the individual  Specimens from the 20 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.)  char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Piece. If only one  individual specimen, from the 20 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm.  (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), select two additional Samples  from the same end of the Piece in which the failure occurred. If these  additional two Samples meet all the Test Criteria of Sec. 1615.3(b),  accept the Piece. If one or both of the two additional Samples fail any  part of the Test Criteria, reject the Piece.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The Pieces of a Unit rejected after retesting may not be  retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined  in Sec. 1615.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability  characteristics, and subsequent retesting in accordance with the  procedures set forth in Tightened Sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records. Records of all Unit sizes, test results, and the  disposition of rejected Pieces and Units must be maintained by the  manufacturer upon the effective date of this Standard. Rules and  regulations may be established by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Specimens and Sampling--Garment Sampling. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The garment  sampling plan is made up of two parts: (A) Prototype Testing and (B)  Production Testing. Prior to production, prototypes must be tested to  assure that the design characteristics of the garments are acceptable.  Garment Production Units (Units) are then accepted or rejected on an  individual Unit basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Edge finishes such as hems and binding are excluded from  testing except that when trim is used on an edge the trim must be  subjected to prototype testing. Seams attaching findings are excluded  from testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prototype Testing. Preproduction prototypes of a garment style  or type shall be tested to assure that satisfactory garment  specifications in terms of flammability are set up prior to production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seams. Make three Samples (15 specimens) using the longest seam  type and three Samples using each other seam type 10 inches or longer  that is to be included in the garment. Prior to testing, assign each  specimen to one of the three Samples. Test each set of three Samples and  accept or reject each seam design in accordance with the following plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If all three Samples meet all the test criteria of Sec.  1615.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three Samples  fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, Sec.  1615.3(b)(1), reject the seam design. If three or more of the individual  Specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char  length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), reject the seam design. If only one of the  individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fails the 25.4 cm.  (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), accept the seam design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If two of the individual specimens from the 15 selected  specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2),  select three more Samples (15 specimens) and retest. If all three  additional Samples meet all the test criteria of Sec. 1615.3(b) accept  the seam design. If one or more of the three additional Samples fail the  17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, Sec. 1615.3(b)(1),  reject the seam design. If two or more of the individual specimens from  the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, Sec.  1615.3(b)(2) reject the seam design. If only one of the individual  specimens from the 15 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.)  char length Sec. 1615.3(b)(2) accept the seam design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trim. (A)(1) Make three samples (15 specimens) from each type  of trim to be included in the garment. For trim used only in a  horizontal configuration on the garment, specimens shall be prepared by  sewing or attaching the trim horizontally to the bottom edge of an  appropriate section of untrimmed fabric. Sleeve and neckline trim may  not be tested in this manner. Where more than one row of trim is used on  the garment, specimens shall be prepared with the same configuration  (same number of rows and spacing between rows up to the limit of the  specimen size) as the garment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For trim used in other than a horizontal configuration,  specimens shall be prepared by sewing or attaching the trim to the  center of the vertical axis of an appropriate section of untrimmed  fabric, beginning the sewing or attachment at the lower edge of each  specimen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For either configuration, the sewing or attachment shall be made  in the manner in which the trim is attached in the garment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Sewing or otherwise attaching the trim shall be done with  thread or fastening material of the same composition and size to be used  for this purpose in the garment and using the same stitching or  seamtype. Trim used in the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or  fastened the entire width (smaller dimension) of the specimen. Trim used  in other than the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or fastened the  entire length (longer dimension) of the specimen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three  samples. Test the sets of three samples and accept or reject the type of  trim and design on   the same basis as seam design. A type of trim and design accepted when  tested in a vertical configuration may be used in a horizontal  configuration without further testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Production Testing. A Unit is either accepted or rejected  according to the following plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> From each Unit select at random sufficient garments and cut  three Samples (15 specimens) from the longest seam type. No more than  five specimens may be cut from a single garment. Prior to testing,  assign each specimen to one of the three Samples. All specimens cut from  a single garment must be included in the same Sample. Test the three  selected Samples. If all three Samples meet all the test criteria of  Sec. 1615.3(b), accept the Unit. If one or more of the three Samples  fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, Sec.  1615.3(b)(1), reject the Unit. If four or more of the individual  specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm (10 in.)  char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), reject the Unit. If three or less of  the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4  cm. (10 in.) char length, Sec. 1615.3(b)(2), accept the Unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> If the garment under test does not have a 10-inch seam in the  largest size in which it is produced, the following selection and  testing procedure shall be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Select and cut specimens 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide by the maximum  available seam length, with the seam in the center of the specimen and  extending the entire specimen length. Cut three Samples (15 specimens).  These specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom  edge is even with the bottom of the specimen holder and the seam begins  in the center of the bottom edge. Prior to testing, assign each specimen  to one of the three Samples. All specimens cut from a single garment  must be included in the same Sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test the three Samples. If all three Samples pass the 17.8 cm.  (7 in.) average char length criterion, Sec. 1615.3(b)(1), and if three  or less individual specimens fail by charring the entire specimen  length, accept the Unit. If the Unit is not accepted in the above test,  three Samples (15 specimens) of the longest seam type shall be made  using fabric and thread from production inventory and sewn on production  machines by production operators. The individual fabric sections prior  to sewing must be no larger than 20.3 x 63.3 cm. (8 in. x 25 in.) and  must be selected from more than one area of the base fabric. Test the  three prepared Samples. Accept or reject the Unit as described  previously in this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disposition of Rejected Units. Rejected Units shall not be  retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined  in Sec. 1615.1(a), except after reworking to improve the flammability  characteristics and subsequent retesting in accordance with the  procedures set forth in garment production testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records. Records of all Unit sizes, test results, and the  disposition of rejected Units must be maintained by the manufacturer  upon the effective date of this standard. Rules and regulations may be  established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> of this section shall be deemed  not to conform to this Standard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission  may publish such plans in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Mounting and conditioning of specimens. (1) The specimens shall  be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge of each specimen  is even with the bottom of the specimen holder. Mount the specimen in as  close to a flat configuration as possible. The sides of the specimen  holder shall cover 1.9 cm. (\3/4\ in.) of the specimen width along each  long edge of the specimen, and thus shall expose 5.1 cm. (2 in.) of the  specimen width. The sides of the specimen holder shall be clamped with a  sufficient number of clamps or shall be   taped to prevent the specimen from being displaced during handling and  testing. The specimens may be taped in the holders if the clamps fail to  hold them. Place the mounted specimens in the drying oven in a manner  that will permit free circulation of air at 105 [deg]C. (221 [deg]F.)  around them for 30 minutes. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air dry  at laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory  preconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776-67, ``Conditioning  Textiles and Textile Products for Testing.'' (``1970 Book of ASTM  Standards,'' part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and  Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remove the mounted specimens from the oven and place them in the  desiccator for 30 minutes to cool. No more than five specimens shall be  placed in a desiccator at one time. Specimens shall remain in the  desiccator no more than 60 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Burner adjustment. With the hood fan turned off,  use the needle valve to adjust the flame height of the burner to 3.8 cm.  (1\1/2\ in.) above the highest point of the barrel of the burner. A  suitable height indicator is shown in Engineering Drawing No. 6 and  Figure 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specimen Burning and Evaluation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One at a time, the mounted  specimens shall be removed from the desiccator and suspended in the  cabinet for testing. The cabinet door shall be closed and the burner  flame impinged on the bottom edge of the specimen for 3.00.2 seconds. Flame impingement is accomplished by moving  the burner under the specimen for this length of time, and then removing  it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When afterglow has ceased, remove the specimen from the cabinet  and holder, and place it on a clean flat surface. Fold the specimen  lengthwise along a line through the highest peak of the charred or  melted area; crease the specimen firmly by hand. Unfold the specimen and  insert the hook with the correct weight as shown in table 1 in the  specimen on one side of the charred area 6.4 mm. (\1/4\ in.) from the  lower edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tear the specimen by grasping the other lower corner of the  fabric and gently raising the specimen and weight clear of the  supporting surface. \5\ Measure the char length as the distance from the  end of the tear to the edge of the specimen exposed to the flame. After  testing each specimen, vent the hood and cabinet to remove the smoke  and/or toxic gases. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ A figure showing how this is done is given in AATCC 34-1969,  Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and  Colorists, vol. 46, 1970, published by AATCC, Post Office Box 12215,  Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Report. Report the value of char length, in centimeters  (inches), for each specimen, as well as the average char length for each  set of five specimens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Laundering. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The procedures described in sections 1615.4(b)  through (g) shall be carried out on finished items (as produced or after  one washing and drying) and after they have been washed and dried 50  times in accordance with sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, and 8.3.1(A) of AATCC  Test Method 124-1996 ``Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home  Laundering,'' Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile  Chemists and Colorists, vol. 73, 1997, which is incorporated by  reference.

This incorporation by  reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in  accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Items which do not  withstand 50 launderings shall be tested at the end of their useful  service life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Washing shall be performed in accordance with sections 8.2.2  and 8.2.3 of AATCC Test Method 124-1996, using wash temperature V  (60[deg] 3 [deg]C, 140[deg] 5 [deg]F) specified in Table II of that method, and the  water level, agitator speed, washing time, spin speed and final spin  cycle specified for ``Normal/Cotton Sturdy'' in Table III. A maximum   washer load shall be 3.64 Kg (8 pounds) and may consist of any  combination of test samples and dummy pieces. Drying shall be performed  in accordance with section 8.3.1(A) of that test method, Tumble Dry,  using the exhaust temperature (66[deg] 5 [deg]C,  150[deg] 10 [deg]F) and cool down time of 10  minutes specified in the ``Durable Press'' conditions of Table IV.  Alternatively, a different number of times under another washing and  drying procedure may be specified and used, if that procedure has  previously been found to be equivalent by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission. Such laundering is not required of items which are not  intended to be laundered, as determined by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Items which are not susceptible to being laundered and are  labeled ``dry-clean only'' shall be drycleaned by a procedure which has  previously been found to be acceptable by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the purpose of the issuance of a guarantee under section 8  of the act, finished sleepwear garments to be tested according to  paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section need not be laundered or  drycleaned provided all fabrics used in making the garments (except  trim) have been guaranteed by the fabric producer to be acceptable when  tested according to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
