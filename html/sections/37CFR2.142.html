If the brief is not filed within the time allowed, the appeal may be dismissed. The examiner shall, within sixty days after the brief of appellant is sent to the examiner, file with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board a written brief answering the brief of appellant and shall mail a copy of the brief to the appellant. The appellant may file a reply brief within twenty days from the date of mailing of the brief of the examiner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The brief of appellant shall be filed within sixty days from the date of appeal.

The appellant may file a reply brief within twenty days from the date of mailing of the brief of the examiner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Briefs must be submitted in written form and must meet the requirements prescribed in Sec.  2.126. Each brief shall contain an alphabetical index of cited cases. Without prior leave of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, a brief shall not exceed twenty-five pages in length in its entirety, including the table of contents, index of cases, description of the record, statement of the issues, recitation of the facts, argument, and summary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All requirements made by the examiner and not the subject of appeal shall be complied with prior to the filing of an appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The record in the application should be complete prior to the filing of an appeal. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will ordinarily not consider additional evidence filed with the Board by the appellant or by the examiner after the appeal is filed. After an appeal is filed, if the appellant or the examiner desires to introduce additional evidence, the appellant or the examiner may request the Board to suspend the appeal and to remand the application for further examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> If the appellant desires an oral hearing, a request should be made by a separate notice filed not later than ten days after the due date for a reply brief. Oral argument will be heard by at least three Administrative Trademark Judges of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at the time specified in the notice of hearing, which may be reset if the Board is prevented from hearing the argument at the specified time or, so far as is convenient and proper, to meet the wish of the appellant or the appellant's attorney or other authorized representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the appellant desires an oral hearing, a request should be made by a separate notice filed not later than ten days after the due date for a reply brief.

designated by the supervisory attorney thereof, shall present an oral argument. If no request for an oral hearing is made by the appellant, the appeal will be decided on the record and briefs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Oral argument will be limited to twenty minutes by the appellant and ten minutes by the examiner. The appellant may reserve part of the time allowed for oral argument to present a rebuttal argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> If, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, it appears to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that an issue not previously raised may render the mark of the appellant unregistrable, the Board may suspend the appeal and remand the application to the examiner for further examination to be completed within thirty days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, it appears to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that an issue not previously raised may render the mark of the appellant unregistrable, the Board may suspend the appeal and remand the application to the examiner for further examination to be completed within thirty days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the further examination does not result in an additional ground for refusal of registration, the examiner shall promptly return the application to the Board, for resumption of the appeal, with a written statement that further examination did not result in an additional ground for refusal of registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the further examination does result in an additional ground for refusal of registration, the examiner and appellant shall proceed as provided by Sec. Sec.  2.61, 2.62, and 2.63. If the ground for refusal is made final, the examiner shall return the application to the Board, which shall thereupon issue an order allowing the appellant sixty days from the date of the order to file a supplemental brief limited to the additional ground for the refusal of registration. If the supplemental brief is not filed by the appellant within the time allowed, the appeal may be dismissed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the supplemental brief of the appellant is filed, the examiner shall, within sixty days after the supplemental brief of the appellant is sent to the examiner, file with the Board a written brief answering the supplemental brief of appellant and shall mail a copy of the brief to the appellant. The appellant may file a reply brief within twenty days from the date of mailing of the brief of the examiner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an oral hearing on the appeal had been requested prior to the remand of the application but not yet held, an oral hearing will be set and heard as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If an oral hearing had been held prior to the remand or had not been previously requested by the appellant, an oral hearing may be requested by the appellant by a separate notice filed not later than ten days after the due date for a reply brief on the additional ground for refusal of registration. If the appellant files a request for an oral hearing, one will be set and heard as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, it appears to the examiner that an issue not involved in the appeal may render the mark of the appellant unregistrable, the examiner may, by written request, ask the Board to suspend the appeal and to remand the application to the examiner for further examination. If the request is granted, the examiner and appellant shall proceed as provided by Sec. Sec.  2.61, 2.62, and 2.63. After the additional ground for refusal of registration has been withdrawn or made final, the examiner shall return the application to the Board, which shall resume proceedings in the appeal and take further appropriate action with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An application which has been considered and decided on appeal will not be reopened except for the entry of a disclaimer under section 6 of the Act of 1946 or upon order of the Director, but a petition to the Director to reopen an application will be considered only upon a showing of sufficient cause for consideration of any matter not already adjudicated.
