Petitions that are postmarked by a private meter will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Petitions that are postmarked, or accompanied by a receipt from a commercial carrier or U.S. Postal Service, prior to this date will be returned to the petitioner. Petitions that are delivered by hand at any time will be returned to the petitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Deadlines. The deadline for filing a petition is November 13, 2001. To meet this deadline, the petition must be postmarked, or accompanied by a receipt from a commercial carrier or U.S. Postal Service, by such date.
