The rate for service provided to a published destination point from an origin point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate from the next more distant origin point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intermediate origin points.
