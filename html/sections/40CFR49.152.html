                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For sources of regulated NSR pollutants in nonattainment areas, the definitions in Sec. 49.167 apply to the extent that they are used in this program (except for terms defined in paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For sources of regulated NSR pollutants in attainment or unclassifiable areas, the definitions in Sec. 52.21 of this chapter apply to the extent that they are used in this program (except for terms defined in paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For sources of HAP, the definitions in Sec. 63.2 of this chapter apply to the extent that they are used in this program (except for terms defined in paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following definitions also apply to this program:</p><p class="depth2">Affected emissions units means the following emissions units, as applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> For a proposed new minor source, all the emissions units.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> For a proposed modification, the new, modified and replacement emissions units involved in the modification.</p><p class="depth4">Allowable emissions means ``allowable emissions'' as defined in Sec. 52.21(b)(16) of this chapter, except that the allowable emissions for any emissions unit are calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit.</p><p class="depth4">Begin construction means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. The following preparatory activities are excluded: Engineering and design planning, geotechnical investigation (surface and subsurface explorations), clearing, grading, surveying, ordering of equipment and materials, storing of equipment or setting up temporary trailers to house construction management or staff and contractor personnel.</p><p class="depth4">Commence construction means, as applied to a new minor stationary source or minor modification at an existing stationary source subject to this subpart, that the owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> Begun on-site activities including, but not limited to, installing building supports and foundations, laying underground piping or erecting/installing permanent storage structures. The following preparatory activities are excluded: Engineering and design planning, geotechnical investigation (surface and subsurface explorations), clearing, grading, surveying, ordering of equipment and materials, storing of equipment or setting up temporary trailers to house construction management or staff and contractor personnel; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth2">Emission limitation means a requirement established by the reviewing authority that limits the quantity, rate or concentration of emissions of air pollutants on a continuous basis, including any requirement relating to the operation or maintenance of a source to assure continuous emissions reduction and any design standard, equipment standard, work practice, operational standard or pollution prevention technique.</p><p class="depth2">Enforceable as a practical matter means that an emission limitation or other standard is both legally and practicably enforceable as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> An emission limitation or other standard is legally enforceable if the reviewing authority has the right to enforce it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Practical enforceability for an emission limitation or for other standards (design standards, equipment standards, work practices, operational standards, pollution prevention techniques) in a permit for a source is achieved if the permit's provisions specify:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> A limitation or standard and the emissions units or activities at the source subject to the limitation or standard;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> The time period for the limitation or standard (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly and/or annual limits such as rolling annual limits); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> The method to determine compliance, including appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting and testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> For rules and general permits that apply to categories of sources, practical enforceability additionally requires that the provisions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> Identify the types or categories of sources that are covered by the rule or general permit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> Where coverage is optional, provide for notice to the reviewing authority of the source's election to be covered by the rule or general permit; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the enforcement consequences relevant to the rule or general permit.</p><p class="depth2">Environmental Appeals Board means the Board within the EPA described in Sec. 1.25(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, means the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> All land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent and including rights-of-way running through the reservation; \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ Under this definition, EPA treats as reservations trust lands validly set aside for the use of a tribe even if the trust lands have not been formally designated as a reservation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> All dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof and whether within or without the limits of a state; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> All Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.</p><p class="depth2">Indian governing body means the governing body of any Tribe, band or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and recognized by the United States as possessing power of self-government.</p><p class="depth2">Minor modification at a major source means a modification at a major source that does not qualify as a major modification under Sec. 49.167 or Sec. 52.21 of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2">Minor NSR threshold means any of the applicability cutoffs for this program listed in Table 1 of Sec. 49.153.</p><p class="depth2">Minor source means, for purposes of this rule, a source, not including the exempt emissions units and activities listed in Sec. 49.153(c), that has the potential to emit regulated NSR pollutants in amounts that are less than the major source thresholds in Sec. 49.167 or Sec. 52.21 of this chapter, as applicable, but equal to or greater than the minor NSR thresholds in Sec. 49.153. The potential to emit includes fugitive emissions, to the extent that they are quantifiable, only if the source belongs to one of the source categories listed in part 51, Appendix S, paragraph II.A.4(iii) or Sec. 52.21(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2">Modification means any physical or operational change at a source that would cause an increase in the allowable emissions of a minor source or an increase in the actual emissions (based on the applicable test under the major NSR program) of a major source for any regulated NSR pollutant or that would cause the emission of any regulated NSR pollutant not previously emitted. Allowable emissions of a minor source include fugitive emissions, to the extent that they are quantifiable, only if the source belongs to one of the source categories listed in part 51, Appendix S, paragraph II.A.4(iii) or Sec. 52.21(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, as applicable. The following exemptions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> A physical or operational change does not include routine maintenance, repair or replacement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> An increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate is not considered an operational change unless such change is prohibited under any permit condition that is enforceable as a practical matter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> A change in ownership at a stationary source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> The emissions units and activities listed in Sec. 49.153(c).</p><p class="depth4">Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational

limitation on the capacity of the source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is enforceable as a practical matter. Secondary emissions, as defined at Sec. 52.21(b)(18) of this chapter, do not count in determining the potential to emit of a source.</p><p class="depth4">Reviewing authority means the Administrator or may mean an Indian Tribe in cases where a Tribal agency is assisting EPA with administration of the program through a delegation.</p><p class="depth4">Synthetic minor HAP source means a source that otherwise has the potential to emit HAPs in amounts that are at or above those for major sources of HAP in Sec. 63.2 of this chapter, but that has taken a restriction so that its potential to emit is less than such amounts for major sources. Such restrictions must be enforceable as a practical matter.</p><p class="depth4">Synthetic minor source means a source that otherwise has the potential to emit regulated NSR pollutants in amounts that are at or above those for major sources in Sec. 49.167, Sec. 52.21 or Sec. 71.2 of this chapter, as applicable, but that has taken a restriction so that its potential to emit is less than such amounts for major sources. Such restrictions must be enforceable as a practical matter.</p><p class="depth4">True minor source means a source, not including the exempt emissions units and activities listed in Sec. 49.153(c), that emits or has the potential to emit regulated NSR pollutants in amounts that are less than the major source thresholds in Sec. 49.167 or Sec. 52.21 of this chapter, as applicable, but equal to or greater than the minor NSR thresholds in Sec. 49.153, without the need to take an enforceable restriction to reduce its potential to emit to such levels. That is, a true minor source is a minor source that is not a synthetic minor source. The potential to emit includes fugitive emissions, to the extent that they are quantifiable, only if the source belongs to one of the source categories listed in part 51, Appendix S, paragraph II.A.4(iii) or Sec. 52.21(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, as applicable.
