                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For requests other than those described in paragraphs (b), (c),  and (f) of this section, a FOIA office shall not require the requester  to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a  request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment for  search, review and/or before records are released to a requester) is not  an advance payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to  be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that  the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire  anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A FOIA office  may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it  receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly  charged FOIA fee assessed by any FOIA office in the agency within 30  calendar days of the billing date, a FOIA office may require the  requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest due  on the outstanding debt, before the FOIA office begins to process a new  request or continues to process a pending request or any pending remand  of an appeal. Once the outstanding bill has been paid, the FOIA office  may also require the requester to make an advance payment of the full  amount of any anticipated fee before processing the new request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where a FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a  requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid  paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide  further proof of identity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In cases in which a FOIA office requires advance payment, the  request shall be placed on hold and further work will not be completed  until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay  the advance payment within 20 working days after the date of the FOIA  office's letter, the request will be closed without further  notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When advance payment is required in order to initiate  processing, after a fee estimate has been determined, the FOIA office  will require payment before continuing to process the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged  under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and  collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records  responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule  program, the FOIA office will inform the requester of the contact  information for that source.</p>
