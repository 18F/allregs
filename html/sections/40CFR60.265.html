                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of any electric submerged arc furnace  subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain daily records  of the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Product being produced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Description of constituents of furnace charge, including the  quantity, by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time and duration of each tapping period and the identification  of material tapped (slag or product.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All furnace power input data obtained under paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (c) of this section  or all fan motor power consumption and pressure drop data obtained under  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart  shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to measure and  continuously record the furnace power input. The furnace power input may  be measured at the output or input side of the transformer. The device  must have an accuracy of 5 percent over its  operating range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart  shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that  continuously measures and records the volumetric flow rate through each  separately ducted hood of the capture system, except as provided under  paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator of an electric  submerged arc furnace that is equipped with a water cooled cover which  is designed to contain and prevent escape of the generated gas and  particulate matter shall monitor only the volumetric flow rate through  the capture system for control of emissions from the tapping station.  The owner or operator may install the monitoring device(s) in any  appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow  rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device must have  an accuracy of 10 percent over   its normal operating range and must be calibrated according to the  manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or  operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device relative  to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When performance tests are conducted under the provisions of  Sec. 60.8 of this part to demonstrate compliance with the standards  under Sec. Sec. 60.262(a) (4) and (5), the volumetric flow rate through  each separately ducted hood of the capture system must be determined  using the monitoring device required under paragraph (c) of this  section. The volumetric flow rates must be determined for furnace power  input levels at 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the  electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc  furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the volumetric  flow rate at or above the appropriate levels for that furnace power  input level determined during the most recent performance test. If  emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from  emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping  period the owner or operator shall maintain the exhaust flow rates  through the capture system over the tapping station at or above the  levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at  lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be  unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The  owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by  conducting new performance tests under Sec. 60.8 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator may as an alternative to paragraph (c) of  this section determine the volumetric flow rate through each fan of the  capture system from the fan power consumption, pressure drop across the  fan and the fan performance curve. Only data specific to the operation  of the affected electric submerged arc furnace are acceptable for  demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. The  owner or operator shall maintain on file a permanent record of the fan  performance curve (prepared for a specific temperature) and shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to  continuously measure and record the power consumption of the fan motor  (measured in kilowatts), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to  continuously measure and record the pressure drop across the fan. The  fan power consumption and pressure drop measurements must be  synchronized to allow real time comparisions of the data. The monitoring  devices must have an accuracy of 5 percent over  their normal operating ranges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system  must be determined from the fan power consumption, fan pressure drop,  and fan performance curve specified under paragraph (e) of this section,  during any performance test required under Sec. 60.8 to demonstrate  compliance with the standards under Sec. Sec. 60.262(a)(4) and (5). The  owner or operator shall determine the volumetric flow rate at a  representative temperature for furnace power input levels of 50 and 100  percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc  furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated,  the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan  pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or  above the levels established during the most recent performance test for  that furnace power input level. If emissions due to tapping are captured  and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc  furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain  the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the  volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the  most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be  considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and  maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request  that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance  tests under Sec. 60.8. The Administrator may require the owner or  operator to verify the fan performance curve by monitoring necessary fan  operating parameters and determining the gas volume   moved relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All monitoring devices required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of  this section are to be checked for calibration annually in accordance  with the procedures under Sec. 60.13(b).</p>
