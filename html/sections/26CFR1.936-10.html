This paragraph (c)(7)(i) applies to the refinancing of costs incurred with respect to investments that, at the time the costs were first incurred, were either qualified investments in a qualified Caribbean Basin country or were investments by a qualified recipient in active business assets or a development project in a qualified Caribbean Basin country.
