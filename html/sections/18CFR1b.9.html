                            <p class="depth0">All information and documents obtained during the course of an  investigation, whether or not obtained pursuant to subpoena, and all  investigative proceedings shall be treated as nonpublic by the  Commission and its staff except to the extent that (a) the Commission  directs or authorizes the public disclosure of the investigation; (b)  the information or documents are made a matter of public record during  the course of an adjudicatory proceeding; or (c) disclosure is required  by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Procedures by which  persons submitting information to the Commission during the course of an  investigation may specifically seek confidential treatment of  information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act disclosure are  set forth in 18 CFR part 3b and Sec. 1b.20. A request for confidential  treatment of information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act  disclosure shall not, however, prevent disclosure for law enforcement   purposes or when disclosure is otherwise found appropriate in the public  interest and permitted by law.</p>
