                            <p class="depth0">This part sets forth standard reporting and recordkeeping requirements and license application and other procedures governing transactions regulated pursuant to other parts codified in this chapter, as well as to economic sanctions programs for which implementation and administration are delegated to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Substantive prohibitions and policies particular to each economic sanctions program are not contained in this part but are set forth in the particular part of this chapter dedicated to that program, or, in the case of economic sanctions programs not yet implemented in regulations, in the applicable executive order or other authority. License application procedures and reporting requirements set forth in this part govern transactions undertaken pursuant to general or specific licenses. The criteria for general and specific licenses pertaining to a particular economic sanctions program are set forth in subpart E of the individual parts in this chapter. Statements of licensing policy contained in subpart E of the individual parts in this chapter, however, may contain additional information collection provisions that require production of specified documentation unique to a given general license or statement of licensing policy.
