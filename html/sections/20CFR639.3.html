                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``employer'' means any business  enterprise that employs--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 100 or more employees, including part-time employees, who in  the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week, exclusive of hours of  overtime.  Workers on temporary layoff or on leave who have a reasonable  expectation of recall are counted as employees. An employee has a  ``reasonable expectation of recall'' when he/she understands, through  notification or through industry practice, that his/her employment with  the employer has been temporarily interrupted and that he/she will be  recalled to the same or to a similar job. The term ``employer'' includes  non-profit organizations of the requisite size. Regular Federal, State,  local and federally recognized Indian tribal governments are not  covered. However, the term ``employer'' includes public and quasi-public  entities which engage in business (i.e., take part in a commercial or  industrial enterprise, supply a service or good on a mercantile basis,  or provide independent management of public assets, raising revenue and  making desired investments), and which are separately organized from the  regular government, which have their own governing bodies and which have  independent authority to manage their personnel and assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under existing legal rules, independent contractors and  subsidiaries which are wholly or partially owned by a parent company are  treated as separate employers or as a part of the parent or contracting  company depending upon the degree of their independence from the parent.  Some of the factors to be considered in making this determination are  (i) common ownership, (ii) common directors and/or officers, (iii) de  facto exercise of control, (iv) unity of personnel policies emanating  from a common source, and (v) the dependency of operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt from  notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted as employees for  purposes of determining coverage as an employer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employer may have one or more sites of employment under  common ownership or control. An example would be a major auto maker  which has dozens of automobile plants throughout the country. Each plant  would be considered a site of employment, but there is only one  ``employer'', the auto maker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plant closing. The term ``plant closing'' means the permanent or  temporary shutdown of a ``single site of   employment'', or one or more ``facilities or operating units'' within a  single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an ``employment  loss'' during any 30-day period at the single site of employment for 50  or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. An employment  action that results in the effective cessation of production or the work  performed by a unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A  ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only if there are  a sufficient number of terminations, layoffs exceeding 6 months, or  reductions in hours of work as specified under the definition of  ``employment loss.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mass layoff. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``mass layoff'' means a reduction in  force which first, is not the result of a plant closing, and second,  results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during  any 30-day period for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 33 percent of the active employees, excluding part-time  employees, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 50 employees, excluding part-time employees.  Where 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) are  affected, the 33% requirement does not apply, and notice is required if  the other criteria are met. Plant closings involve employment loss which  results from the shutdown of one or more distinct units within a single  site or the entire site. A mass layoff involves employment loss,  regardless of whether one or more units are shut down at the site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt from  notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted as employees for  purposes of determining coverage as a plant closing or mass layoff. For  example, if an employer closes a temporary project on which 10 permanent  and 40 temporary workers are employed, a covered plant closing has  occurred although only 10 workers are entitled to notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Representative. The term ``representative'' means an exclusive  representative of employees within the meaning of section 9(a) or 8(f)  of the National Labor Relations Act or section 2 of the Railway Labor  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Affected employees. The term ``affected employees'' means  employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an employment  loss as a consequence of a proposed plant closing or mass layoff by  their employer. This includes individually identifiable employees who  will likely lose their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors,  to the extent that such individual workers reasonably can be identified  at the time notice is required to be given. The term ``affected  employees'' includes managerial and supervisory employees, but does not  include business partners. Consultant or contract employees who have a  separate employment relationship with another employer and are paid by  that other employer, or who are self-employed, are not ``affected  employees'' of the business to which they are assigned. In addition, for  purposes of determining whether coverage thresholds are met, either  incumbent workers in jobs being eliminated or, if known 60 days in  advance, the actual employees who suffer an employment loss may be  counted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Employment loss. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``employment loss'' means (i) an  employment termination, other than a discharge for cause, voluntary  departure, or retirement, (ii) a layoff exceeding 6 months, or (iii) a  reduction in hours of work of individual employees of more than 50%  during each month of any 6-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a termination or a layoff (see paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and  (ii) of this section) is involved, an employment loss does not occur  when an employee is reassigned or transferred to employer-sponsored  programs, such as retraining or job search activities, as long as the  reassignment does not constitute a constructive discharge or other  involuntary termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employee is not considered to have experienced an employment  loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the relocation or  consolidation of part or all of the employer's business and, prior to  the closing or layoff--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer offers to transfer the employee to a different site  of employment within a reasonable commuting distance with no more than a  6-month break in employment, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer offers to transfer the employee to any other site  of employment regardless of distance with   no more than a 6-month break in employment, and the employee accepts  within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or layoff, whichever is  later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, means  that some definable business, whether customer orders, product lines, or  operations, is transferred to a different site of employment and that  transfer results in a plant closing or mass layoff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unit of local government. The term ``unit of local government''  means any general purpose political subdivision of a State, which has  the power to levy taxes and spend funds and which also has general  corporate and police powers. When a covered employment site is located  in more than one unit of local government, the employer must give notice  to the unit to which it determines it directly paid the highest taxes  for the year preceding the year for which the determination is made. All  local taxes directly paid to the local government should be aggregated  for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Part-time employee. The term ``part-time'' employee means an  employee who is employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week  or who has been employed for fewer than 6 of the 12 months preceding the  date on which notice is required, including workers who work full-time.  This term may include workers who would traditionally be understood as  ``seasonal'' employees. The period to be used for calculating whether a  worker has worked ``an average of fewer than 20 hours per week'' is the  shorter of the actual time the worker has been employed or the most  recent 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Single site of employment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A single site of employment can  refer to either a single location or a group of contiguous locations.  Groups of structures which form a campus or industrial park, or separate  facilities across the street from one another, may be considered a  single site of employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There may be several single sites of employment within a single  building, such as an office building, if separate employers conduct  activities within such a building. For example, an office building  housing 50 different businesses will contain 50 single sites of  employment. The offices of each employer will be its single site of  employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Separate buildings or areas which are not directly connected or  in immediate proximity may be considered a single site of employment if  they are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose,  and share the same staff and equipment. An example is an employer who  manages a number of warehouses in an area but who regularly shifts or  rotates the same employees from one building to another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-contiguous sites in the same geographic area which do not  share the same staff or operational purpose should not be considered a  single site. For example, assembly plants which are located on opposite  sides of a town and which are managed by a single employer are separate  sites if they employ different workers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contiguous buildings owned by the same employer which have  separate management, produce different products, and have separate  workforces are considered separate single sites of employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For workers whose primary duties require travel from point to  point, who are outstationed, or whose primary duties involve work  outside any of the employer's regular employment sites (e.g., railroad  workers, bus drivers, salespersons), the single site of employment to  which they are assigned as their home base, from which their work is  assigned, or to which they report will be the single site in which they  are covered for WARN purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Foreign sites of employment are not covered under WARN. U.S.  workers at such sites are counted to determine whether an employer is  covered as an employer under Sec. 639.3(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term ``single site of employment'' may also apply to truly  unusual organizational situations where the above criteria do not  reasonably apply. The application of this definition with the intent to  evade the purpose of the Act to provide notice is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Facility or operating unit. The term ``facility'' refers to a  building or buildings. The term ``operating unit'' refers to an  organizationally or operationally distinct product, operation, or  specific   work function within or across facilities at the single site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> State dislocated worker unit. The term ``State dislocated worker  unit'' means a unit designated or created in each State by the Governor  under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act, as amended by  EDWAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> State. For the purpose of WARN, the term ``State'' includes the  50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
