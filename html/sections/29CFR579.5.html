                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The administrative determination of the amount of the civil  penalty for each employee who was the subject of a violation of section  12 or section 13(c) of the Act relating to child labor or of any  regulation under those sections will be based on the available evidence  of the violation or violations and will take into consideration the size  of the business of the person charged and the gravity of the violations  as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. The  provisions of section 16(e)(1)(A)(ii) of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  regarding the assessment of civil penalties not to exceed $50,000 with  regard to each violation that causes the death or serious injury of any  employee under the age of 18 years, apply only to those violations that  occur on or after May 21, 2008.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the amount of such penalty there shall be  considered the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the  business of the person charged with the violation or violations, taking  into account the number of employees employed by that person (and if the  employment is in agriculture, the man-days of hired farm   labor used in pertinent calendar quarters), dollar volume of sales or  business done, amount of capital investment and financial resources, and  such other information as may be available relative to the size of the  business of such person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining the amount of such penalty there shall be  considered the appropriateness of such penalty to the gravity of the  violation or violations, taking into account, among other things, any  history of prior violations; any evidence of willfulness or failure to  take reasonable precautions to avoid violations; the number of minors  illegally employed; the age of the minors so employed and records of the  required proof of age; the occupations in which the minors were so  employed; exposure of such minors to hazards and any resultant injury to  such minors; the duration of such illegal employment; and, as  appropriate, the hours of the day in which it occurred and whether such  employment was during or outside school hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Based on all the evidence available, including the investigation  history of the person so charged and the degree of willfulness involved  in the violation, it shall further be determined, where appropriate,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the evidence shows that the violation is ``de minimis''  and that the person so charged has given credible assurance of future  compliance, and whether a civil penalty in the circumstances is  necessary to achieve the objectives of the Act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the evidence shows that the person so charged had no  previous history of child labor violations, that the violations  themselves involved no intentional or heedless exposure of any minor to  any obvious hazard or detriment to health or well-being and were  inadvertent, and that the person so charged has given credible assurance  of future compliance, and whether a civil penalty in the circumstances  is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An administrative determination of the amount of the civil money  penalty for a particular violation or particular violations of section  12 or section 13(c) relating to child labor or any regulation issued  under those sections shall become final 15 days after receipt of the  notice of penalty by certified mail by the person so charged unless such  person has, pursuant to Sec. 580.6 filed with the Secretary an  exception to the determination that the violation or violations for  which the penalty is imposed occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A determination of the penalty made in an administrative  proceeding after opportunity for hearing as provided in section 16(e) of  the Act and pursuant to Part 580 of this chapter shall be final.
