                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requester may apply for expedited processing when submitting an initial request for records. Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, CIGIE will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, CIGIE will process the request as soon as practicable. If CIGIE denies a request for expedited processing, CIGIE will act expeditiously on any appeal respecting that decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request or appeal will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment when CIGIE determines that the requester has established one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest raising possible questions about the Federal Government's integrity which affects public confidence; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A substantial humanitarian need or interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must include a written statement that the requester has certified to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge, explaining in detail the reasons for requesting expedited processing. CIGIE will not consider the request for expedited processing to have been received unless accompanied by such a certified statement, and CIGIE is under no obligation to consider the request for expedited processing until it receives a certified statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> These procedures apply to requests for expedited processing of administrative appeals.</p>
