Since the FCRA provides that opt-out elections can expire in a period of no less than five years, an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer must provide a renewal notice to the consumer after such time in order to allow its affiliates to make solicitations.

Sec. 162.6 through 162.8 of this subpart, and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to renew the opt-out election, and the consumer does not renew the opt out; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An exception in Sec. 162.3(c) of this subpart applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renewal period. Each opt-out renewal must be effective for a period of at least five years as provided in Sec. 162.4(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affiliates who may provide the renewal notice. The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By the affiliate that provided the previous opt-out notice, or its successor; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As part of a joint renewal notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, or their successors, that jointly provided the previous opt-out notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of renewal or extension notice. The contents of the renewal notice must include all of the same contents of the initial notices, but also must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement that the consumer previously elected to limit the use of certain information to make solicitations to the consumer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the consumer may elect to renew the consumer's previous election; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If applicable, a statement that the consumer's election to renew will apply for a specified period of time stated in the notice and that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of renewal notice. Renewal notices must be provided in a reasonable period of time before the expiration of the opt-out election period or any time after the expiration of the opt-out period, but before solicitations that would have been prohibited by the expired opt-out election are made to the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No effect on opt-out period. An opt-out period may not be shortened by

sending a renewal notice to the consumer before the expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt-out election.
