(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec.  17.1000: In cases where a patient is admitted for inpatient care, health care providers furnishing emergency treatment who believe they may have a basis for filing a claim with VA for payment under 38 U.S.C. 1725 should contact VA within 48-hours after admission for emergency treatment. Such contact is not a condition of VA payment. However, the contact will assist the provider in understanding the conditions for payment. The contact may also assist the provider in planning for transfer of the veteran after stabilization.
