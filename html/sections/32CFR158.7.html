                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DoD contracts requiring the deployment of CAAF shall include medical and dental fitness requirements as specified in this section. Under the terms and conditions of their contracts, defense contractors shall provide personnel who meet such medical and dental requirements as specified in their contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The geographic CCDR will establish theater-specific medical qualifications. When exceptions to these standards are requested through the contracting officer, the geographic CCDR will establish a process for reviewing such exceptions and ensuring that a mechanism is in place to track and archive all approved and denied waivers, including the medical condition requiring the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The geographic CCDR shall also ensure that processes and procedures are in place to remove contractor personnel in theater who are not medically qualified, once so identified by a healthcare provider. The geographic CCDR shall ensure appropriate language regarding procedures and criteria for requiring removal of contractor personnel identified as no longer medically qualified is developed, is posted on the CCDR OCS Web site, and also ensure contracting officers incorporate the same into all contracts for performance in the AOR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unless otherwise stated in the contract, all pre-, during-, and post-deployment medical evaluations and treatment are the responsibility of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Medical and Dental Evaluations. (1) All CAAF deploying in support of a contingency operation must be medically, dentally, and psychologically fit

for deployment as stated in DoD Directive 6200.04 (see http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/ 620004p.pdf). Fitness specifically includes the ability to accomplish the tasks and duties unique to a particular operation and the ability to tolerate the environmental and operational conditions of the deployed location. Under the terms and conditions of their contracts, defense contractors will provide medically, dentally, and psychologically fit contingency contractor personnel to perform contracted duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All CAAF deploying in support of a contingency operation must be medically, dentally, and psychologically fit

for deployment as stated in DoD Directive 6200.04 (see http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/ 620004p.pdf). Fitness specifically includes the ability to accomplish the tasks and duties unique to a particular operation and the ability to tolerate the environmental and operational conditions of the deployed location. Under the terms and conditions of their contracts, defense contractors will provide medically, dentally, and psychologically fit contingency contractor personnel to perform contracted duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Just as military personnel must pass a complete health evaluation, CAAF shall have a similar evaluation based on the functional requirements of the job. All CAAF must undergo a medical and dental assessment within 12 months prior to arrival at the designated deployment center or Government-authorized contractor-performed deployment processing facility. This assessment should emphasize diagnosing cardiovascular, pulmonary, orthopedic, neurologic, endocrinologic, dermatologic, psychological, visual, auditory, dental, and other systemic disease conditions that may preclude performing the functional requirements of the contract, especially in the austere work environments encountered in some contingency operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with DoD Instruction 6490.03, contracts shall require that CAAF complete a pre-deployment health assessment in the DMSS at the designated deployment center or a Government-authorized contractor-performed deployment processing facility. These assessments will only be used by the DoD to accomplish population-wide assessments for epidemiological purposes, and to help identify trends related to health outcomes and possible exposures. They will not be used for individual purposes in diagnosing conditions or informing individuals they require a medical followup. Diagnosing conditions requiring medical referral is a function of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In general, CAAF who have any of the medical conditions in paragraph (j) of this section, based on an individual assessment pursuant to DoD Instruction 6490.03, should not deploy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Individuals who are deemed not medically qualified at the deployment center or at any period during the deployment process based upon an individual assessment, or who require extensive preventive dental care (see paragraph (j)(2)(xxv) of this section) will not be authorized to deploy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Non-CAAF shall be medically screened when specified by the requiring activity, for the class of labor that is being considered (e.g., LNs working in a dining facility).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Contracts shall require contractors to replace individuals who develop, at any time during their deployment, conditions that cause them to become medically unqualified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In accordance with DoD Instruction 6490.03, contracts shall require that CAAF complete a post-deployment health assessment in DMSS at the termination of the deployment (within 30 days of redeployment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Glasses and Contact Lenses. If vision correction is required, contractor personnel will be required to have two pair of glasses. A written prescription may also be provided to the supporting military medical component so that eyeglass inserts for use in a compatible chemical protective mask can be prepared. If the type of protective mask to be issued is known and time permits, the preparation of eyeglass inserts should be completed prior to deployment. Wearing contact lenses in a field environment is not recommended and is at the contingency contractor employee's own risk due to the potential for irreversible eye damage caused by debris, chemical or other hazards present, and the lack of ophthalmologic care in a field environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Medications. Other than force health protection prescription products (FHPPPs) to be provided to CAAF and selected non-CAAF, contracts shall require that contractor personnel deploy with a minimum 90-day supply of any required medications obtained at their own expense. Contractor personnel must be aware that deployed medical units are equipped and staffed to provide emergency care to healthy adults. They will not be able to provide or replace many medications required for routine treatment of chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart conditions, and arthritis. The

contract shall require contractor personnel to review both the amount of the medication and its suitability in the foreign area with their personal physician and make any necessary adjustments before deploying. The contract shall require the contractor to be responsible for the re-supply of required medications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Comfort Items. The contract shall require that CAAF take spare hearing-aid batteries, sunglasses, insect repellent, sunscreen, and any other supplies related to their individual physical requirements. These items will not be provided by DoD sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Immunizations. A list of immunizations, both those required for entry into the designated area of operations and those recommended by medical authorities, shall be produced for each deployment; posted to the geographic CCDR Web site or other venue, as appropriate; and incorporated in contracts for performance in the designated AOR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The geographic CCDR, upon the recommendation of the appropriate medical authority (e.g., Combatant Command surgeon), shall provide guidance and a list of immunizations required to protect against communicable diseases judged to be a potential hazard to the health of those deploying to the applicable theater of operation. The Combatant Command surgeon of the deployed location shall prepare and maintain this list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The contract shall require that CAAF be appropriately immunized before completing the pre-deployment process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Government shall provide military-specific vaccinations and immunizations (e.g., anthrax, smallpox) during pre-deployment processing. However, the contract shall stipulate that CAAF obtain all other immunizations (e.g., yellow fever, tetanus, typhoid, flu, hepatitis A and B, meningococcal, and tuberculin (TB) skin testing) prior to arrival at the deployment center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Theater-specific medical supplies and FHPPPs, such as anti-malarials and pyridostigmine bromide, will be provided to CAAF and selected non-CAAF on the same basis as they are to active duty military members. Additionally, CAAF will be issued deployment medication information sheets for all vaccines or deployment-related medications that are dispensed or administered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A TB skin test is required within 3 months prior to deployment. Additionally, the contract shall stipulate that CAAF and selected non-CAAF bring to the JOA a current copy of Public Health Service Form 791, ``International Certificate of Vaccination,'' (also known as ``shot record,'' available for purchase at http://bookstore.gpo.gov/ collections/ vaccination.jsp).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing. HIV testing is not mandatory for contingency contractor personnel unless specified by an agreement or by local requirements. HIV testing, if required, shall occur within 1 year before deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Armed Forces Repository of Specimen Samples for the Identification of Remains (AFRSSIR). For identification of remains purposes, all CAAF who are U.S. citizens shall obtain a dental panograph and provide a specimen sample suitable for DNA analysis prior to or during deployment processing. The DoD Components shall ensure that all contracts require CAAF who are U.S. citizens to provide specimens for AFRSSIR as a condition of employment according to DoD Instruction 5154.30 (see http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/ 515430p.pdf). Specimens shall be collected and managed as provided in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All CAAF who are U.S. citizens processing through a deployment center will have a sample collected and forwarded to the AFRSSIR for storage. Contracts shall require contractors to verify in SPOT or its successor that AFRSSIR has received the sample or that the DNA reference specimen sample has been collected by the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If CAAF who are U.S. citizens do not process through a deployment center or the defense contractor is authorized to process its own personnel, the contract shall require that the contractor make its own arrangements for collection and storage of the DNA reference specimen through a private facility, or arrange for the storage of the

specimen by contacting AFRSSIR. Regardless of what specimen collection and storage arrangements are made, all defense contractors deploying CAAF who are U.S. citizens must provide the CAAF name and Social Security number, location of the sample, facility contact information, and retrieval plan to AFRSSIR. If AFRSSIR is not used and a CAAF who is a U.S. citizen becomes a casualty, the defense contractor must be able to retrieve identification media for use by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (AFME) or other competent authority to conduct a medical-legal investigation of the incident and identification of the victim(s). These records must be retrievable within 24 hours for forwarding to the AFME when there is a reported incident that would necessitate its use for human remains identification purposes. The defense contractor shall have access to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completed DD Form 93 or equivalent record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Location of employee medical and dental records, including panograph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Location of employee fingerprint record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with DoD Instruction 5154.30 (see http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/ 515430p.pdf), AFRSSIR is responsible for implementing special rules and procedures to ensure the protection of privacy interests in the specimen samples and any DNA analysis of those samples. Specimen samples shall only be used for the purposes outlined in DoD Instruction 5154.30. Other details, including retention and destruction requirements of DNA samples, are addressed in DoD Instruction 5154.30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pre-Existing Medical Conditions. All evaluations of pre-existing medical conditions should be accomplished prior to deployment. Personnel who have pre-existing medical conditions may deploy if all of these conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The condition is not of such a nature that an unexpected worsening is likely to have a medically grave outcome or a negative impact on mission execution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The condition is stable and reasonably anticipated by the pre-deployment medical evaluator not to worsen during the deployment under contractor-provided medical care in-theater in light of the physical, physiological, psychological, environmental, and nutritional effects of the duties and location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any required ongoing health care or medications must be available or accessible to the contractor, independent of the military health system, and have no special handling, storage, or other requirements (e.g., refrigeration requirements and/or cold chain, electrical power requirements) that cannot be met in the specific theater of operations. Personnel must deploy with a minimum 90-day supply of prescription medications other than FHPPPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The condition does not and is not anticipated to require duty limitations that would preclude performance of duty or to impose accommodation. (The nature of the accommodation must be considered. The Combatant Command surgeon (or his delegated representative) is the appropriate authority to evaluate the suitability of the individual's limitations in-theater.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> There is no need for routine out-of-theater evacuation for continuing diagnostics or other evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Conditions Usually Precluding Medical Clearance. (1) This section is not intended to be comprehensive. A list of all possible diagnoses and their severity that should not be approved would be too expansive to list in this part. In general, individuals with the conditions in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(xxx) of this section, based on an individual assessment pursuant to DoD Instruction 6490.03, will not normally be approved for deployment. The medical evaluator must carefully consider whether climate; altitude; nature of available food and housing; availability of medical, behavioral health, and dental services; or other environmental and operational factors may be hazardous to the deploying person's health because of a known physical or mental condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section is not intended to be comprehensive. A list of all possible diagnoses and their severity that should not be approved would be too expansive to list in this part. In general, individuals with the conditions in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(xxx) of this section, based on an individual assessment pursuant to DoD Instruction 6490.03, will not normally be approved for deployment. The medical evaluator must carefully consider whether climate; altitude; nature of available food and housing; availability of medical, behavioral health, and dental services; or other environmental and operational factors may be hazardous to the deploying person's health because of a known physical or mental condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medical clearance for deployment of persons with any of the conditions in this section shall be granted only after consultation with the appropriate Combatant Command surgeon. The

Combatant Command surgeon makes recommendations and serves as the geographic CCDR advisor; however, the geographic CCDR is the final approval or disapproval authority except as provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The Combatant Command surgeon can determine if adequate treatment facilities and specialist support is available at the duty station for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Physical or psychological conditions resulting in the inability to effectively wear IPE, including protective mask, ballistic helmet, body armor, and CBRN protective ensemble, regardless of the nature of the condition that causes the inability to wear the equipment if wearing such equipment may be reasonably anticipated or required in the deployed location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditions that prohibit immunizations or use of FHPPs required for the specific deployment. Depending on the applicable threat assessment, required FHPPs, vaccines, and countermeasures may include atropine, epinephrine and/or 2-pam chloride auto-injectors, certain antimicrobials, antimalarials, and pyridostigmine bromide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any chronic medical condition that requires frequent clinical visits, that fails to respond to adequate conservative treatment, or that necessitates significant limitation of physical activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any medical condition that requires durable medical equipment or appliances or that requires periodic evaluation and/or treatment by medical specialists not readily available in theater (e.g., CPAC machine for sleep apnea).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any unresolved acute or chronic illness or injury that would impair duty performance in a deployed environment during the duration of the deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Active tuberculosis or known blood-borne diseases that may be transmitted to others in a deployed environment. (For HIV infections, see paragraph (j)(2)(xvii) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An acute exacerbation of a physical or mental health condition that could affect duty performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Recurrent loss of consciousness for any reason.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any medical condition that could result in sudden incapacitation including a history of stroke within the last 24 months, seizure disorders, and diabetes mellitus type I or II, treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Hypertension not controlled with medication or that requires frequent monitoring to achieve control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Pregnancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Cancer for which the individual is receiving continuing treatment or that requires periodic specialty medical evaluations during the anticipated duration of the deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Precancerous lesions that have not been treated and/or evaluated and that require treatment and/or evaluation during the anticipated duration of the deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiiii)</em> Any medical condition that requires surgery or for which surgery has been performed that requires rehabilitation or additional surgery to remove devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Asthma that has a Forced Expiratory Volume-1 (FEV-1) of less than or equal to 50 percent of predicted FEV-1 despite appropriate therapy, that has required hospitalization at least 2 times in the last 12 months, or that requires daily systemic oral or injectable steroids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Any musculoskeletal condition that significantly impairs performance of duties in a deployed environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> HIV antibody positive with the presence of progressive clinical illness or immunological deficiency. The Combatant Command surgeon should be consulted in all instances of HIV seropositivity before medical clearance for deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviii)</em> Hearing loss. The requirement for use of a hearing aid does not necessarily preclude deployment. However, the individual must have sufficient unaided hearing to perform duties safely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviiii)</em> Loss of vision. Best corrected visual acuity must meet job requirements to safely perform duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xx)</em> Symptomatic coronary artery disease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxi)</em> History of myocardial infarction within 1 year of deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxii)</em> History of coronary artery bypass graft, coronary artery angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy,

other arterial stenting, or aneurysm repair within 1 year of deployment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiii)</em> Cardiac dysrhythmias or arrhythmias, either symptomatic or requiring medical or electrophysiologic control (presence of an implanted defibrillator and/or pacemaker).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiv)</em> Heart failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxv)</em> Individuals without a dental exam within the last 12 months or who are likely to require dental treatment or reevaluation for oral conditions that are likely to result in dental emergencies within 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxvi)</em> Psychotic and/or bipolar disorders. For detailed guidance on deployment-limiting psychiatric conditions or psychotropic medications, see ASD(HA) Memorandum ``Policy Guidance for Deployment-Limiting Psychiatric Conditions and Medications'' November 7, 2006 (see http://www.ha.osd.mil/ policies/2006/ 061107_ deployment-limiting_ psych_ conditions_ meds.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxvii)</em> Psychiatric disorders under treatment with fewer than 3 months of demonstrated stability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxviii)</em> Clinical psychiatric disorders with residual symptoms that impair duty performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxviiii)</em> Mental health conditions that pose a substantial risk for deterioration and/or recurrence of impairing symptoms in the deployed environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxx)</em> Chronic medical conditions that require ongoing treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, or anticonvulsants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Exceptions to Medical Standards (Waivers). If a contractor believes an individual CAAF employee with one of the conditions listed in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(xxx) of this section can accomplish his or her tasks and duties and tolerate the environmental and operational conditions of the deployed location, the contractor may request a waiver for that individual through the contracting officer or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Waivers are unlikely for contractor personnel and an explanation should be given as to why other persons who meet the medical standards could not be identified to fulfill the deployed duties. Waivers and requests for waivers will include a summary of a detailed medical evaluation or consultation concerning the medical condition(s). Maximization of mission accomplishment and the protection of the health of personnel are the ultimate goals. Justification will include statements indicating the CAAF member's experience, position to be placed in, any known specific hazards of the position, anticipated availability and need for care while deployed, and the benefit expected to accrue from the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medical clearance to deploy or continue serving in a deployed environment for persons with any of the conditions in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(xxx) of this section must have the concurrence by the Combatant Command surgeon, or his designee, who will recommend approval or disapproval to the geographic CCDR. The geographic CCDR, or his designee, is the final decision authority for approvals and disapprovals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For CAAF employees working with Special Operations Forces personnel who have conditions in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(xxx) of this section, medical clearance may be granted after consultation with the appropriate Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) surgeon. The TSOC surgeon, in coordination with the Combatant Command surgeon and senior in-theater medical authority, will ascertain the capability and availability of treatment facilities and specialist support in the general duty area versus the operational criticality of the particular SOF member. The TSOC surgeon will recommend approval or disapproval to the TSOC Commander. The TSOC Commander is the final approval or disapproval authority.</p>
