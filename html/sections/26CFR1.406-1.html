                                Sec. 1.406-1  Treatment of certain employees of foreign subsidiaries
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>,  of a domestic corporation, an individual who is a citizen of the United  States and who is an employee of a foreign subsidiary (as defined in  section 3121</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(8)</em> and the regulations thereunder) of such domestic  corporation shall be treated as an employee of such domestic corporation  if the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cross-references. For rules relating to nondiscrimination  requirements and the determination of compensation, see paragraph (c) of  this section. For rules under which termination of the status of an  individual as an employe of the domestic corporation in certain  instances will not be considered as separation from service for certain  purposes, see paragraph (d) of this section. For rules regarding  deductibility of contribution, see paragraph (e) of this section. For  rules regarding treatment of such individual as an employee of the  domestic corporation under related provisions, see paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of this section--(1) Requirements. This section  shall apply and the employee of the foreign subsidiary shall be treated  as an employee of domestic corporation for the purposes set forth in  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section only if each of the following  requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The domestic corporation must have entered into an agreement  under section 3121(l) to provide social security coverage which applies  to the foreign subsidiary of which such individual is an employee and  which has not been terminated under section 3121(l)(3) or (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan, referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, must  expressly provide for contributions or benefits for individuals who are  citizens of the United States and who are employees of one or more of  its foreign subsidiaries to which an agreement entered into by such  domestic corporation under section 3121(l) applies. The plan must apply  to all of the foreign subsidiaries to which such agreement applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contributions under a funded plan of deferred compensation  (whether or not a plan described in section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a))  must not be provided by any other person with respect to the  remuneration paid to such individual by the foreign subsidiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplementary rules. Subparagraph (l)(ii) of this paragraph does  not modify the requirements for qualification of a plan described in  section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a) and the regulations thereunder. It is  not necessary that the plan provide benefits or contributions for all  United States citizens who are employees of such foreign subsidiaries.  If the plan is amended to cover individuals who are employees by reason  of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the plan will not qualify unless it  meets the coverage requirements of section 410(b)(1) (section 401(a)(3),  as in effect on September 1, 1974, for plan years to which section 410  does not apply; see Sec. 1.410(a)-2 for the effective dates of section  401) and the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4). In  addition, the administrative rules contained in Sec. 1.401(a)-3(e)  (relating to the determination of the contributions or benefits provided  by the employer under the Social Security Act) will also apply for  purposes of determining whether the plan meets the requirements of  section 401. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph,  contributions will not be considered as provided under a funded plan  merely because the foreign subsidiary is required under the laws of the  foreign jurisdiction to pay social insurance taxes or to make similar  payments with respect to the wages paid to the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Nondiscrimination requirements. For purposes  of applying sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b)(1)(B) (section 401(a)(3)(B),  as in effect on September 1, 1974, for plan years to which section 410  does not apply) and the regulations thereunder (relating to  nondiscrimination concerning benefits and contributions and coverage of  employees) with respect to an employee of the foreign subsidiary who is  treated as an employee of the domestic corporation under paragraph  (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the employee is an officer, shareholder, or (with respect to  plan years to which section 410 does not apply) person whose principal  duties consist in supervising the work of other employees of the foreign  subsidiary of the domestic corporation, he shall be treated as having  such capacity with respect to the domestic corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The determination as to whether the employee is a highly  compensated employee shall be made by comparing his total compensation  (determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) with the  compensation of all the employees of the domestic corporation (including  individuals treated as employees of the domestic corporation pursuant to  section 406 and this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of compensation. For purposes of applying section  401(a)(5) and the regulations thereunder, relating to classifications  that will not be considered discriminatory, with respect to an employee  of the foreign subsidiary who is treated as an employee of the domestic  corporation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total compensation of the employee shall be the remuneration  of the employee from the foreign subsidiary (including any allowances  that are paid to the employee because of his employment in a foreign  country) which would constitute his total compensation if his services  had been performed for the domestic corporation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basic or regular rate of compensation of the employee shall  be determined for the employee in the same manner as it is determined  under section 401 for other employees of the domestic corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount paid by the domestic corporation which is  equivalent to the tax imposed with respect to the employee by section  3101 (relating to the tax on employees under the Federal Insurance  Contributions Act) shall be treated as having been paid by the employee  and shall be included in his compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of status as deemed employee not to be treated as  separation from service for purposes of capital gain provisions and  limitation of tax. For purposes of applying the rules, relating to the  treatment of certain distributions which are made after an employee's   separation from service, set forth in section 72(n) as in effect on  September 1, 1974 (with respect to taxable years ending after December  31, 1969, and to which section 402(e) does not apply), and in sections  402(a)(2) and (e) and 403(a)(2) with respect to distributions or  payments made after December 31, 1973, and in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1973) with respect to an employee of a foreign  subsidiary who is treated as an employee of a domestic corporation under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the employee shall not be considered  as separated from the service of the domestic corporation solely by  reason of the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The termination, under the provisions of section 3121(l), of the  agreement entered into by the domestic corporation under that section  which covers the employment of the employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee's becoming an employee of another foreign  subsidiary of the domestic corporation with respect to which such  agreement does not apply,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee's ceasing to be an employee of the foreign  subsidiary by reason of which employment he was treated as an employee  of such domestic corporation, if he becomes an employee of another  corporation controlled by such domestic corporation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The termination of the provision of the plan described in  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, for coverage of United States  citizens who are employees of foreign subsidiaries covered by an  agreement under section 3121(l).  For purposes of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, a corporation is  considered to be controlled by a domestic corporation if such domestic  corporation owns directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of the  voting stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deductibility of contributions--(1) In general. For purposes of  applying sections 404 and 405(c) with respect to the deduction for  contributions made to or under a pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus  plan described in section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section  403(a), or a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a), by a  domestic corporation, or by another corporation which is entitled to  deduct its contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B), on behalf of an  employee of a foreign subsidiary treated as an employee of the domestic  corporation under paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, no  deduction shall be allowed to such domestic corporation or to any other  corporation which would otherwise be entitled to deduct its  contributions on behalf of such employee under one of such sections;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There shall be allowed as a deduction from the gross income of  the foreign subsidiary which is effectively connected with the conduct  of a trade or business within the United States (within the meaning of  section 882 and the regulations thereunder) an amount which is allocable  and apportionable to such gross income under the rules of Sec. 1.861-8  and which in no event may exceed the amount which (but for subdivision  (i) of this subparagraph) would be deductible under section 404 or  section 405(c) by the domestic corporation if the individual were an  employee of the domestic corporation and if his compensation were paid  by the domestic corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any reference to compensation shall be considered to be a  reference to the total compensation of such individual (determined by  applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Year of deduction. Any amount deductible by the foreign  subsidiary under section 406(d) and this paragraph shall be deductible  for its taxable year with or within which ends the taxable year of the  domestic corporation for which the contribution was made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rules. Whether contributions to a plan on behalf of an  employee of the foreign subsidiary who is treated as an employee of the  domestic corporation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or whether  forfeitures with regard to such employee, will require an inclusion in  the income of the domestic corporation or an adjustment in the basis of  its stock in the foreign subsidiary, shall be determined in accordance  with the rules of general application of subtitle A of chapter 1 of the  Code (relating to income taxes).   For example, an unreimbursed contribution by the domestic corporation to  a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a) will be treated,  to the extent each employee's rights to the contribution are  nonforfeitable, as a contribution of capital to the foreign subsidiary  to the extent that such contributions are made on behalf of the  employees of such subsidiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> (relating to special rules for computing  employees' contributions), section 101(b) (relating to employees' death  benefits), section 2039 (relating to annuities), and section 2517  (relating to certain annuities under qualified plans) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nonexempt trust. If the plan of the domestic corporation is a  qualified plan described under section 401(a), the fact that a trust  which forms a part of such plan is not exempt from tax under section  501(a) shall not affect the treatment of an employee of a foreign  subsidiary as an employee of a domestic corporation under section 406(a)  and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  (Sec. 411 Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (88 Stat. 901; 26 U.S.C. 411))  [T.D. 7501, 42 FR 42321, Aug. 23, 1978]</p>
