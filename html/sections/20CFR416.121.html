                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aid or assistance defined. As used in this part 416, the term  aid or assistance means aid or assistance as defined in titles I, X,  XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act, as in effect in December 1973,  and such aid or assistance is eligible for Federal financial  participation in accordance with those titles and the provisions of 45  CFR chapter II as in effect in December 1973.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations of receipt of aid or assistance for December  1973. For the purpose of application of the provisions of this part 416,  the determination as to whether an individual was a recipient of aid or  assistance for December 1973 under a State plan approved under title I,  X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act will be made by the Social  Security Administration. In making such determination, the Social  Security Administration may take into consideration a prior  determination by the appropriate State agency as to whether the  individual was eligible for aid or assistance for December 1973 under  such State plan. Such prior determination, however, shall not be  considered as conclusive in determining whether an individual was a  recipient of aid or assistance for December 1973 under a State plan  approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act for  purposes of application of the provisions of this part 416.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special provision for disabled recipients. For purposes of  Sec. 416.907, the criteria and definitions enumerated in paragraphs (a)  through (c) of this section are applicable in determining whether an  individual was a recipient of aid or assistance (on the basis of  disability) under a State plan approved under title XIV or XVI of the  Act for a month prior to July 1973. It is not necessary that the aid or  assistance for December 1973 and for a month prior to   July 1973 have been paid under the State plan of the same State.
