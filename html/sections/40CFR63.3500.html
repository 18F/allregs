The operating limits apply only  to capture systems and control devices used for purposes of complying  with this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The coating operation(s) must be in compliance with the work  practice standards in Sec. 63.3493 at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must always operate and maintain your affected source,  including all air pollution control and monitoring equipment you use for  purposes   of complying with this subpart, according to the provisions in Sec.  63.6(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your affected source uses an emission capture system and add- on control device for purposes of complying with this subpart, you must  develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (SSMP)  according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). The plan must address  startup, shutdown, and corrective actions in the event of a malfunction  of the emission capture system or the add-on control device. The plan  must also address any coating operation equipment that may cause  increased emissions or that would affect capture efficiency if the  process equipment malfunctions, such as conveyors that move parts among  enclosures.
