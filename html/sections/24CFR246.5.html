                            <p class="depth0">The Department will generally not interfere in the regulation of  rents by a rent control board or agency constituted under State or local  laws (hereinafter referred to as board) for unsubsidized projects with  mortgages insured or held by HUD. However, HUD will preempt the  regulation of rents, together with any board regulations which require  the mortgagor to offer a lease for a term in excess of one year, under  certain conditions. This preemption may occur for such a project when  the Department determines that the delay or decision of a board prevents  the mortgagor from achieving a level of residential income necessary to  maintain and operate adequately the project, which includes sufficient  funds to meet the financial obligations under the mortgage.''</p>
