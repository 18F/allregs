                            <p class="depth0">The slaughtering of cattle, calves, sheep, swine, goats, horses,  mules, and other equines by shooting with firearms and the handling in  connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in  this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of  slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Utilization of firearms, required effect; handling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  firearms shall be employed in the delivery of a bullet or projectile  into the animal in accordance with this section so as to produce  immediate unconsciousness in the animal by a single shot before it is  shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animal shall be shot in  such a manner that they will be rendered unconscious with a minimum of  excitement and discomfort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The driving of the animals to the shooting areas shall be done  with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of  calm animals to the shooting area is essential since accurate placement  of the bullet is difficult in case of nervous or injured animals. Among  other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the shooting  areas, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the  lowest effective voltage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediately after the firearm is discharged and the projectile  is delivered, the animal shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness  and remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking and  bleeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facilities and procedure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements for shooting  facilities; operator. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On discharge, acceptable firearms dispatch  free projectiles or bullets of varying sizes and diameters through the  skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a  combination of physical brain destruction and changes in intracranial  pressure. Caliber of firearms shall be such that when properly aimed and  discharged, the projectile produces immediate unconsciousness.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To assure uniform unconsciousness of the animal with every  discharge where small-bore firearms are employed, it is necessary to use  one of the following type projectiles: Hollow pointed bullets; frangible  iron plastic composition bullets; or powdered iron missiles. When  powdered iron missiles are used, the firearms shall be in close  proximity with the skull of the animal when fired. Firearms must be  maintained in good repair. For purposes of protecting employees,  inspectors and others, it is desirable that all firearms be equipped  with safety devices to prevent injuries from accidental discharge.  Aiming and discharging of firearms should be directed away from  operating areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> with  respect to the stunning area also apply to the shooting area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The shooting operation is an exacting procedure and requires a  well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately  direct the projectile to produce immediate unconsciousness. He must use  the correct caliber firearm, powder charge and type of ammunition to  produce the desired results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special requirements. Choice of firearms and ammunition with  respect to caliber and choice of powder charge required to produce  immediate unconsciousness of the animal may vary depending on age and  sex of the animal. In the case of bulls, rams, and boars, small bore  firearms may be used provided they are able to produce immediate  unconsciousness of the animals. Small bore firearms are usually  effective for stunning other cattle, sheep, swine, and goats, and  calves, horses, and mules.</p>
