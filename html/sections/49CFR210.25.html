representative of its manufacturer, or a person of equivalent special competence to verify that its accuracy meets the manufacturer's design criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An acoustical calibrator of the microphone coupler type designed for the sound level measurement system in use shall be used to calibrate the sound level measurement system in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The calibration must meet or exceed the accuracy requirements specified in section 5.4.1 of the American National Standard Institute Standards, ``Method for Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels,'' (ANSI S1.13-1971) for field method measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acoustical environment, weather conditions, and background noise requirements are prescribed in Sec. 201.23 of the Standards.
