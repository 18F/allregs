                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> and to compute rebate  liability under section 148(f). Yield is computed under the economic  accrual method using any consistently applied compounding interval of  not more than one year. A short first compounding interval and a short  last compounding interval may be used. Yield is expressed as an annual  percentage rate that is calculated to at least four decimal places  (e.g., 5.2525 percent). Other reasonable, standard financial  conventions, such as the 30 days per month/360 days per year convention,  may be used in computing yield but must be consistently applied. The  yield on an issue that would be a purpose investment (absent section  148(b)(3)(A)) is equal to the yield on the conduit financing issue that  financed that purpose investment. The Commissioner may permit issuers of  qualified   mortgage bonds or qualified student loan bonds to use a single yield for  two or more issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computing yield on a fixed yield issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Yield on an issue. The yield on a fixed yield issue is the discount rate  that, when used in computing the present value as of the issue date of  all unconditionally payable payments of principal, interest, and fees  for qualified guarantees on the issue and amounts reasonably expected to  be paid as fees for qualified guarantees on the issue, produces an  amount equal to the present value, using the same discount rate, of the  aggregate issue price of bonds of the issue as of the issue date.  Further, payments include certain amounts properly allocable to a  qualified hedge. Yield on a fixed yield issue is computed as of the  issue date and is not affected by subsequent unexpected events, except  to the extent provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Yield on a bond. Yield on a fixed yield bond is computed in the  same manner as yield on a fixed yield issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, excess proceeds calls for issues for which the  requirements of Sec. 1.148-2(e) (2) or (3) are satisfied, calamity  calls, and refundings do not cause a bond to be subject to early  redemption. The value of a bond is determined under paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, each of those  bonds must be treated as redeemed at its present value, unless the  stated redemption price at maturity of the bond does not exceed the  issue price of the bond by more than one-fourth of one percent  multiplied by the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and  the number of years to the weighted average maturity date of the  substantially identical bonds, in which case each of those bonds must be  treated as redeemed at its outstanding stated principal amount, plus  accrued, unpaid interest. Weighted average maturity is determined by  taking into account the mandatory redemption schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Yield on certain fixed yield bonds subject to optional early  redemption--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a fixed yield bond is subject to optional  early redemption and is described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this  section, the yield on the issue containing the bond is computed by  treating the bond as redeemed at its stated redemption price on the  optional redemption date that would produce the lowest yield on the  issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> only if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is subject to optional redemption within five years of the issue  date, but only if the yield on the issue computed   by assuming all bonds in the issue subject to redemption within 5 years  of the issue date are redeemed at maturity is more than one-eighth of  one percentage point higher than the yield on that issue computed by  assuming all bonds subject to optional redemption within 5 years of the  issue date are redeemed at the earliest date for their redemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is issued at an issue price that exceeds the stated redemption  price at maturity by more than one-fourth of one percent multiplied by  the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of  complete years to the first optional redemption date for the bond; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Bears interest at increasing interest rates (i.e., a stepped  coupon bond).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Yield recomputed upon transfer of certain rights associated with  the bond. For purposes of Sec. 1.148-3, as of the date of any transfer,  waiver, modification, or similar transaction (collectively, a transfer)  of any right that is part of the terms of a bond or is otherwise  associated with a bond (e.g., a redemption right), in a transaction that  is separate and apart from the original sale of the bond, the issue is  treated as if it were retired and a new issue issued on the date of the  transfer (reissued). The redemption price of the retired issue and the  issue price of the new issue equal the aggregate values of all the bonds  of the issue on the date of the transfer. In computing yield on the new  issue, any amounts received by the issuer as consideration for the  transfer are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special aggregation rule treating certain bonds as a single  fixed yield bond. Two variable yield bonds of an issue are treated in  the aggregate as a single fixed yield bond if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Aggregate treatment would result in the single bond being a  fixed yield bond; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The terms of the bonds do not contain any features that could  distort the aggregate fixed yield from what the yield would be if a  single fixed yield bond were issued. For example, if an issue contains a  bond bearing interest at a floating rate and a related bond bearing  interest at a rate equal to a fixed rate minus that floating rate, those  two bonds are treated as a single fixed yield bond only if neither bond  may be redeemed unless the other bond is also redeemed at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 1994, City A  issues an issue consisting of four identical fixed yield bonds. The  stated final maturity date of each bond is January 1, 2004, and no bond  is subject to redemption before this date. Interest is payable on  January 1 of each year at a rate of 6.0000 percent per year on the  outstanding principal amount. The total stated principal amount of the  bonds is $20 million. The issue price of the bonds $20,060,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation. The yield on the issue is computed by treating the  bonds as retired at the stated maturity under the general rule of Sec.  1.148-4(b)(1).

The lowest yield on the issue would result from a redemption of  all the bonds on January 1, 1999. Thus, the yield on the issue is 5.9126  percent per year compounded semiannually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computing yield on a variable yield issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  yield on a variable yield issue is computed separately for each  computation period. The yield for each computation period is the  discount rate that, when used in computing the present value as of the  first day of the computation period of all the payments of principal and  interest and fees for qualified guarantees that are attributable to the  computation period, produces an amount equal to the present value, using  the same discount rate, of the aggregate issue price (or deemed issue  price, as determined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) of the  bonds of the issue as of the first day of the computation period. The  yield on a variable yield bond is computed in the same manner as the  yield on a variable yield issue. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section, yield on any fixed yield bond in a variable yield issue  is computed in the same manner as the yield on a fixed yield issue as  provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments on bonds included in yield for a computation period-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments in general. The payments on a bond that are attributable to  a computation period include any amounts actually paid during the period  for principal on the bond. Payments also include any amounts paid during  the current period both for interest accruing on the bond during the  current period and for interest accruing during the prior period that  was included in the deemed issue price of the bond as accrued unpaid  interest at the start of the current period under this paragraph (c)(2).  Further, payments include any amounts properly allocable to fees for a  qualified guarantee of the bond for the period and to any amounts  properly allocable to a qualified hedge for the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments at actual redemption. If a bond is actually redeemed  during a computation period, an amount equal to the greater of its value  on the redemption date or the actual redemption price is a payment on  the actual redemption date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payments for bonds outstanding at end of computation period.  If a bond is outstanding at the end of a computation period, a payment  equal to the bond's value is taken into account on the last day of that  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Issue price for bonds outstanding at beginning of next  computation period. A bond outstanding at the end of a computation  period is treated as if it were immediately reissued on the next day for  a deemed issue price equal to the value from the day before as  determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated  by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, 1994, City A issues an issue of identical  plain par bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. The  bonds pay interest at a variable rate on each June 1 throughout the term  of the issue. The entire principal amount of the bonds plus accrued,  unpaid interest is payable on the final maturity date of January 1,  2000. No bond year is selected. On June 1, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and  1998, interest in the amounts of $30,000, $55,000, $57,000, $56,000, and  $45,000 is paid on the bonds. From June 1, 1998, to January 1, 1999,  $30,000 of interest accrues on the bonds. From January 1, 1999, to June  1, 1999, another $35,000 of interest accrues. On June 1, 1999, the  issuer actually pays $65,000 of interest. On January 1, 2000, $1,000,000  of principal and $38,000 of accrued interest are paid. The payments for  the computation period starting on the issue date and ending on January  1, 1999, include all annual interest payments paid from the issue date  to June 1, 1998. Because the issue is outstanding on January 1, 1999, it  is treated as redeemed on that date for amount equal to its value  ($1,000,000 plus accrued, unpaid interest of $30,000 under paragraph  (e)(1) of this section). Thus, $1,030,000 is treated as paid on January  1, 1999. The issue is then treated as reissued on January 1, 1999, for  $1,030,000. The payments for the next computation period starting on  January 1, 1999, and ending on January 1, 2000, include the interest  actually paid on the bonds during that period ($65,000 on June 1, 1999,  plus $38,000 paid on January 1, 2000). Because the issue was actually  redeemed on January 1, 2000, an amount equal to its stated redemption  price is also treated as paid on January 1, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Conversion from variable yield issue to fixed yield issue. For  purposes of determining yield under this section, as of the first day on  which a variable yield issue would qualify as a fixed yield issue if it  were newly issued on that date (a conversion date), that issue is  treated as if it were reissued as a fixed yield issue on the conversion  date. The redemption price of the variable yield issue and the issue  price of the fixed yield issue equal the aggregate values of all the  bonds on the conversion date. Thus, for example, for plain par bonds  (e.g., tender bonds), the deemed issue price would be the outstanding  principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest. If the conversion date  occurs on a date other than a computation date, the issuer may continue  to treat the issue as a variable yield issue until the next computation  date, at which time it must be treated as converted to a fixed yield  issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Value of bonds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Plain par bonds. Except as otherwise  provided, the value of a plain par bond is its outstanding stated  principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest. The value of a plain par  bond that is actually redeemed or treated as redeemed is its stated  redemption price on the redemption date, plus accrued, unpaid interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the  initial interest rate on the bond established by the interest index or  other interest rate setting mechanism is used to determine the interest  payments on that bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Qualified guarantees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Fees properly allocable to  payments for a qualified guarantee for an issue (as determined under  paragraph (f)(6) of this section) are treated as additional interest on  that issue under section 148. A guarantee is a qualified guarantee if it  satisfies each of the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest savings. As of the date the guarantee is obtained, the  issuer must reasonably expect that the present value of the fees for the  guarantee will be less than the present value of the expected interest  savings on the issue as a result of the guarantee. For this purpose,  present value is computed using the yield on the issue, determined with  regard to guarantee payments, as the discount rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Guarantee in substance. The arrangement must create a guarantee  in substance. The arrangement must impose a secondary liability that  unconditionally shifts substantially all of the credit risk for all or  part of the payments, such as payments for principal and interest,  redemption prices, or tender prices, on the guaranteed bonds. Reasonable  procedural or administrative requirements of the guarantee do not cause  the guarantee to be conditional. In the case of a guarantee against  failure to remarket a qualified tender bond, commercially reasonable  limitations based on credit risk, such as limitations on payment in the  event of default by the primary obligor or the bankruptcy of a long-term  credit guarantor, do not cause the guarantee to be conditional. The  guarantee may be in any form. The guarantor may not be a co-obligor.  Thus, the guarantor must not expect to make any payments other than  under a direct-pay letter of credit or similar arrangement for which the  guarantor will be reimbursed immediately. The guarantor and any related  parties together must not use more than 10 percent of the proceeds of  the portion of the issue allocable to the guaranteed bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable charge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Fees for a guarantee must not  exceed a reasonable, arm's-length charge for the transfer of credit  risk. In complying with this requirement, the issuer may not rely on the  representations of the guarantor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fees for services other than transfer of credit risk must be  separately stated. A fee for a guarantee must not include any payment  for any direct or indirect services other than the transfer of credit  risk, unless the compensation for those other services is separately  stated, reasonable, and excluded from the guarantee fee. Fees for the  transfer of credit risk include fees for the guarantor's overhead and  other costs relating to the transfer of credit risk. For example, a fee  includes payment for services other than transfer of credit risk if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It includes payment for the cost of underwriting or remarketing  bonds or for the cost of insurance for casualty to bond-financed  property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is refundable upon redemption of the guaranteed bond before  the final maturity date and the amount of the refund would exceed the  portion of the fee that had not been earned; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requirements of Sec. 1.148-2(e)(2) (relating to temporary  periods for capital projects) are not satisfied, and the guarantor is  not reasonably assured that the bonds will be repaid if the project to  be financed is not completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> only applies if,  in addition to satisfying the other requirements of this paragraph (f),  the guarantee is, in substance, a guarantee of the bonds allocable to  that purpose investment and to no other bonds except for bonds that are  equally and ratably secured by purpose investments of the same conduit  borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of qualified guarantee payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Payments for a qualified guarantee must be allocated to bonds and to  computation periods in   a manner that properly reflects the proportionate credit risk for which  the guarantor is compensated. Proportionate credit risk for bonds that  are not substantially identical may be determined using any reasonable,  consistently applied method. For example, this risk may be based on the  ratio of the total principal and interest paid and to be paid on a  guaranteed bond to the total principal and interest paid and to be paid  on all bonds of the guaranteed issue. An allocation method generally is  not reasonable, for example, if a substantial portion of the fee is  allocated to the construction portion of the issue and a correspondingly  insubstantial portion is allocated to the later years covered by the  guarantee. Reasonable letter of credit set up fees may be allocated  ratably during the initial term of the letter of credit. Upon an early  redemption of a variable yield bond, fees otherwise allocable to the  period after the redemption are allocated to remaining outstanding bonds  of the issue or, if none remain outstanding, to the period before the  redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Refund or reduction of guarantee payments. If as a result of an  investment of proceeds of a refunding issue in a refunding escrow, there  will be a reduction in, or refund of, payments for a guarantee  (savings), the savings must be treated as a reduction in the payments on  the refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> with respect to purpose investments  allocable to a variable yield issue of qualified mortgage bonds,  qualified veterans' mortgage bonds, or qualified student loan bonds that  is reasonably expected as of the issue date to convert to a fixed yield  issue, the yield may be computed over the term of the issue, and, if the  yield is so computed, paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to  the issue. As of any date, the yield over the term of the issue is based  on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With respect to any bond of the issue that has not converted to  a fixed and determinable yield on or before that date, the actual  amounts paid or received to that date and the amounts that are  reasonably expected (as of that date) to be paid or received with  respect to that bond over the remaining term of the issue (taking into  account prepayment assumptions under section 143(g)(2)(B)(iv), if  applicable); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(B)(iv)</em>, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Qualified hedging transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Payments made or  received by an issuer under a qualified hedge (as defined in paragraph  (h)(2) of this section) relating to bonds of an issue are taken into  account (as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) to determine  the yield on the issue. Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(4) and  (h)(5)(ii)(E) of this section, the bonds to which a qualified hedge  relates are treated as variable yield bonds from the issue date of the  bonds. This paragraph (h) applies solely for purposes of sections  143(g), 148, and 149(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified hedge defined. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)  of this section, the term qualified hedge means a contract that  satisfies each of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hedge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The contract is entered into primarily to  modify the issuer's risk of interest rate changes with respect to a bond  (a hedge). For example, the contract may be an interest rate swap, an  interest rate cap, a futures contract, a forward contract, or an option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for fixed rate issues. If the contract modifies the  issuer's risk of interest rate changes with respect to a bond that is  part of an issue that, absent the contract, would be a fixed rate issue,  the contract must be entered into--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No later than 15 days after the issue date (or the deemed issue  date under paragraph (d) of this section) of the issue; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(B)(1)</em> of this  section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contracts with certain acquisition payments. If a hedge provider  makes a single payment to the issuer (e.g., a payment for an off-market  swap) in connection with the acquisition of a contract, the issuer may  treat a portion of that contract as a hedge provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The hedge provider's payment to the issuer and the issuer's  payments under the contract in excess of those that it would make if the  contract bore rates equal to the on-market rates for the contract  (determined as of the date the parties enter into the contract) are  separately identified in a certification of the hedge provider; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(C)(1)</em> of this  section are not treated as payments on the hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No significant investment element--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The contract  does not contain a significant investment element. Except as provided in  paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a contract contains a  significant investment element if a significant portion of any payment  by one party relates to a conditional or unconditional obligation by the  other party to make a payment on a different date. Examples of contracts  that contain a significant investment element are a debt instrument held  by the issuer; an interest rate swap requiring any payments other than  periodic payments, within the meaning of Sec. 1.446-3 (periodic  payments) (e.g., a payment for an off-market swap or prepayment of part  or all of one leg of a swap); and an interest rate cap requiring the  issuer's premium for the cap to be paid in a single, up-front payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special level payment rule for interest rate caps. An interest  rate cap does not contain a significant investment element if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All payments to the issuer by the hedge provider are periodic  payments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The issuer makes payments for the cap at the same time as  periodic payments by the hedge provider must be made if the specified  index (within the meaning of Sec. 1.446-3) of the cap is above the  strike price of the cap; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each payment by the issuer bears the same ratio to the notional  principal amount (within the meaning of Sec. 1.446-3) that is used to  compute the hedge provider's payment, if any, on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Parties. The contract is entered into between the issuer or  the political subdivision on behalf of which the issuer issues the bonds  (collectively referred to in this paragraph (h) as the issuer) and a  provider that is not a related party (the hedge provider).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Hedged bonds. The contract covers, in whole or in part, all of  one or more groups of substantially identical bonds in the issue (i.e.,  all of the bonds having the same interest rate, maturity, and terms).  Thus, for example, a qualified hedge may include a hedge of all or a pro  rata portion of each interest payment on the variable rate bonds in an  issue for the first 5 years following their issuance. For purposes of  this paragraph (h), unless the context clearly requires otherwise,  hedged bonds means the specific bonds or portions thereof covered by a  hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Interest based contract. The contract is primarily interest  based. A   contract is not primarily interest based unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The hedged bond, without regard to the contract, is either a  fixed rate bond, a variable rate debt instrument within the meaning of  Sec. 1.1275-5 provided the rate is not based on an objective rate other  than a qualified inverse floating rate or a qualified inflation rate, a  tax-exempt obligation described in Sec. 1.1275-4(d)(2), or an  inflation-indexed debt instrument within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-7;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As a result of treating all payments on (and receipts from) the  contract as additional payments on (and receipts from) the hedged bond,  the resulting bond would be substantially similar to either a fixed rate  bond, a variable rate debt instrument within the meaning of Sec.  1.1275-5 provided the rate is not based on an objective rate other than  a qualified inverse floating rate or a qualified inflation rate, a tax- exempt obligation described in Sec. 1.1275-4(d)(2), or an inflation- indexed debt instrument within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-7. For this  purpose, differences that would not prevent the resulting bond from  being substantially similar to another type of bond include a difference  between the index used to compute payments on the hedged bond and the  index used to compute payments on the hedge where one index is  substantially the same, but not identical to, the other; the difference  resulting from the payment of a fixed premium for a cap (e.g., payments  for a cap that are made in other than level installments); and the  difference resulting from the allocation of a termination payment where  the termination was not expected as of the date the contract was entered  into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Payments closely correspond. The payments received by the  issuer from the hedge provider under the contract correspond closely in  time to either the specific payments being hedged on the hedged bonds or  specific payments required to be made pursuant to the bond documents,  regardless of the hedge, to a sinking fund, debt service fund, or  similar fund maintained for the issue of which the hedged bond is a  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Source of payments. Payments to the hedge provider are  reasonably expected to be made from the same source of funds that,  absent the hedge, would be reasonably expected to be used to pay  principal and interest on the hedged bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Accounting for qualified hedges--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, payments made or  received by the issuer under a qualified hedge are treated as payments  made or received, as appropriate, on the hedged bonds that are taken  into account in determining the yield on those bonds. These payments are  reasonably allocated to the hedged bonds in the period to which the  payments relate, as determined under paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this  section. Payments made or received by the issuer include payments deemed  made or received when a contract is terminated or deemed terminated  under this paragraph (h)(3). Payments reasonably allocable to the  modification of risk of interest rate changes and to the hedge  provider's overhead under this paragraph (h) are included as payments  made or received under a qualified hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusions from hedge. If any payment for services or other  items under the contract is not expressly treated by paragraph (h)(3)(i)  of this section as a payment under the qualified hedge, the payment is  not a payment with respect to a qualified hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Timing and allocation of payments. Except as provided in  paragraphs   (h)(3)(iv) and (h)(5) of this section, payments made or received by the  issuer under a qualified hedge are taken into account in the same period  in which those amounts would be treated as income or deductions under  Sec. 1.446-4 (without regard to Sec. 1.446-4(a)(2)(iv)) and are  adjusted as necessary to reflect the end of a computation period and the  start of a new computation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Termination payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Termination defined. A termination of  a qualified hedge includes any sale or other disposition of the hedge by  the issuer or the acquisition by the issuer of an offsetting hedge. A  deemed termination occurs when the hedged bonds are redeemed or when a  hedge ceases to be a qualified hedge of the hedged bonds. In the case of  an assignment by a hedge provider of its remaining rights and  obligations under the hedge to a third party or a modification of the  hedging contract, the assignment or modification is treated as a  termination with respect to the issuer only if it results in a deemed  exchange of the hedge and a realization event under section 1001 to the  issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> General rule. A payment made or received by an issuer to  terminate a qualified hedge, including loss or gain realized or deemed  realized, is treated as a payment made or received on the hedged bonds,  as appropriate. The payment is reasonably allocated to the remaining  periods originally covered by the terminated hedge in a manner that  reflects the economic substance of the hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> and in paragraph  (h)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, when a qualified hedge is deemed  terminated because the hedged bonds are redeemed, the fair market value  of the qualified hedge on the redemption date is treated as a  termination payment made or received on that date. When hedged bonds are  redeemed, any payment received by the issuer on termination of a hedge,  including a termination payment or a deemed termination payment,  reduces, but not below zero, the interest payments made by the issuer on  the hedged bonds in the computation period ending on the termination  date. The remainder of the payment, if any, is reasonably allocated over  the bond years in the immediately preceding computation period or  periods to the extent necessary to eliminate the excess.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Special rules for refundings. To the extent that the hedged  bonds are redeemed using the proceeds of a refunding issue, the  termination payment is accounted for under paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B) of  this section by treating it as a payment on the refunding issue, rather  than the hedged bonds. In addition, to the extent that the refunding  issue is redeemed during the period to which the termination payment has  been allocated to that issue, paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(C) of this section  applies to the termination payment by treating it as a payment on the  redeemed refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em>. For an issue that is a variable yield issue  after termination of a qualified hedge, an amount must be allocated to  each date on which the hedge provider's payment, if any, would have been  made had the hedge not been terminated. The amounts allocated to each  date must bear the same ratio to the notional principal amount (within  the meaning of Sec. 1.446-3) that would have been used to compute the  hedge provider's payment, if any, on that date, and the sum of the  present values of those amounts must equal the present value of the  termination payment. Present value is computed as of the day the  qualified hedge is terminated, using the yield on the hedged bonds,  determined without regard to the termination payment. The yield used for  this purpose is computed for the period beginning on the first date the  qualified hedge is in effect and ending on the date the qualified hedge  is terminated. On the other hand, for an issue that is a fixed yield  issue after termination of a qualified hedge, the termination payment is  taken into account as a single payment on the date it is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain variable yield bonds treated as fixed yield bonds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h)(4), if  the issuer of variable yield bonds enters into a qualified hedge, the  hedged bonds are treated as fixed yield bonds paying a fixed interest  rate if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Maturity. The term of the hedge is equal to the entire period  during which the hedged bonds bear interest at variable interest rates,  and the issuer does not reasonably expect that the hedge will be  terminated before the end of that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payments closely correspond. Payments to be received under the  hedge correspond closely in time to the hedged portion of payments on  the hedged bonds. Hedge payments received within 15 days of the related  payments on the hedged bonds generally so correspond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> if payments on the bonds are  based, in whole or in part, on one interest rate, payments on the hedge  are based, in whole or in part, on a second interest rate that is  substantially the same as, but not identical to, the first interest rate  and payments on the bonds would be fixed if the two rates were  identical. Rates are treated as substantially the same if they are  reasonably expected to be substantially the same throughout the term of  the hedge. For example, an objective 30-day tax-exempt variable rate  index or other objective index may be substantially the same as an  issuer's individual 30-day interest rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, in determining yield on the hedged bonds, all the issuer's  payments on the hedged bonds and all payments made and received on a  hedge described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section are taken into  account. If payments on the bonds and payments on the hedge are based,  in whole or in part, on variable interest rates that are substantially  the same within the meaning of paragraph (h)(4)(i)(C) of this section  (but not identical), yield on the issue is determined by treating the  variable interest rates as identical. For example, if variable rate  bonds bearing interest at a weekly rate equal to the rate necessary to  remarket the bonds at par are hedged with an interest rate swap under  which the issuer receives payments based on a short-term floating rate  index that is substantially the same as, but not identical to, the  weekly rate on the bonds, the interest payments on the bonds are treated  as equal to the payments received by the issuer under the swap for  purposes of computing the yield on the bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of termination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) and paragraph (h)(5) of this  section, the issue of which the hedged bonds are a part is treated as if  it were reissued as of the termination date of the qualified hedge  covered by paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section in determining yield on  the hedged bonds for purposes of Sec. 1.148-3. The redemption price of  the retired issue and the issue price of the new issue equal the  aggregate values of all the bonds of the issue on the termination date.  In computing the yield on the new issue for this purpose, any  termination payment is accounted for under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this  section, applied by treating the termination payment as made or received  on the new issue under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of early termination. Except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (h)(4)(iii), the general rules of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of  this section do not apply in determining the yield on the hedged bonds  for purposes of Sec. 1.148-3 if the hedge is terminated or deemed  terminated within 5 years after the issue date of the issue of which the  hedged bonds are a part. Thus, the hedged bonds are treated as variable  yield bonds for purposes of Sec. 1.148-3 from the issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certain terminations disregarded. This paragraph (h)(4)(iii)  does not apply to a termination if, based on the facts and circumstances  (e.g., taking into account both the termination and   any qualified hedge that immediately replaces the terminated hedge),  there is no change in the yield.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Contracts entered into before issue date of hedged bond--(i) In  general. A contract does not fail to be a hedge under paragraph  (h)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section solely because it is entered into before the  issue date of the hedged bond. However, that contract must be one to  which either paragraph (h)(5)(ii) or (h)(5)(iii) of this section  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contracts expected to be closed substantially contemporaneously  with the issue date of hedged bond--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Application. This paragraph  (h)(5)(ii) applies to a contract if, on the date the contract is  identified, the issuer reasonably expects to terminate or otherwise  close (terminate) the contract substantially contemporaneously with the  issue date of the hedged bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contract terminated. If a contract to which this paragraph  (h)(5)(ii) applies is terminated substantially contemporaneously with  the issue date of the hedged bond, the amount paid or received, or  deemed to be paid or received, by the issuer in connection with the  issuance of the hedged bond to terminate the contract is treated as an  adjustment to the issue price of the hedged bond and as an adjustment to  the sale proceeds of the hedged bond for purposes of section 148.  Amounts paid or received, or deemed to be paid or received, before the  issue date of the hedged bond are treated as paid or received on the  issue date in an amount equal to the future value of the payment or  receipt on that date. For this purpose, future value is computed using  yield on the hedged bond without taking into account amounts paid or  received (or deemed paid or received) on the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, payments on and receipts from the contract are  no longer taken into account under this paragraph (h) for purposes of  determining yield on the hedged bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Relation to other requirements of a qualified hedge. Payments  made in connection with the issuance of a bond to terminate a contract  to which this paragraph (h)(5)(ii) applies do not prevent the contract  from satisfying the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(vi) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Fixed yield treatment. A bond that is hedged with a contract to  which this paragraph (h)(5)(ii) applies does not fail to be a fixed  yield bond if, taking into account payments on the contract and the  payments to be made on the bond, the bond satisfies the definition of  fixed yield bond. See also paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contracts expected not to be closed substantially  contemporaneously with the issue date of hedged bond--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Application.  This paragraph (h)(5)(iii) applies to a contract if, on the date the  contract is identified, the issuer does not reasonably expect to  terminate the contract substantially contemporaneously with the issue  date of the hedge bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contract terminated. If a contract to which this paragraph  (h)(5)(iii) applies is terminated in connection with the issuance of the  hedged bond, the amount paid or received, or deemed to be paid or  received, by the issuer to terminate the contract is treated as an  adjustment to the issue price of the hedged bond and as an adjustment to  the sale proceeds of the hedged bond for purposes of section 148.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contract not terminated. If a contract to which this paragraph  (h)(5)(iii) applies is not terminated substantially contemporaneously  with the issue date of the hedged bond, no payments with respect to the  hedge made by the issuer before the issue date of the hedged bond are  taken into account under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> that would  be a qualified hedge with respect to the anticipated bond, but does not  issue the anticipated bond on the identified issue date, the contract is  taken into account as a qualified hedge of any bond of the issuer that  is issued for the identified governmental purpose within a reasonable  interval around the identified issue date of the anticipated bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Authority of the Commissioner. The Commissioner, by publication  of a revenue ruling or revenue procedure (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of  this chapter), may specify contracts that, although they do not meet the  requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, are qualified hedges  or, although they do not meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of  this section, cause the hedged bonds to be treated as fixed yield bonds.
