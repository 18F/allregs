Approval does not constitute release of CCC's security interest in the commodity or release of producer liability for amounts due CCC for the marketing assistance loan indebtedness if payment in full is not received by the county office. Failure to repay a marketing assistance loan within the time period prescribed by CCC in the case of a farm-stored loan and delivery of the pledged collateral to a buyer is a violation of the agreement.
