Sec. 9905.501-10  [Reserved]


Sec. 9905.501-20  Purpose.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to ensure that each educational institution's practices used in estimating costs for a proposal are consistent with cost accounting practices used by the institution in accumulating and reporting costs. Consistency in the application of cost accounting practices is necessary to enhance the likelihood that comparable transactions are treated alike. With respect to individual contracts, the consistent application of cost accounting practices will facilitate the preparation of reliable cost estimates used in pricing a proposal and their comparison with the costs of performance of the resulting contract. Such comparisons provide one important basis for financial control over costs during contract performance and aid in establishing accountability for costs in the manner agreed to by both parties at the time of contracting. The comparisons also provide an improved basis for evaluating estimating capabilities.


Sec. 9905.501-30  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in this

Standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph (b) of this subsection requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accumulating costs means the collecting of cost data in an organized manner, such as through a system of accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actual cost means an amount determined on the basis of cost incurred (as distinguished from forecasted cost), including standard cost properly adjusted for applicable variance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estimating costs means the process of forecasting a future result in terms of cost, based upon information available at the time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indirect cost pool means a grouping of incurred costs identified with two or more objectives but not identified specifically with any final cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pricing means the process of establishing the amount or amounts to be paid in return for goods or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Proposal means any offer or other submission used as a basis for pricing a contract, contract modification or termination settlement or for securing payments thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reporting costs means the providing of cost information to others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.


Sec. 9905.501-40  Fundamental requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An educational institution's practices used in estimating costs in pricing a proposal shall be consistent with the institution's cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An educational institution's cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting actual costs for a contract shall be consistent with the institution's practices used in estimating costs in pricing the related proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The grouping of homogeneous costs in estimates prepared for proposal purposes shall not per se be deemed an inconsistent application of cost accounting practices under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection when such costs are accumulated and reported in greater detail on an actual cost basis during contract performance.


Sec. 9905.501-50  Techniques for application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The standard allows grouping of homogeneous costs in order to cover those cases where it is not practicable to estimate contract costs by individual cost element. However, costs estimated for proposal purposes shall be presented in such a manner and in such detail that any significant cost can be compared with the actual cost accumulated and reported therefor. In any event, the cost accounting practices used in estimating costs in pricing a proposal and in accumulating and reporting costs on the resulting contract shall be consistent with respect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The classification of elements of cost as direct or indirect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The indirect cost pools to which each element of cost is charged or proposed to be charged; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methods of allocating indirect costs to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adherence to the requirement of 9905.501-40(a) of this standard shall be determined as of the date of award of the contract, unless the contractor has submitted cost or pricing data pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2306(a) or 41 U.S.C. 254(d) (Pub. L. 87-653), in which case adherence to the requirement of 9905.501-40(a) shall be determined as of the date of final agreement on price, as shown on the signed certificate of current cost or pricing data. Notwithstanding 9905.501-40(b), changes in established cost accounting practices during contract performance may be made in accordance with part 9903 (48 CFR part 9903).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The standard does not prescribe the amount of detail required in accumulating and reporting costs. The basic requirement which must be met, however, is that for any significant amount of estimated cost, the contractor must be able to accumulate and report actual cost at a level which permits sufficient and meaningful comparison with its estimates. The amount of detail required may vary considerably depending on how the proposed costs were estimated, the data presented in justification or lack thereof,

and the significance of each situation. Accordingly, it is neither appropriate nor practical to prescribe a single set of accounting practices which would be consistent in all situations with the practices of estimating costs. Therefore, the amount of accounting and statistical detail to be required and maintained in accounting for estimated costs has been and continues to be a matter to be decided by Government procurement authorities on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances.
