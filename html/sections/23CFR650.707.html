[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC02.010   The lower the rating factor, the higher the priority for selection and  funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The terms in the rating factor are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SR is Sufficiency Rating computed as illustrated in appendix A  of the Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and  Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges, USDOT/FHWA (latest edition); (If SR  is less than 1.0, use SR=1.0);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ADT is Average Daily Traffic in thousands taking the most  current value from the national bridge inventory data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ADTT is Average Daily Truck Traffic in thousands (Pick up trucks  and light delivery trucks not included). For load posted bridges, the  ADTT furnished should be that which would use the bridge if traffic were  not restricted. The ADTT should be the annual average volume, not peak  or seasonal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> N is National Highway System Status. N=1 if not on the National  Highway System. N=1.5 if bridge carries a National Highway System road;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The last term of the rating factor expression includes the  State's unobligated balance of funds received under 23 U.S.C. 144 as of  June 30 preceding the date of calculation, and the total funds received  under 23 U.S.C. 144 for the last four fiscal years ending with the most  recent fiscal year of the FHWA's annual call for discretionary bridge  candidate submittals; (if unobligated HBRRP balance is less than $10  million, use zero balance);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> TPC is Total Project Cost in millions of dollars;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> HBRRP is Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ADT' is ADT plus ADTT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In order to balance the relative importance of candidate bridges  with very low (less than one) sufficiency ratings and very low ADT's  against candidate bridges with high ADT's, the minimum sufficiency  rating used will be 1.0. If the computed sufficiency rating for a  candidate bridge is less than 1.0, use 1.0 in the rating factor formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the unobligated balance of HBRRP funds for the State is less  than $10 million, the HBRRP modifier is 1.0. This will limit the effect  of the modifier on those States with small apportionments or those who  may be accumulating funds to finance a major bridge.
