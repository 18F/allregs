                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency is not required to refund the  Federal share of an overpayment made to a provider as required by Sec.   433.312(a) to the extent that the State is unable to recover the  overpayment because the provider has been determined bankrupt or out of  business in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must notify the provider that an overpayment exists  in any case involving a bankrupt or out-of-business provider and, if the  debt has not been determined uncollectable, take reasonable actions to  recover the overpayment during the 1-year recovery period in accordance  with policies prescribed by applicable State law and administrative  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overpayment debts that the State need not refund. Overpayments  are considered debts that the State is unable   to recover within the 1-year period following discovery if the following  criteria are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider has filed for bankruptcy, as specified in paragraph  (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provider has gone out of business and the State is unable to  locate the provider and its assets, as specified in paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bankruptcy. The agency is not required to refund to CMS the  Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period  following discovery, if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provider has filed for bankruptcy in Federal court at the  time of discovery of the overpayment or the provider files a bankruptcy  petition in Federal court before the end of the 1-year period following  discovery; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State is on record with the court as a creditor of the  petitioner in the amount of the Medicaid overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Out of business. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency is not required to refund to CMS  the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period  following discovery if the provider is out of business on the date of  discovery of the overpayment or if the provider goes out of business  before the end of the 1-year period following discovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A provider is considered to be out of business on the effective  date of a determination to that effect under State law. The agency  must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Document its efforts to locate the party and its assets. These  efforts must be consistent with applicable State policies and  procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make available an affidavit or certification from the  appropriate State legal authority establishing that the provider is out  of business and that the overpayment cannot be collected under State law  and procedures and citing the effective date of that determination under  State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A provider is not out of business when ownershp is transferred  within the State unless State law and procedures deem a provider that  has transferred ownership to be out of business and preclude collection  of the overpayment from the provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Circumstances requiring refunds. If the 1-year recovery period  has expired before an overpayment is found to be uncollectable under the  provisions of this section, if the State recovers an overpayment amount  under a court-approved discharge of bankruptcy, or if a bankruptcy  petition is denied, the agency must refund the Federal share of the  overpayment in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec.  433.320  of this subpart.
