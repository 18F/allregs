                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Categorization of commodity schools. Commodity schools are  schools that operate a nonprofit school food service in accordance with  7 CFR part 210, but receive additional donated food assistance rather  than the general cash payment available to them under Section 4 of the  Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). In  addition to requirements in this part relating to donated foods,  commodity schools must adhere to Federal regulations in 7 CFR part 210,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Value of donated foods for commodity schools. For participating  commodity schools, the distributing agency receives donated foods valued  at the sum of the national per-meal value and the value of the general  cash payment available to it under Section 4 of the Richard B. Russell  National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753), multiplied by the number of  reimbursable lunches served by commodity schools in the previous school  year. From the total value of donated food assistance for which it is  eligible, a commodity school may elect to receive up to 5 cents per meal  in cash to cover processing and handling expenses related to the use of  donated foods. In addition to Section 6 and Section 14 foods under the  Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1755 and  1762(a)), the distributing agency may also receive donated foods under  Section 32 (7 U.S.C. 612c), Section 416 (7 U.S.C. 1431), or Section 709  (7 U.S.C. 1446a-1), as available, for commodity schools.</p>
