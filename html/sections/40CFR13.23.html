                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The requirements below apply when EPA has been requested to collect  a   debt owed by an EPA employee to another Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Format for the request for recovery. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The creditor agency  must complete fully the appropriate claim form specified by OPM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The creditor agency must certify to EPA on the debt claim form:  The fact that the employee owes a debt; the date that the debt first  accrued; and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5  U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM and send it to the Director,  Financial Management Division (2734R), U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the collection is to be made in installments, the creditor  agency must also advise EPA of the number of installments to be  collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencement date of  the first installment, if a date other than the next established pay  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless the employee has consented in writing to the salary  deductions or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required  procedures and this information is attached to the claim form, the  creditor agency must indicate the actions it took under its procedures  for salary offset and the dates of such actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Processing of the claim by EPA--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incomplete claims. If EPA  receives an improperly completed claim form, the claim form and all  accompanying material will be returned to the requesting (creditor)  agency with notice that OPM procedures must be followed and a properly  completed claim form must be received before any salary offset can be  taken. The notice should identify specifically what is needed from the  requesting agency for the claim to be processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete claims. If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) of  this section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on the  next established pay period. EPA will not review the merits of the  creditor agency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity  of the debt as stated in the debt claim form. EPA will not assess a  handling or any other related charge to cover the cost of its processing  the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees separating from EPA before a debt to another agency is  collected--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employees separating from Government service. If an  employee begins separation action before EPA collects the total debt due  the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor agency  will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the  employee from EPA in accordance with Sec. 13.22(1);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, EPA will  certify to the creditor agency and the employee the total amount of  EPA's collection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If EPA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from  the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar  payments, it will forward a copy of the claim form to the agency  responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is  outstanding. EPA will also send a copy of the claim form to the creditor  agency so that it can file a certified claim against the payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees who transfer to another Federal agency. If an EPA  employee transfers to another Federal agency before EPA collects the  total amount due the creditor agency, the following actions will be  taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA will certify the total amount of the collection made on the  debt; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee's official personnel folder will be sent to the  new paying agency. (It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to  ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.)</p>
