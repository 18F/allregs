                            <p class="depth0">As soon as practicable after the conclusion of a hearing and the receipt of any proposed findings and conclusions timely submitted by the parties, the Administrative Law Judge shall make the initial decision in the case. The decision will include (a) a statement of findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and (b) an order of disbarment, suspension, or reprimand or an order of dismissal of the complaint. The Administrative Law Judge shall file the decision with the Director of Practice and shall transmit a copy to the respondent or the respondent's attorney of record. In the absence of an appeal to the Secretary, or review of the decision upon motion of the Secretary, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge will, without further proceedings, become the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury 30 days from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision.</p>
