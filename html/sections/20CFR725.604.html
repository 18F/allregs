If the court determines that the  order was made and served in accordance with law, and that such operator  or other employer or its officers or agents have failed to comply  therewith, the court shall enforce obedience to the order by writ of  injunction or by other proper process, mandatory or otherwise, to enjoin  upon such operator or other employer and its officers or agents  compliance with the order.</p>
