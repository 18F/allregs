                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to establish, to the extent possible, uniform and consistent personnel security investigative requirements. Accordingly, investigations exceeding established requirements are authorized only when mandated by statute, national regulations, or international agreement. In this

connection, there are certain Special Access programs originating at the national or international level that require personnel security investigations and procedures of a special nature. These programs and the special investigative requirements imposed by them are described in this section. A Special Access program is any program designed to control access, distribution, and protection of particularly sensitive information established pursuant to section 4-2 of Executive Order 12356 and prior Orders. Title 32 CFR part 159 governs the establishment of Departmental Special Access Programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). (1) The investigative requirements for access to SCI is an SBI (See paragraph 4, appendix A) including a NAC on the individual's spouse or cohabitant. When conditions indicate, additional investigation shall be conducted on the spouse of the individual and members of the immediate family (or other persons to whom the individual is bound by affection or obligation) to the extent necessary to permit a determination by the adjudication agency that the Personnel Security standards of DCID 1/14 are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A previous investigation conducted within the past five years which substantially meets the investigative requirements prescribed by this section may serve as a basis for granting access approval provided that there has been no break in the individual's military service, DoD civilian employment, or access to classified information under the Industrial Security Program greater than 12 months. The individual shall submit one copy of an updated PSQ covering the period since the completion of the last SBI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Single Integrated Operation Plan--Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI). The investigative requirement for access to SIOP-ESI is an SBI, including a NAC on the spouse and the individual's immediate family who are 18 years of age or over and who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Presidential support activities. (1) DoD Directive 5210.55 \1\ prescribes the policies and procedures for the nomination, screening, selection, and continued evaluation of DoD military and civilian personnel and contractor employees assigned to or utilized in Presidential Support activities. The type of investigation of individuals assigned to Presidential Support activities varies according to whether the person investigated qualifies for Category One or Category Two as indicated below:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Category one. (A) Personnel assigned on a permanent or full-time basis to duties in direct support of the President (including the office staff of the Director, White House Military Office, and all individuals under his control):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Presidential aircrew and associated maintenance and security personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personnel assigned to the White House communications activities and the Presidential retreat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> White House transportation personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Presidential mess attendants and medical personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other individuals filling administrative positions at the White House.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Personnel assigned on a temporary or part-time basis to duties supporting the President:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Military Social Aides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selected security, transportation, flight-line safety, and baggage personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Others with similar duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Personnel assigned to the Office of the Military Aide to the Vice President.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Category two. (A) Personnel assigned to honor guards, ceremonial units, and military bands who perform at Presidential functions and facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employees of contractors who provide services or contractors employees who require unescorted access to Presidential Support areas, activities, or equipment--including maintenance of the Presidential retreat, communications, and aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Individuals in designated units requiring a lesser degree of access to the President or Presidential Support activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personnel nominated for Category One duties must have been the subject of an SBI, including a NAC on the

spouse and all members of the individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The SBI must have been completed within the 12 months preceding selection for Presidential Support duties. If such an individual marries subsequent to the completion of the SBI, the required spouse check shall be made at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Personnel nominated for Category Two duties must have been the subject of a BI, including a NAC on the spouse and all members of the individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The BI must have been completed within the 12 months preceding selection for Presidential Support duties. It should be noted that duties (separate and distinct from their Presidential Support responsibilities) of some Category Two personnel may make it necessary for them to have special access clearances which require an SBI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The U.S. citizenship of foreign-born immediate family members of all Presidential Support nominees must be verified by investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A limited number of Category One personnel having especially sensitive duties have been designated by the Director, White House Military Office as ``Category A.'' These personnel shall be investigated under special scoping in accordance with the requirements of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director, White House Military Office and the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, July 30, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). (1) DoD Directive 5210.42 \1\ sets forth the standards of individual reliability required for personnel performing duties associated with nuclear weapons and nuclear components.

On the basis of such information, the certifying official shall determine whether to continue or to withdraw the interim certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Controlled position: DNACI/NACI. (A) An ENTNAC completed for the purpose of first term enlistment or induction into the Armed Forces does not satisfy this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interim certification is authorized for an individual who has not had a DNACI/NACI completed within the past 5 years, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual has had a favorable ENTNAC/NAC, or higher investigation, that is more than 5 years old and has not had a break in service or employment in excess of 1 year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A DNACI/NACI has been requested at the time of interim certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All other requirements of the PRP screening process have been fulfilled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Should the DNACI/NACI not be completed within 90 days from the date of the request, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(G) of this section for ascertaining the delay of the investigation in the case of a critical position shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional requirements apply. (A) The investigation upon which certification is based must have been completed within the last 5 years from the date of initial assignment to a PRP position and there must not have been a break in service or employment in excess of 1 year between completion of the investigation and initial assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In those cases in which the investigation was completed more than 5 years prior to initial assignment or in which there has been a break in service or employment in excess of 1 year subsequent to completion of the investigation, a reinvestigation is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Subsequent to initial assignment to the PRP, reinvestigation is not required so long as the individual remains in the PRP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A medical evaluation of the individual as set forth in DoD Directive 5210.42.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Review of the individual's personnel file and other official records and information locally available concerning behavior or conduct which is relevant to PRP standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A personal interview with the individual for the purpose of informing him of the significance of the assignment, reliability standards, the need for reliable performance, and of ascertaining his attitude with respect to the PRP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Service in the Army, Navy and Air Force Reserve does not constitute active service for PRP purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Access to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) classified information. (1) Personnel assigned to a NATO staff position requiring access to NATO Cosmic (Top Secret), Secret, or Confidential information shall have been the subject of a favorably adjudicated BI (10 year scope), DNACI/NACI or NAC/ENTNAC, current within five years prior to the assignment, in accordance with USSAN Instruction 1-69 and Sec. 154.19(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personnel not assigned to a NATO staff position, but requiring access to NATO Cosmic, Secret or Confidential information in the normal course of their duties, must possess the equivalent final U.S. security clearance based upon the appropriate personnel security investigation (appendix A) required by Secs. 154.16(b) and 154.19(j) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other special access programs.
