                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each lubrication system must function properly in the  flight attitudes and atmospheric conditions in which an aircraft is  expected to operate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oil strainer or filter. There must be an oil strainer or filter  through which all of the engine oil flows. In addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has a  bypass must be constructed and installed so that oil will flow at the  normal rate through the rest of the system with the strainer or filter  element completely blocked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type and degree of filtering necessary for protection of the  engine oil system against foreign particles in the oil must be  specified. The applicant must demonstrate that foreign particles passing  through the specified filtering means do not impair engine oil system  functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must have the  capacity (with respect to operating limitations established for the  engine) to ensure that engine oil system functioning is not impaired  with the oil contaminated to a degree (with respect to particle size and  density) that is greater than that established for the engine in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each strainer or filter required by this paragraph, except  the strainer or filter at the oil tank outlet, there must be means to  indicate contamination before it reaches the capacity established in  accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any filter bypass must be designed and constructed so that the  release of collected contaminants is minimized by appropriate location  of the bypass to ensure that the collected contaminants are not in the  bypass flow path.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has no  bypass, except the strainer or filter at an oil tank outlet or for a  scavenge pump,   must have provisions for connection with a warning means to warn the  pilot of the occurance of contamination of the screen before it reaches  the capacity established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must be  accessible for draining and cleaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oil tanks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each oil tank must have an expansion space of not  less than 10 percent of the tank capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It must be impossible to inadvertently fill the oil tank  expansion space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each recessed oil tank filler connection that can retain any  appreciable quantity of oil must have provision for fitting a drain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each oil tank cap must provide an oil-tight seal. For an  applicant seeking eligibility for an engine to be installed on an  airplane approved for ETOPS, the oil tank must be designed to prevent a  hazardous loss of oil due to an incorrectly installed oil tank cap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each oil tank filler must be marked with the word ``oil.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each oil tank must be vented from the top part of the expansion  space, with the vent so arranged that condensed water vapor that might  freeze and obstruct the line cannot accumulate at any point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> There must be means to prevent entrance into the oil tank or  into any oil tank outlet, of any object that might obstruct the flow of  oil through the system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> There must be a shutoff valve at the outlet of each oil tank,  unless the external portion of the oil system (including oil tank  supports) is fireproof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Each unpressurized oil tank may not leak when subjected to a  maximum operating temperature and an internal pressure of 5 p.s.i., and  each pressurized oil tank must meet the requirements of Sec. 33.64.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Leaked or spilled oil may not accumulate between the tank and  the remainder of the engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Each oil tank must have an oil quantity indicator or provisions  for one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> If the propeller feathering system depends on engine oil--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There must be means to trap an amount of oil in the tank if the  supply becomes depleted due to failure of any part of the lubricating  system other than the tank itself;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of trapped oil must be enough to accomplish the  feathering opeation and must be available only to the feathering pump;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provision must be made to prevent sludge or other foreign  matter from affecting the safe operation of the propeller feathering  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Oil drains. A drain (or drains) must be provided to allow safe  drainage of the oil system. Each drain must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be accessible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have manual or automatic means for positive locking in the  closed position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Oil radiators. Each oil radiator must withstand, without  failure, any vibration, inertia, and oil pressure load to which it is  subjected during the block tests.
