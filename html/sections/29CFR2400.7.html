If the Privacy Officer determines  that access could have an adverse effect on the requester, OSHRC shall  notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can  be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation.  Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the  physician, and agreement by the physician to review the documents with  the requesting individual, to explain the meaning of the documents, and  to offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction, OSHRC shall  forward such records to the designated physician.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, within sixty (60) days of OSHRC's written request for a  designation, the requester has failed to respond or designate a  physician, or the physician fails to agree to the release conditions,  then OSHRC shall hold the documents in abeyance and advise the requester  that this action may be construed as a technical denial. OSHRC shall  also advise the requester of his rights to administrative appeal and  thereafter judicial review in a district court of the United States.</p>
