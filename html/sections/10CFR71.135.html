                            <p class="depth0">The licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC shall  maintain sufficient written records to describe the activities affecting  quality. The records must include the instructions, procedures, and  drawings required by Sec. 71.111 to prescribe quality assurance  activities and must include closely related specifications such as  required qualifications of personnel, procedures, and equipment. The  records must include the instructions or procedures which establish a  records retention program that is consistent with applicable regulations  and designates factors such as duration, location, and assigned  responsibility. The licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a  CoC shall retain these records for 3 years beyond the date when the  licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC last engage in the  activity for which the quality assurance program was developed. If any  portion of the written procedures or instructions is superseded, the  licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC shall retain the  superseded material for 3 years after it is superseded.</p>
