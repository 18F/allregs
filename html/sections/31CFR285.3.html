                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Debt as used in this section is synonymous with the term past-due  support unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth2">Debtor as used in this section means a person who owes past-due  support.</p><p class="depth2">Fiscal Service means the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a bureau of  the Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth2">HHS means the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of  Child Support Enforcement.</p><p class="depth2">IRS means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department  of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth2">Past-due support means the amount of support, determined under a  court order, or an order of an administrative process established under  State law, for support and maintenance of a child,   or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living, which has  not been paid, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 664(c).</p><p class="depth2">State means the several States of the United States. The term  ``State'' also includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam,  the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth2">Tax refund offset means withholding or reducing a tax refund payment  by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the payee(s) of a tax  refund payment.</p><p class="depth2">Tax refund payment means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be  refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the  appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402- 3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any Federal tax on the part of the  person who made the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Past-due support will be collected by tax  refund offset upon notification to Fiscal Service in accordance with 26  U.S.C. 6402(c), 42 U.S.C. 664 and this section. Collection by offset  under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) is a collection procedure separate from the  collection procedures provided by 26 U.S.C. 6305 and 26 CFR 301.6305-1,  relating to the assessment and collection of certain child and spousal  support liabilities. Tax refund offset may be used separately or in  conjunction with the collection procedures provided in 26 U.S.C. 6305,  as well as other collection procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as  certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service.  A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is  used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name of a payment certification record are  the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a delinquent  debtor record. When a match occurs and all other requirements for tax  refund offset have been met, Fiscal Service will reduce the amount of  any tax refund payment payable to a debtor by the amount of any past-due  support debt owed by the debtor. Any amounts not offset will be paid to  the payee(s) listed in the payment certification record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of past-due support--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Past-due support eligible  for tax refund offset. Past-due support qualifies for tax refund offset  if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> There has been an assignment of the support obligation to a  State and the amount of past-due support is not less than $25.00, or  such higher amount as HHS rules may allow, whichever is greater; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A State agency is providing support collection services under 42  U.S.C. 654(4) and the amount of the past-due support is not less than  $500.00; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A notification of liability for past-due support has been  received by Fiscal Service as prescribed by paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification of liability for past-due support and transmission  of information to Fiscal Service by HHS. States notifying HHS of past- due support shall do so in the manner and format prescribed by HHS. The  notification of liability shall be accompanied by a certification that  the State has complied with the requirements contained in paragraph  (c)(4) of this section and with any requirements applicable to the  offset of Federal tax refunds to collect past-due support imposed by  State law or procedures. HHS shall consolidate and transmit to Fiscal  Service the information contained in the notifications of liability for  past-due support submitted by the States provided that the State has  certified that the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section have  been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of liability for past-due support transmitted  directly to Fiscal Service by States. States must notify HHS of past-due  support in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section unless HHS rules authorize notification to Fiscal Service  directly. If authorized by HHS rules, States may notify Fiscal Service  directly of past-due support. States notifying Fiscal Service directly  of past-due support shall do so in the manner and format prescribed by  Fiscal Service. The notification of liability shall be accompanied by a  certification that the State has complied with the requirements  contained in paragraph   (c)(4) of this section and with any requirements applicable to the  offset of Federal tax refunds to collect past-due support imposed by  State law or procedures. Fiscal Service may reject a notification of  past-due support which does not comply with the requirements of this  section. Upon notification of the rejection and the reason for  rejection, the State may resubmit a corrected notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advance notification to debtor of intent to collect by tax  refund offset. The State, or HHS if the State requests and HHS agrees,  is required to provide a written notification to the debtor, pursuant to  the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 664(a)(3) and 45 CFR 303.72(e), informing  the debtor that the State intends to refer the debt for collection by  tax refund offset. The notice also shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Instruct the debtor of the steps which may be taken to contest  the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of  the past-due support;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advise any non-debtor who may file a joint tax return with the  debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to  secure his or her proper share of the tax refund; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In cases when a debt is being enforced by more than one State,  advise the debtor of his or her opportunities to request a review with  the State enforcing collection or the State issuing the support order as  prescribed by the provisions of 45 CFR 303.72(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Correcting and updating notification. The State shall, in the  manner and in the time frames provided by Fiscal Service or HHS, notify  Fiscal Service or HHS of any deletion or net decrease in the amount of  past-due support referred to Fiscal Service, or HHS as the case may be,  for collection by tax refund offset. The State may notify Fiscal Service  or HHS of any increases in the amount of the debt referred to Fiscal  Service for collection by tax refund offset provided that the State has  complied with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section with  regard to those debts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Collection of past-due support enforced by multiple States. When  a State has knowledge that the debt is being enforced by more than one  State, the State notifying Fiscal Service, or HHS as the case may be, of  the debt shall inform any such other State involved in enforcing the  debt when it receives the offset amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Priorities for offset. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402, a tax  refund payment shall be reduced in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First, by the amount of any past-due support which is to be  offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) and 42 U.S.C. 464;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second, by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt  owed to a Federal agency which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(d),  31 U.S.C. 3720A and Sec. 285.2 of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third, by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt  owed to States (other than past-due support) which is to be offset under  26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or 26 U.S.C. 6402(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduction of the tax refund payment pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  6402(a), (c), (d), and (e) shall occur prior to crediting the  overpayment to any future liability for an internal revenue tax. Any  amount remaining after tax refund offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c),  (d), and (e) shall be refunded to the taxpayer, or applied to estimated  tax, if elected by the taxpayer pursuant to IRS regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Post-offset notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fiscal Service shall notify the  debtor in writing of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount and date of the offset to satisfy past-due support;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The State to which this amount has been paid or credited; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A contact point within the State that will handle concerns or  questions regarding the offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section also will  advise any non-debtor who may have filed a joint tax return with the  debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to  secure his or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Service will advise HHS of the names, mailing addresses,  and identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due  support were collected, of the amounts collected from each debtor  through tax refund offset, the names of any non-debtor spouses who may  have filed a joint return with the debtor, and of the   State on whose behalf each collection was made. Alternatively, Fiscal  Service will provide such information to each State that refers debts  directly to Fiscal Service. Fiscal Service will inform HHS and each  State that the payment source is a tax refund payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names  and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts owed  for past-due support were collected from tax refund offsets and the  amounts collected from each debtor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At such time and in such manner as Fiscal Service and HHS agree,  but no less than annually, Fiscal Service will advise HHS of the States  which have furnished notices of past-due support, the number of cases in  each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the  amount of past-due support sought to be collected by each State, and the  amount of such tax refund offset collections actually made in the case  of each State. As Fiscal Service and HHS may agree, Fiscal Service may  provide additional offset-related information about States which have  furnished notices of past-due support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Offset made with regard to a tax refund payment based upon joint  return. If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the  past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper  share of a tax refund from which an offset was made, the IRS will pay  the person his or her share of the refund and request that Fiscal  Service deduct that amount from amounts payable to HHS or the State, as  the case may be. Fiscal Service and HHS, or the appropriate State, will  adjust their debtor records accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of amounts collected. Fiscal Service will transmit  amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (h) of  this section, to HHS or to the appropriate State. If Fiscal Service  learns that an erroneous offset payment is made to HHS or any State,  Fiscal Service will notify HHS or the appropriate State that an  erroneous offset payment has been made. Fiscal Service may deduct the  amount of the erroneous offset payment from amounts payable to HHS or  the State, as the case may be. Alternatively, upon Fiscal Service'  request, the State shall return promptly to the affected taxpayer or  Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment  (unless the State previously has paid such amounts, or any portion of  such amounts, to the affected taxpayer). HHS and States shall notify  Fiscal Service any time HHS or a State returns an erroneous offset  payment to an affected taxpayer. Fiscal Service and HHS, or the  appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees. The State will pay a fee to Fiscal Service for the full  cost of administering the tax refund offset program. The fee (not to  exceed $25 per case submitted) will be established annually in such  amount as Fiscal Service and HHS agree to be sufficient to reimburse  Fiscal Service for the full cost of the offset procedure. Fiscal Service  will deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to disposition and  transmit a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the IRS for its  share of the cost of administering the tax refund offset program. Fees  will be charged only for actual tax refund offsets completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Review of tax refund offsets. In accordance with 26 U.S.C.  6402(f), any reduction of a taxpayer's refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  6402(c), (d), or (e) shall not be subject to review by any court of the  United States or by the Secretary of the Treasury, Fiscal Service or IRS  in an administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United  States to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be  a suit for refund of tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Access to and use of confidential tax information. Access to and  use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund  offset program is permitted to the extent necessary in establishing  appropriate agency records, locating any person with respect to whom a  reduction under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) is sought for purposes of collecting  the debt, and in the defense of any litigation or administrative  procedure ensuing from a reduction made under section 6402(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Effective date. This section applies to tax refund payments  payable under 26 U.S.C. 6402 after January 1, 1999.  [63 FR 72094, Dec. 30, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 59480, Oct. 22, 2007;  74 FR 27433, June 10, 2009]</p>
