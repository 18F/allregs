                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each CMF grant is expected to result in Eligible Project Costs that total at least 10 times the grant amount. Such costs may be for activities that

include Affordable Housing Activities, Economic Development Activities, or Community Service Facilities. Thus, an Awardee shall demonstrate that it leveraged, over its CMF funded portfolio, its CMF award at least 10 times the CMF grant amount or some other standard established by the CDFI Fund in the Awardee's Assistance Agreement. Leveraged Costs are costs that exceed the dollar amount of the Awardee's CMF contribution to each CMF-funded activity. However, the applicable NOFA may set forth a required percentage of Leveraged Costs that must be attributable to non-governmental sources. An Awardee may report to the CDFI Fund all Leveraged Costs, with the following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No costs attributable to Operations may be reported as Leveraged Costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No costs attributable to prohibited uses as identified in Sec.  1807.302(a) and (c) may be reported as Leveraged Costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All costs attributable to Affordable Housing Activities reported as Leveraged Costs must be for housing units that qualify as Affordable Housing under Sec.  1807.401 or Sec.  1807.402 for Eligible-Income Families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Awardees shall self-report leveraging information through forms or electronic systems developed by the CDFI Fund, subject to audit requirements set forth herein. Consequently, Awardees shall maintain appropriate documentation, such as audited financial statements, wire transfers documents, pro-formas, and other relevant records, to support its reports.</p>
