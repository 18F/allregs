Any information or  material submitted that is identified as national security classified  must be accompanied at the time of filing by a statement indicating the  degree of classification, the authority for the classification, and the  identity of the classifying entity. By submitting information or  material identified as business confidential, the applicant or other  party represents that the information is exempted from public  disclosure, either by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552 et  seq.) or by some other specific statutory exemption. Any request for  business confidential treatment must be accompanied at the time of  filing by a statement justifying non-disclosure and referring to the  specific legal authority claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department may refuse to accept as business confidential any  information or material it considers not intended to be protected under  the legal authority claimed by the applicant, or under other applicable  legal authority. Any such information or material so refused shall be  promptly returned to the submitter and will not be considered. However,  such information or material may be resubmitted as non-confidential in  which case it will be made part of the public record.</p>
