                            <p class="depth0">The Lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and for taking all servicing actions that a reasonable Lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The guarantee is unenforceable by the Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, use of loan funds for unauthorized purposes, Negligent Loan Servicing or Grossly Negligent Loan Servicing as established in the Loan Note Guarantee, or failure to maintain the required security interest regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. The Lender may contract for services and may rely on certain written materials (including but not limited to certifications, evaluations, appraisals, financial statements and other reports) to be provided by the Borrower or other qualified third parties (including, among others, one or more independent engineers, appraisers, accountants, consultants or other experts) but is ultimately responsible for underwriting, loan origination, loan servicing, and compliance with all Agency regulations. The Lender's Agreement is the contractual agreement between the Lender and the Agency that sets forth some of the Lender's loan servicing responsibilities. This responsibility includes but is not limited to periodic Borrower visits, the collection of payments, obtaining compliance with the covenants and provisions in the Loan Agreement, obtaining and analyzing financial statements, ensuring payment of taxes and insurance premiums, and maintaining liens on Collateral, and keeping an inventory accounting of all Collateral items and reconciling the inventory of all Collateral sold during loan servicing, including liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Periodic reports. Each Lender must submit reports by the end of each Calendar Quarter, unless more frequent ones are needed as determined by the Agency to meet the financial interests of the United States, regarding the condition of its Agency guaranteed

loan portfolio (including Borrower status and Loan Classification) and any Material Adverse Change in the general financial condition of the Borrower since the last report was submitted. The Lender must report the outstanding principal and Interest balance and the current Loan Classification on each guaranteed loan using either the USDA Lender Interactive Network Connection (LINC) system or Form RD 1980-41, ``Guaranteed Loan Status Report.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Default reports. Lenders must submit monthly Default reports, including Borrower payment history, for each loan in monetary Default using a form approved by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual Renewal Fee. The Lender must transmit the Annual Renewal Fee to the Agency in accordance with Sec. 4279.231(b) of this chapter calculated based on the December 31 loan status report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency and Lender conference. At the Agency's request, the Lender must consult with the Agency to ascertain how the guaranteed loan is being serviced and that the conditions and covenants of the Loan Agreement are being enforced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Borrower Financial reports. The Lender must obtain, analyze, and forward to the Agency the Borrower's and any guarantor's financial statements required by the Loan Agreement within 45 days of the end of each Calendar Quarter and audited financial statements within 180 days of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year. The Lender must analyze these financial statements and provide the Agency with a written summary of the Lender's analysis, ratio analysis, and conclusions, which, at a minimum, must include trends, strengths, weaknesses, extraordinary transactions, violations of loan covenants and covenant waivers proposed by the Lender, any routine servicing actions performed, and other indications of the financial condition of the Borrower. Spreadsheets of the financial statements must also be included. Following the Agency's review of the Lender's financial analysis, the Agency will provide a written report of any concerns to the Lender. Any concerns based upon the Agency's review must be addressed by the Lender. If the Lender makes a reasonable attempt to obtain financial statements, but is unable to obtain the Borrower's cooperation, the failure to obtain financial statements will not impair the validity of the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Audits. Any Public Body, nonprofit corporation or Indian Tribe that receives a guaranteed loan that meets the thresholds established by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must provide an audit for the fiscal year (of the borrower) in which the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. If the loan is for development or purchases made in a previous fiscal year through interim financing, an audit will also be provided for the fiscal year in which the development or purchases occurred. Any audit provided by a Public Body, nonprofit corporation, or Indian Tribe in accordance with this paragraph (f) will be considered adequate to meet the audit requirements of the Program for that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Protection of Agency interests. If the Agency determines that the Lender is not in compliance with its servicing responsibilities, the Agency reserves the right to take any action the Agency determines necessary to protect the Agency's interests with respect to the loan. If the Agency exercises this right, the Lender must cooperate with the Agency to rectify the situation. In determining any loss, the Agency will assess against the Lender any cost to the Agency associated with such action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional loans. The Lender must notify the Agency in writing when the Lender makes any additional expenditures or new loans to the Borrower. The Lender may make additional expenditures or new loans to a Borrower with an outstanding loan guaranteed only with prior written Agency approval. The Agency will only approve additional expenditures or new loans where the expenditure or loan will not violate one or more of the loan covenants of the Borrower's Loan Agreement. Any additional expenditure or loan made by the Lender must be junior in priority to the BAP loan guaranteed under 7 CFR part 4279 except for Working Capital loans for which the Agency may consider a subordinate lien provided it is consistent with the conditional provisions specified in

Sec. 4279.235(a) of this chapter and in Sec. 4287.323.
