Sec. 190.02(f)(1) and 190.03(b)(5), the trustee must use its best efforts to prevent property which is to be delivered for or on behalf of a customer to fulfill that contract, or property for which delivery is being taken with respect to a customer pursuant to that contract, from becoming part of the debtor's estate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event that the trustee is unable to liquidate an open commodity contract subject to physical delivery or an option on a physical commodity, which cannot be settled in cash, prior to the last day of trading in that contract as required by Sec.
