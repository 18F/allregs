                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority and scope. The Illinois State Plan for Public Employee  Occupational Safety and Health received initial OSHA approval on  September 1, 2009. The Plan designates the Illinois Department of Labor  as the State agency responsible for administering the Plan throughout  the State. The Plan includes as enabling legislation the Illinois Safety  Inspection and Education Act (SIEA) [820 ILCS 220] and the Illinois  Health and Safety Act (HSA) [820 ILCS 225]. Under the legislation, the  State Director of Labor has full authority to adopt, enforce and  administer all laws and rules protecting the safety and health of all  employees of the State and its political subdivisions under the Illinois  Public Employee Only State Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards. Illinois has adopted State standards identical to  OSHA occupational safety and health standards promulgated through  September 30, 2005. The State Plan provides that these standards will be  updated within one year of plan approval and future OSHA standards and  revisions will be adopted by the State within six months of Federal  promulgation, in accordance with 29 CFR 1953.5. Any emergency temporary  standards will be adopted within 30 days of Federal adoption. The State  will adopt Federal OSHA standards in accordance with the provisions of  the Illinois Health and Safety Act [820 ILCS 225/4.1]. The Plan also  provides for the adoption of alternative or different occupational  safety and health standards by the Director of Labor, where no Federal  standards are applicable to the conditions or circumstances or where  standards more stringent than Federal are deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Variances. The Plan includes provisions for the granting of  permanent and temporary variances from State standards in terms  substantially similar to the variance provisions contained in the OSH  Act. The State provisions require employee notification   of variance applications as well as employee rights to participate in  hearings held on variance applications. Variances may not be granted  unless it is established that adequate protection is afforded employees  under the terms of the variance. The State has committed to amend its  current variance procedures at 56 ILAC 350.40 to bring them into  conformance with Federal procedures at 29 CFR 1905 within two years of  plan approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee notice and discrimination protection. The Plan provides  for notification to employees of their protections and obligations under  the Plan by such means as the State poster and required posting of  notices of violations. The Plan also provides for protection of  employees against discharge or discrimination resulting from exercise of  their rights under the State's Acts in terms similar to section 11(c) of  the OSH Act. The SIEA provides that an employee who believes that he or  she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person  in violation of this section may, within 30 calendar days after the  violation occurs, file a complaint with the Director of Labor alleging  the discrimination. The Plan provides that the Director shall  investigate such complaints as appropriate and make a determination  within 90 days. If the Director determines that the provisions of this  section have been violated, the Director shall bring an action in the  circuit court for appropriate relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspections and enforcement. The Plan provides for inspection of  covered workplaces, including inspections in response to employee  complaints by the Department of Labor. If a determination is made that  an employee complaint does not warrant an inspection, the complainant  shall be notified, in writing, of such determination and afforded an  opportunity to seek informal review of the determination. The Plan  provides the opportunity for employer and employee representatives to  accompany the inspector during an inspection for the purpose of aiding  in the inspection and in the absence of such a representative, the right  to interview a reasonable number of employees during the inspection. The  Plan also provides for the right of entry for inspection and prohibition  of advance notice of inspection. The Director of Labor is responsible  for all enforcement actions, including the issuance of all citations  which must specify the abatement period, posting requirements, and the  employer's and employees' right to contest any or all citations.  Although the Plan contains authority for a system of first-instance  monetary penalties, in practice it is the State's intent to issue  monetary penalties only for failure to correct and egregious violations.  The State has discretionary authority for civil penalties of not more  than $10,000 for repeat and willful violations. Serious and other-than- serious violations may be assessed a penalty of up to $1,000 per  violation and failure-to-correct violations may be assessed a penalty of  up to $1,000 per violation per day. In addition, any public employer who  willfully violates any standard, rule, or order can be charged by the  Attorney General with a Class 4 felony if that violation causes death to  any employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review procedures. Although the Director has statutory  responsibility for both the enforcement and the appeals process (820  ILCS 220/2.4), in practice, Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) hear  contested cases without any oversight or review by the Director. The  State will make appropriate changes to its regulations and procedures to  ensure the separation of these functions and the independence of the  adjudicatory process within one year of plan approval. The Director of  Labor will remain responsible for the enforcement process, including the  issuance of citations and penalties, and their defense, if contested.  Public employers or their representatives who receive a citation or a  proposed penalty may within 15 working days contest the citation,  proposed penalty and/or abatement period and request a hearing before an  Administrative Law Judge. Any public employee or representative may  within 15 working days request a hearing before an ALJ regarding the  reasonableness of the abatement period. Informal review prior to contest  may also be requested at the division level. The ALJ's decision is  subject to appeal to the courts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Staffing and resources. The Plan further provides assurances of  a fully   trained, adequate staff within three years of plan approval, including  11 safety and 3 health compliance officers for enforcement inspections,  and 3 safety and 2 health consultants to perform consultation services  in the public sector. The State has assured that it will continue to  provide a sufficient number of adequately trained and qualified  personnel necessary for the enforcement of standards as required by 29  CFR 1956.10. The State has also given satisfactory assurance of adequate  funding to support the Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records and reports. The Plan provides that public employers in  Illinois will maintain appropriate records and make timely reports on  occupational injuries and illnesses in a manner substantially identical  to that required for private sector employers under Federal OSHA.  Illinois has assured that it will coordinate with the Illinois  Department of Health to expand its participation in the Bureau of Labor  Statistics Annual Survey of Injuries and Illnesses to include public  sector employers. The State will comply with the provisions of 29 CFR  1904.7, which allow full employee and employee representative access,  including employee's names, to the log of workplace injuries and  illnesses; and will amend its recordkeeping regulations within two years  of plan approval. The Plan also contains assurances that the Director of  Labor will provide reports to OSHA in such form as the Assistant  Secretary may require, and that Illinois will participate in OSHA's  Integrated Management Information System as well as it successor, OSHA  Information System, once deployed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Voluntary compliance programs. The Plan provides that training  will be provided to public employers and employees; a separate on-site  consultation program in the public sector will be established to provide  services to public employers who request assistance; and all State  agencies and political subdivisions will be encouraged to develop and  maintain internal safety and health programs as an adjunct to, but not a  substitute for, the Director of Labor's enforcement.</p>
