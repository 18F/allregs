                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(4)(iii)</em> of this chapter for a critical access hospital. This  physician order must be present in the medical record and be supported  by the physician admission and progress notes, in order for the hospital  to be paid for hospital inpatient services under Medicare Part A. In  addition to these physician orders, inpatient rehabilitation facilities  also must adhere to the admission requirements specified in Sec.  412.622 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The order must be furnished by a qualified and licensed  practitioner who has admitting privileges at the hospital as permitted  by State law, and who is knowledgeable about the patient's hospital  course, medical plan of care, and current condition. The practitioner  may not delegate the decision (order) to another individual who is not  authorized by the State to admit patients, or has not been granted  admitting privileges applicable to that patient by the hospital's  medical staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The physician order must be furnished at or before the time of  the inpatient admission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, when  a patient enters a hospital for a surgical procedure not specified by  Medicare as inpatient only under Sec. 419.22(n) of this chapter, a  diagnostic test, or any other treatment, and the physician expects to  keep the patient in the hospital for only a limited period of time that  does not cross 2 midnights, the services are generally inappropriate for  inpatient admission and inpatient payment under Medicare Part A,  regardless of the hour that the patient came to the hospital or whether  the patient used a bed. Surgical procedures, diagnostic tests, and other  treatment are generally appropriate for inpatient admission and  inpatient hospital payment under Medicare Part A when the physician  expects the patient to require a stay that crosses at least 2 midnights.  The expectation of the physician should be based on such complex medical  factors as patient history and comorbidities, the severity of signs and  symptoms, current medical needs, and the risk of an adverse event. The  factors that lead to a particular clinical expectation must be  documented in the medical record in order to be granted consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an unforeseen circumstance, such as a beneficiary's death or  transfer, results in a shorter beneficiary stay than the physician's  expectation of at least 2 midnights, the patient may be considered to be  appropriately treated on an inpatient basis, and hospital inpatient  payment may be made under Medicare Part A.
