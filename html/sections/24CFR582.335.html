                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Minimizing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, recipients must assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of supportive housing assisted under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Relocation assistance for displaced persons. A displaced person (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Real property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real property for supportive housing is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Responsibility of recipient. (1) The recipient must certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with these provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid for with local public funds or funds available from other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The recipient must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Appeals. A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the recipient's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definition of displaced person. (1) For purposes of this section, the term ``displaced person'' means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property permanently as

a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for supportive housing project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A person that moves permanently from the real property after the property owner (or person in control of the site) issues a vacate notice or refuses to renew an expiring lease, if the move occurs on or after:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date that the recipient submits to HUD an application for assistance that is later approved and funded, if the recipient has control of the project site; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date that the recipient obtains control of the project site, if such control is obtained after the submission of the application to HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if the recipient or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves permanently from the building/complex on or after the date of the ``initiation of negotiations'' (see paragraph (g) of this section) if the move occurs before the tenant has been provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tenant's monthly rent before the initiation of negotiations and estimated average utility costs, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 30 percent of gross household income. If the initial rent is at or near the maximum, there must be a reasonable basis for concluding at the time the project is initiated that future rent increases will be modest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A tenant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A tenant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another unit in the same building/complex, if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local or tribal law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance provided under this section), if the project is approved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The recipient may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct

result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term ``initiation of negotiations'' means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD, or selection of the project site, if later.</p>
