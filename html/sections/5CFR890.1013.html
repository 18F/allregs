                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review factors. The factors OPM shall consider in deciding whether to propose a provider's debarment under a permissive debarment authority are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of any claims involved in the basis for the proposed debarment and the circumstances under which they were presented to FEHBP carriers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The improper conduct involved in the basis for the proposed debarment, and the provider's degree of culpability and history of prior offenses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent to which the provider poses or may pose a risk to the health and safety of FEHBP-covered individuals or to the integrity of FEHBP transactions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other factors specifically relevant to the provider's debarment that shall be considered in the interests of fairness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Absence of a factor. The absence of a factor shall be considered neutral, and shall have no effect on OPM's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specialized review in certain cases. In determining whether to propose debarment under 5 U.S.C 8902a(c)(4) for providing items or services substantially in excess of the needs of a covered individual or for providing items or services that fail to meet professionally-recognized quality standards, OPM shall obtain the input of trained reviewers, based on written medical protocols developed by physicians. If OPM cannot reach a decision on this basis, it shall consult with a physician in an appropriate specialty area.</p>
