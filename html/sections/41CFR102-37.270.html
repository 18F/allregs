                            <p class="depth0">Yes, you can retain surplus property for use in operating the donation program, but only if you have a cooperative agreement with GSA that allows you to do so. You must obtain prior GSA approval before using any surplus property in the operation of the SASP. Make your needs known by submitting a listing of needed property to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. GSA will review the list to ensure that it is of the type and quantity of property that is reasonably needed and useful in performing SASP operations. GSA will notify you within 30 calendar days whether you may retain the property for use in your operations. Title to any surplus property GSA approves for your retention will vest in your SASP. You must maintain separate records for such property.</p><p class="depth0">Service and Handling Charges</p>
