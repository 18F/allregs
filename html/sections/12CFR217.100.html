                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart E establishes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum qualifying criteria for Board-regulated institutions using institution-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Methodologies for such Board-regulated institutions to calculate their total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) This subpart applies to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This subpart applies to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A top-tier bank holding company or savings and loan holding company domiciled in the United States that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is not a consolidated subsidiary of another bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has total consolidated assets (excluding assets held by an insurance underwriting subsidiary), as defined on schedule HC-K of the FR Y-9C, equal to $250 billion or more;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure at the most recent year-end equal to $10 billion (excluding exposures held by an insurance underwriting subsidiary). Total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total cross-border claims less claims with head office or guarantor located in another country plus redistributed guaranteed amounts to the country of head office or guarantor plus local country claims on local residents plus revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products, calculated in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Country Exposure Report); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Has a subsidiary depository institution that is required, or has elected, to use 12 CFR part 3, subpart E (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or 12 CFR part 325, subpart E (FDIC) to calculate its risk-based capital requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A state member bank that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has total consolidated assets, as reported on the most recent year-end Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report), equal to $250 billion or more;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure at the most recent year-end equal to $10 billion or more (where total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total cross-border claims less claims with head office or guarantor located in another country plus redistributed guaranteed amounts to the country of head office or guarantor plus local country claims on local residents plus revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products, calculated in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Country Exposure Report);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses 12 CFR part 3, subpart E (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or 12 CFR part 325, subpart E (FDIC) to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any Board-regulated institution that elects to use this subpart to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its total risk-weighted assets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Elects to use this subpart to calculate its total risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A bank that is subject to this subpart shall remain subject to this subpart unless the Board determines in writing that application of this subpart is not appropriate in light of the Board-regulated institution's asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or scope of operations. In making a determination under this paragraph (b), the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A market risk Board-regulated institution must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Principle of conservatism. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, a Board-regulated institution may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Board-regulated institution can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the Board that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board-regulated institution appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board-regulated institution notifies the Board in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The exposures to which the Board-regulated institution applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the Board-regulated institution.
