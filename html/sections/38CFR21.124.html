                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A combination course is a course which combines training on the job with training in school. For the purpose of VA vocational rehabilitation, a course will be considered to be a combination course, if the student spends full-time on the job and one or more times a week also attends school on a part-tme basis. A veteran may pursue the components of a combination course in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Concurrent school and on-job training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Primarily on-job with some related instruction in school;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a school as a preparatory course to entering on-job training; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> First training on-job followed by the school portion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperative course. A cooperative course is a special type of combination course which usually:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has an objective which the student attains primarily through school instruction with the on-job portion being supplemental to the school course;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is at the college or junior college level although some cooperative courses are offered at post-secondary schools which do not offer a college degree or at secondary schools;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requires the student to devote at least one-half of the total training period to the school portion of the course; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Includes relatively long periods each of training on the job and in

school such as a full term in school followed by a full term on the job.
