                                Sec. 2.33  Responsibilities of DOL, DOL social service providers
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DOL, DOL social service intermediary providers, DOL social service providers in their use of direct DOL support, and State and local governments administering DOL support must not, when providing social services, discriminate for or against a current or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief. This requirement does not preclude DOL, DOL social service intermediary providers, or State or local governments administering DOL support from accommodating religion in a manner consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> DOL, DOL social service providers, and State and local governments administering DOL support must ensure that they do not use direct DOL support for inherently religious activities such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. DOL social service providers must be permitted to offer inherently religious activities so long as they offer those activities separately in time or location from social services receiving direct DOL support, and participation in the inherently religious activities is voluntary for the beneficiaries of social service programs receiving direct DOL support. For example, participation in an inherently religious activity must not be a condition for participating in a directly-supported social service program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOL, DOL social service providers, and State and local governments administering DOL support must ensure that they do not use direct DOL support for inherently religious activities such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. DOL social service providers must be permitted to offer inherently religious activities so long as they offer those activities separately in time or location from social services receiving direct DOL support, and participation in the inherently religious activities is voluntary for the beneficiaries of social service programs receiving direct DOL support. For example, participation in an inherently religious activity must not be a condition for participating in a directly-supported social service program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This regulation is not intended to and does not restrict the exercise of rights or duties guaranteed by the Constitution. For example, program officials must not impermissibly restrict the ability of program beneficiaries or DOL social service providers to freely express their views and to exercise their right to religious freedom. Additionally, subject to reasonable and permissible time, place and manner restrictions, residential facilities that receive DOL support must permit residents to engage in voluntary religious activities, including holding religious services, at these facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1), and to the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law (including constitutional requirements), direct DOL support may be used to support inherently religious activities, and such activities need not be provided separately in time or location from other DOL-supported activities, under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where DOL support is provided to chaplains to work with inmates in prisons, detention facilities, or community correction centers through social service programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where DOL support is provided to social service programs in prisons, detention facilities, or community correction centers, in which social service organizations assist chaplains in carrying out their duties; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where DOL-supported social service programs involve such a degree of government control over the program environment that religious exercise would be significantly burdened absent affirmative steps by DOL or its social service providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the restrictions set forth in this section regarding the use of direct DOL support do not apply to social service programs where DOL support is provided to a religious or other non-governmental organization indirectly within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Religious or other non-governmental organizations will be considered to have received support indirectly, for example, if as a result of a program beneficiary's genuine and independent choice the beneficiary redeems a voucher, coupon, or certificate that allows the beneficiary to choose the service provider, or some other mechanism is provided to ensure that beneficiaries have a genuine and independent choice among providers or program options. All organizations must, however, satisfy all applicable legal and programmatic requirements.</p>
