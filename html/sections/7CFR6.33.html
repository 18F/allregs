                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A fee will be assessed each quota year for each license to  defray the Department's costs of administering the licensing system. To  the extent practicable, the fee will be announced by the Licensing  Authority in a notice published in the Federal Register no later than  August 31 of the year preceding the quota year for which the fee is  assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, no later than 30 days from the date of  issuance of the license. Fee payments, if made by mail, shall be made by  certified check or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United  States. Fee payments, if made electronically, shall be made utilizing  the electronic software designated for the purpose by the Licensing  Authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the license fee is not paid by the final payment date, a hold  will be placed on the use of the license and no articles will be  permitted entry under that license. The Licensing Authority shall send a  warning letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, advising the  licensee that if payment is not mailed in accordance with Sec. 6.36(b)  or received within 21 days from the date of the letter, that the license  will be revoked. Where the license at issue is a historical license,  this will result, pursuant to Sec. 6.23(b), in the person's loss of  historical eligibility for such license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Licensees may elect not to accept certain licenses issued to  them; however, the Licensing Authority must be so notified by mail or  electronic e-mail, postmarked or electronically submitted in accordance  with Sec. 6.36(b) no later than May 1 of the year for which the license  is issued.
