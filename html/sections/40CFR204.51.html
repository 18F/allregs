This consists of an air compressor  (air end), and a reciprocating rotary or turbine engine rigidly  connected in permanent alignment and mounted on a common frame. Also  included are all cooling, lubricating, regulating, starting, and fuel  systems, and all equipment necessary to constitute a complete, self- contained unit with a rated capacity of 75 cfm or greater which delivers  air at pressures greater than 50 psig, but does not include any  pneumatic tools themselves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum Rated Capacity means that the portable air compressor,  operating at the design full speed with the compressor on load, delivers  its rated cfm output and pressure, as defined by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Model year means the manufacturer's annual production period  which includes January 1 of such calendar year; Provided, that if the  manufacturer has no annual production period, the term ``model year''  shall mean the calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compressor configuration means the basic classification unit of  a manufacturer's product line and is comprised of compressor lines,  models or series which are identical in all material respects with  regard to the parameters listed in Sec. 204.55-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Category means a group of compressor configurations which are  identical in all aspects with respect to the parameters listed in  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of Sec. 204.55-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Noise emission test means a test conducted pursuant to the  measurement methodology specified in Sec. 204.54.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Inspection Criteria means the rejection and acceptance numbers  associated with a particular sampling plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) means the maximum percentage of  failing compressors that, for purposes of sampling inspection can be  considered satisfactory as a process average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Batch means the collection of compressors of the same category  or configuration, as designated by the Administrator in a test request,  from which a batch sample is to be randomly drawn and inspected to  determine conformance with the acceptability criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Batch sample means the collection of compressors that are drawn  from a batch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Batch sample size means the number of compressors of the same  category or configuration which is randomly drawn from the batch sample  and which will receive emissions tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Test sample means the collection of compressors from the same  category or configuration which is randomly drawn from the batch sample  and which will receive emissions tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Batch size means the number, as designated by the Administrator  in the test request, of compressors of the same category or  configuration in a batch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Test sample size means the number of compressors of the same  configuration in a test sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Acceptable of a batch means that the number of non-complying  compressors in the batch sample is less than or equal to the acceptance  number as determined by the appropriate sampling plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Rejection of a batch means that the number of non-complying  compressors in the batch sample is greater than or equal to the  rejection number as determined by the appropriate sampling plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Acceptance of a batch sequence means that the number of rejected  batches in the sequence is less than or equal to the sequence acceptable  number as determined by the appropriate sampling plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Rejection of a batch sequence means that the number of rejected  batches in a sequence is greater than or equal to the sequence rejection  number as determined by the appropriate sampling plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Shift means the regular production work period for one group of  workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Failing compressor means that the measured noise emissions of  the compressor, when measured in accordance with the applicable  procedure, exceeds the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Acceptance of a compressor means that the measured noise  emissions of the compressor, when measured in accordance with the  applicable procedure, conforms to the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Test Compressor means a compressor used to demonstrate  compliance with the applicable noise emissions standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Tampering means those acts prohibited by section 10(a)(2) of the  Act.
