For assets other than revenue vehicles, the applicant is responsible for establishing a reasonable expected useful life. If the recipient does not intend to use the capital asset it is proposing to obtain by lease in mass transportation service for its entire expected useful life, when calculating the purchase cost, the recipient must calculate the fair market value of the asset as of the date the lease will terminate pursuant to Guidelines found in section 108(b) of part II Standard Terms and Conditions for valuation of property withdrawn from transit use before the end of its useful life and subtract that amount from the purchase price. The resulting amount is the purchase price for purposes of this rule.</p>
