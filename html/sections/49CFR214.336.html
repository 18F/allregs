                                Sec. 214.336  On-track safety procedures for certain roadway work
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedures; general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in  paragraph (e) of this section, on-track safety is required for each  adjacent controlled track when a roadway work group with at least one of  the roadway workers on the ground is engaged in a common task with on- track, self-propelled   equipment or coupled equipment on an occupied track. The required on- track safety shall be established through Sec. 214.319 (Working limits,  generally) or Sec. 214.329 (Train approach warning provided by watchmen/ lookouts) and as more specifically described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special circumstance arising in territories with at least three  tracks, if an occupied track is between two adjacent controlled tracks.  If an occupied track has two adjacent controlled tracks, and one of  these adjacent controlled tracks has one or more train or other on-track  equipment movements authorized or permitted at a speed of 25 mph or less  (or 40 mph or less for one or more passenger train or other passenger  on-track equipment movements), and the other adjacent controlled track  has one or more concurrent train or other on-track equipment movements  authorized or permitted at a speed over 25 mph (or over 40 mph for one  or more passenger train or other passenger on-track equipment  movements), the more restrictive procedures in paragraph (b) of this  section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">Adjacent controlled track means a controlled track whose track  center is spaced 19 feet or less from the track center of the occupied  track.</p><p class="depth0">Adjacent track means a controlled or non-controlled track whose  track center is spaced less than 25 feet from the track center of the  occupied track.</p><p class="depth0">Inter-track barrier means a continuous barrier of a permanent or  semi-permanent nature that spans the entire work area, that is at least  four feet in height, and that is of sufficient strength to prevent a  roadway worker from fouling the adjacent track.</p><p class="depth0">Minor correction means one or more repairs of a minor nature,  including, but not limited to, welding, spiking, anchoring, hand  tamping, and joint bolt replacement, that are accomplished with hand  tools or handheld, hand-supported, or hand-guided power tools. The term  does not include machine spiking, machine tamping, or any similarly  distracting repair.</p><p class="depth0">Occupied track means a track on which on-track, self-propelled  equipment or coupled equipment is authorized or permitted to be located  while engaged in a common task with a roadway work group with at least  one of the roadway workers on the ground.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for adjacent-controlled-track movements over 25 mph  (or over 40 mph if passenger movements). If a train or other on-track  equipment is authorized to move on an adjacent controlled track at a  speed greater than 25 mph, or at a speed greater than 40 mph for a  passenger train or other passenger on-track equipment movement, each  roadway worker in the roadway work group that is affected by such  movement must comply with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ceasing work and occupying a predetermined place of safety.  Except for the work activities as described in paragraph (e) of this  section, each affected roadway worker shall, as described in Table 1 of  this section, cease all on-ground work and equipment movement that is  being performed on or between the rails of the occupied track or on one  or both sides of the occupied track, and occupy a predetermined place of  safety upon receiving either a watchman/lookout warning or,  alternatively, a notification that the roadway worker in charge intends  to permit one or more train or other on-track equipment movements  through the working limits on the adjacent controlled track.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Resuming work. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An affected roadway worker may resume on- ground work and equipment movement (on or between the rails of the  occupied track or on one or both sides of the occupied track as  described in Table 1 of this section) only after the trailing-end of all  trains or other on-track equipment moving on the adjacent controlled  track (for which a warning or notification has been received in  accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section) has passed and remains  ahead of that roadway worker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the train or other on-track equipment stops before its  trailing-end has passed all of the affected roadway workers in the  roadway work group, the work to be performed (on or between the rails of  the occupied track or on one or both sides of the occupied track as  described in Table 1 of this section) ahead of the trailing-end of   the train or other on-track equipment on the adjacent controlled track  may resume only--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If on-track safety through train approach warning (Sec. 214.329)  has been established on the adjacent controlled track; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> After the roadway worker in charge has communicated with a  member of the train crew or the on-track equipment operator and  established that further movements of such train or other on-track  equipment shall be made only as permitted by the roadway worker in  charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for adjacent-controlled-track movements 25 mph or  less (or 40 mph or less if passenger movements). If a train or other on- track equipment is authorized or permitted to move on an adjacent  controlled track at a speed of 25 mph or less, or at a speed of 40 mph  or less for a passenger train or other passenger on-track equipment  movement, each roadway worker in the roadway work group that is affected  by such movement must comply with the procedures listed in paragraph (b)  of this section, except that equipment movement on the rails of the  occupied track and on-ground work performed exclusively between the  rails (i.e., not breaking the plane of the rails) of the occupied track  may continue, provided that no on-ground work is performed within the  areas 25 feet in front of and 25 feet behind any on-track, self- propelled equipment or coupled equipment permitted to move on the  occupied track.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Discretion of roadway worker in charge. Nothing in this subpart  prohibits the roadway worker in charge from establishing on-track safety  on one or more adjacent tracks as he or she deems necessary consistent  with both the purpose and requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions to certain requirements for adjacent-controlled-track  on-track safety. No on-track safety (other than that required by  paragraph (f) of this section or provided under paragraph (d) of this  section) is required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section for  an adjacent controlled track during the times that the roadway work  group is exclusively performing one or more of the following work  activities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On-ground work performed on a side of the occupied track meeting  specified condition(s). A roadway work group with all of its on-ground  roadway workers (other than those performing work in accordance with  another exception in paragraph (e) of this section) performing work  while exclusively positioned on a side of the occupied track as follows  and as further specified in Table 1 of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The side with no adjacent track;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The side with one or more adjacent tracks, the closest of which  has working limits on it and no movements permitted within such working  limits by the roadway worker in charge; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The side with one or more adjacent tracks, provided that that  it has an inter-track barrier between the occupied track and the closest  adjacent track on that side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance or repairs performed either alongside, or within the  perimeter of, a roadway maintenance machine or coupled equipment on the  occupied track. (i) One or more roadway workers performing maintenance  or repairs alongside a roadway maintenance machine or coupled equipment,  provided that such machine or equipment would effectively prevent the  worker from fouling the adjacent controlled track on the other side of  such equipment, and that such maintenance or repairs are performed while  positioned on a side of the occupied track as described in paragraph  (e)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) and Table 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, or (iii) and Table 1 of this section. A boom  or other equipment extending beyond the body of a roadway maintenance  machine or coupled equipment toward an adjacent controlled track is not  considered to be within the perimeter of the machine or coupled  equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iii)  of this section. If such a roadway work group (``excepted group'') is  authorized or permitted to operate on the same occupied track and within  the working limits of a separate roadway work group performing work that  is subject to the requirements of this section (``non-excepted group'')  or vice versa (i.e., a non-excepted group is authorized or permitted to  operate on the same occupied track and within the working limits of an  excepted group), the groups must conduct an on-track safety job briefing  to determine if adjacent-controlled-track on-track safety is necessary  for the excepted group. Such determination shall be made by the roadway  worker in charge of the working limits; however, if the groups are in  such proximity where the ability of the roadway workers in the excepted  group to hear or see approaching trains and other on-track equipment is  impaired by background noise, lights, sight obstructions or any other  physical conditions caused by the equipment, then this exception does  not apply, and adjacent-controlled-track on-track safety must be  provided to both groups. This exception otherwise applies to work  activities involving one or more of the following types of equipment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A hi-rail vehicle or other rail-bound vehicle (other than a  catenary maintenance tower vehicle) being used for inspection or minor  correction purposes, provided that such vehicle is not coupled to one or  more railroad cars. In accordance with Sec. 214.315(a), where multiple  hi-rail or rail-bound vehicles being used for inspection or minor  correction are engaged in a common task, the on-track safety job  briefing shall include discussion of the nature of the work to be  performed to determine if adjacent-controlled-track on-track safety is  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An automated inspection car being used for inspection or minor  correction purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A catenary maintenance tower car or vehicle, provided that all  of the on-ground workers engaged in the common task (other than those  performing work in accordance with another exception in paragraph (e) of  this section) are positioned within the gage of the occupied track for  the sole purpose of applying or removing grounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedures for components of roadway maintenance machines  fouling an adjacent controlled track. Except as provided for in  Sec. 214.341(c), a component of a roadway maintenance machine shall not  foul an adjacent controlled track unless working limits have been  established on the adjacent-controlled-track and there are no movements  permitted within the working limits by the roadway worker in charge that  would affect any of the roadway workers engaged in a common task with  such machine.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Summary of On-Track Safety Procedures for Certain Roadway Work Groups and Adjacent Tracks ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">``Side A'' of the occupied track--the  On or between the   ``Side B'' of the occupied track--</p><p class="depth0">side from the vertical plane of the      rails of the    either (1) the side with no adjacent</p><p class="depth0">near running rail of the occupied      occupied track      track or (2) the side from the</p><p class="depth0">track extending outward through to      (`` `No. 2'      vertical plane of the near running</p><p class="depth0">the fouling space of the adjacent        track'' or     rail of the occupied track extending</p><p class="depth0">Example number/   controlled track (`` `No. 1' Track''    ``number 2''),   outward through to the fouling space</p><p class="depth0">diagram number               or ``No. 1'')                where on-track   of the adjacent controlled track (``</p><p class="depth0">(see figure 1)  ---------------------------------------     Safety Is       `number 3' track'' or ``number 3'')</p><p class="depth0">Established</p><p class="depth0">through Working  -------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Method of On-Track     Requirement           Limits                            Method of on-</p><p class="depth0">Safety on Side A                     -------------------    Requirements     track safety on</p><p class="depth0">Requirements                             side B ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1...............

The</p><p class="depth0">PPOS may not be on a track, unless the track has working limits on it and no movements permitted within such</p><p class="depth0">working limits by the RWIC. Thus, under these circumstances, the space between the rails of the occupied track</p><p class="depth0">(No. 2 in this table) may be designated as a place to remain in position or to otherwise occupy upon receiving</p><p class="depth0">a warning or notification.
