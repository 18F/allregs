                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exemption for small issuers. (1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, Sec. Sec.  235.3, 235.4, and 235.6 do not apply to an interchange transaction fee received or charged by an issuer with respect to an electronic debit transaction if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issuer holds the account that is debited; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer, together with its affiliates, has assets of less than $10 billion as of the end of the calendar year preceding the date of the electronic debit transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of issuer asset size. A person may rely on lists published by the Board to determine whether an issuer, together with its affiliates, has assets of less than $10 billion as of the end of the calendar year preceding the date of the electronic debit transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Change in status. If an issuer qualifies for the exemption in paragraph (a)(1) in a particular calendar year, but, as of the end of that calendar year no longer qualifies for the exemption because at that time it, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more, the issuer must begin complying with Sec. Sec.  235.3, 235.4, and 235.6 no later than July 1 of the succeeding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exemption for government-administered programs. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, Sec. Sec.  235.3, 235.4, and 235.6 do not apply to an interchange transaction fee received or charged by an issuer with respect to an electronic debit transaction if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The electronic debit transaction is made using a debit card that has been provided to a person pursuant to a Federal, State, or local government-administered payment program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cardholder may use the debit card only to transfer or debit funds, monetary value, or other assets that have been provided pursuant to such program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exemption for certain reloadable prepaid cards--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, Sec. Sec.  235.3, 235.4, and 235.6 do not apply to an interchange transaction fee received or charged by an issuer with respect to an electronic debit transaction using a general-use prepaid card that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not issued or approved for use to access or debit any account held by or for the benefit of the cardholder (other than a subaccount or other method of recording or tracking funds purchased or loaded on the card on a prepaid basis);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The only means of access to the underlying funds, except when all remaining funds are provided to the cardholder in a single transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Temporary cards. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``reloadable'' includes a temporary non-reloadable card issued solely in connection with a reloadable general-use prepaid card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exception. The exemptions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to any interchange transaction fee received or charged by an issuer on or after July 21, 2012, with respect to an electronic debit transaction if any of the following fees may be charged to a cardholder with respect to the card:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A fee or charge for an overdraft, including a shortage of funds or a transaction processed for an amount exceeding the account balance, unless the fee or charge is imposed for transferring funds from another asset account to cover a shortfall in the account accessed by the card; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A fee imposed by the issuer for the first withdrawal per calendar month from an ATM that is part of the issuer's designated ATM network.</p>
