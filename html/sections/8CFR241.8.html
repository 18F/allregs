                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. An alien who illegally reenters the United States  after having been removed, or having departed voluntarily, while under  an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal shall be removed from the  United States by reinstating the prior order. The alien has no right to  a hearing before an immigration judge in such circumstances. In  establishing whether an alien is subject to this section, the  immigration officer shall determine the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the alien has been subject to a prior order of removal.  The immigration officer must obtain the prior order of exclusion,  deportation, or removal relating to the alien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The identity of the alien, i.e., whether the alien is in fact an  alien who was previously removed, or who departed voluntarily while  under an   order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. In disputed cases,  verification of identity shall be accomplished by a comparison of  fingerprints between those of the previously excluded, deported, or  removed alien contained in Service records and those of the subject  alien. In the absence of fingerprints in a disputed case the alien shall  not be removed pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the alien unlawfully reentered the United States. In  making this determination, the officer shall consider all relevant  evidence, including statements made by the alien and any evidence in the  alien's possession. The immigration officer shall attempt to verify an  alien's claim, if any, that he or she was lawfully admitted, which shall  include a check of Service data systems available to the officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. If an officer determines that an alien is subject to  removal under this section, he or she shall provide the alien with  written notice of his or her determination. The officer shall advise the  alien that he or she may make a written or oral statement contesting the  determination. If the alien wishes to make such a statement, the officer  shall allow the alien to do so and shall consider whether the alien's  statement warrants reconsideration of the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Order. If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are  met, the alien shall be removed under the previous order of exclusion,  deportation, or removal in accordance with section 241(a)(5) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exception for applicants for benefits under section 902 of HRIFA  or sections 202 or 203 of NACARA. If an alien who is otherwise subject  to this section has applied for adjustment of status under either  section 902 of Division A of Public Law 105-277, the Haitian Refugee  Immigrant Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA), or section 202 of Public Law  105-100, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act  (NACARA), the provisions of section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act shall not apply. The immigration officer may not  reinstate the prior order in accordance with this section unless and  until a final decision to deny the application for adjustment has been  made. If the application for adjustment of status is granted, the prior  order shall be rendered moot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exception for withholding of removal. If an alien whose prior  order of removal has been reinstated under this section expresses a fear  of returning to the country designated in that order, the alien shall be  immediately referred to an asylum officer for an interview to determine  whether the alien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture  pursuant to Sec. 208.31 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Execution of reinstated order. Execution of the reinstated order  of removal and detention of the alien shall be administered in  accordance with this part.
