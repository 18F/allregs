This is the only other option for a state to meet its Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The items under Sec. 60.2515(a)(1), (2) and (7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions, and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)/(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A state with an already approved CISWI Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of EPA's previous state plan approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A state's Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under Title V of the Clean Air Act.
