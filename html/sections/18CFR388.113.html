                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section governs access to critical energy infrastructure information (CEII). The rules governing submission of CEII are contained in 18 CFR 388.112(b). The Commission reserves the right to restrict access to previously filed documents as well as Commission-generated documents containing CEII.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The procedures in this section are available at the requester's option as an alternative to the FOIA procedures in Sec. 388.108 where the information requested is exempted from disclosure under the FOIA and contains CEII.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Critical energy infrastructure information means specific engineering, vulnerability, or detailed design information about proposed or existing critical infrastructure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Relates details about the production, generation, transportation, transmission, or distribution of energy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Could be useful to a person in planning an attack on critical infrastructure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does not simply give the general location of the critical infrastructure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Critical infrastructure means existing and proposed systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, the incapacity or destruction of which would negatively affect security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accessing critical energy infrastructure information. (1) An Owner/operator

of a facility, including employees and officers of the owner/operator, may obtain CEII relating to its own facility directly from Commission staff without going through the procedures outlined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Non-employee agents of an owner/operator of such facility may obtain CEII relating to the owner/operator's facility in the same manner as owner/operators as long as they present written authorization from the owner/operator to obtain such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An Owner/operator

of a facility, including employees and officers of the owner/operator, may obtain CEII relating to its own facility directly from Commission staff without going through the procedures outlined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Non-employee agents of an owner/operator of such facility may obtain CEII relating to the owner/operator's facility in the same manner as owner/operators as long as they present written authorization from the owner/operator to obtain such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee of a federal agency acting within the scope of his or her federal employment may obtain CEII directly from Commission staff without following the procedures outlined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Any Commission employee at or above the level of division director or its equivalent may rule on federal agency representatives' requests for access to CEII.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A landowner whose property is crossed by or in the vicinity of a project may receive detailed alignment sheets containing CEII directly from Commission staff without submitting a non-disclosure agreement as outlined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. A landowner must provide Commission staff with proof of his or her property interest in the vicinity of a project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If any other requester has a particular need for information designated as CEII, the requester may request the information using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> File a signed, written request with the Commission's CEII Coordinator. The request must contain the following: Requester's name (including any other name(s) which the requester has used and the dates the requester used such name(s)), title, address, and telephone number; the name, address, and telephone number of the person or entity on whose behalf the information is requested; a detailed statement explaining the particular need for and intended use of the information; and a statement as to the requester's willingness to adhere to limitations on the use and disclosure of the information requested. A requester shall provide his or her date and place of birth upon request, if it is determined by the CEII Coordinator that this information is necessary to process the request. Unless otherwise provided in Section 113(d)(3), a requester must also file an executed non-disclosure agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A requester who seeks the information on behalf of all employees of an organization should clearly state that the information is sought for the organization, that the requester is authorized to seek the information on behalf of the organization, and that all the requesters agree to be bound by a non-disclosure agreement that must be executed by and will be applied to all individuals who have access to the CEII.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After the request is received, the CEII Coordinator will determine if the information is CEII, and, if it is, whether to release the CEII to the requester. The CEII Coordinator will balance the requester's need for the information against the sensitivity of the information. If the requester is determined to be eligible to receive the information requested, the CEII Coordinator will determine what conditions, if any, to place on release of the information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the CEII Coordinator determines that the CEII requester has not demonstrated a valid or legitimate need for the CEII or that access to the CEII should be denied for other reasons, this determination may be appealed to the General Counsel pursuant to Sec. 388.110 of this Chapter. The General Counsel will decide whether the information is properly classified as CEII, which by definition is exempt from release under FOIA, and whether the Commission should in its discretion make such CEII available to the CEII requester in view of the requester's asserted legitimacy and need.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Once a CEII requester has been verified by Commission staff as a legitimate requester who does not pose a security risk, his or her verification will be valid for the remainder of that calendar year. Such a requester is not required to provide detailed information about him or herself with subsequent requests during the calendar year. He or she is also not required to file a non-disclosure agreement with subsequent requests during the calendar year because the original non-disclosure agreement will apply to all subsequent releases of CEII.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If an organization is granted access to CEII as provided by paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, and later seeks to add additional individuals to the non-disclosure agreement, the names of these individuals must be sent to the CEII Coordinator with certification that notice has been given to the submitter. Any newly added individuals must execute a supplement to the original non-disclosure agreement indicating their acceptance of its terms. If there is no written opposition within five (5) days of notifying the CEII Coordinator and the submitter concerning the addition of any newly-named individuals, the CEII Coordinator will issue a standard notice accepting the addition of names to the non-disclosure agreement. If the submitter files a timely opposition with the CEII Coordinator, the CEII Coordinator will issue a formal determination addressing the merits of such opposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees for processing CEII requests will be determined in accordance with 18 CFR 388.109.
