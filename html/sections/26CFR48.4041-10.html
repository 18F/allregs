                                Sec. 48.4041-10  Exemption for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)</em> and (d)(3),  and Sec. 48.4221-4. In the case of a liquid sold for use as fuel in an  aircraft, a tax-free sale may be made only if the requirements of Sec.  48.4041-11 are met. For credit or refund of tax paid on fuels which have  been sold or used as supplies for vessels or aircraft, see section  6416(b)(2)(B), section 6427, and paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evidence required to establish exemption. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In order to  establish exemption from tax in the case of a sale of fuels for use as  supplies for vessels or aircraft, it is necessary that the seller obtain  from the owner, charterer, or authorized agent of the vessel or aircraft  and retain in its possession a property executed exemption certificate  in the form prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. If fuel is sold  tax free for use as supplies for civil aircraft employed in foreign  trade or in trade between the United States and any of its possessions,  the exemption certificate must show the name of the country in which the  aircraft is registered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If only occasional sales of fuels are made to a purchaser for  use which is exempt from tax as provided in this section, a separate  exemption certificate must be furnished for each order. However, if  sales are regularly or frequently made to a purchaser for such exempt  use, a certificate covering all orders for a specified period not to  exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable. Such certificates and proper  records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be  kept for inspection by the district director as provided in section  6001. If a seller's records with respect to any sale claimed to be tax  free do not include a proper certificate, with supporting invoices and  such other evidence as may be necessary to establish the exempt  character of the sale, tax is payable by the seller on the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acceptable form of exemption certificate. The following form of  exemption certificate, which must be adhered to in substance, is  acceptable for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Exemption Certificate</p><p class="depth0">(For use by purchasers of fuels for use as supplies for certain  vessels or aircraft (section 4041(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of  1954).)  (Date), 19--____________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned purchaser hereby certifies that he/she is the ________________________________________________________________________ (owner, charterer, or authorized agent of owner or charterer) of______________________________________________________________________ (Name of company and vessel)  and that the fuel specified in the accompanying order, or as specified  below or on the reverse side hereof, will be used only as fuel supplies  for a vessel belonging to one of the following classes of vessels  (including aircraft) to which section 4041(g) of the Internal Revenue  Code applies: (Check class to which vessel belongs):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels (including aircraft) engaged in foreign trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vessels engaged in trade between the Atlantic and Pacific ports  of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Vessels (including aircraft) engaged in trade between the United  States and any of its possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Vessels employed in the fisheries or whaling business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessels (including aircraft) of war of the United States or a  foreign nation.</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned understands that if the fuels are sold or used  otherwise than as stated above and for a taxable purpose specified in  section 4041 of the Internal Revenue Code, the undersigned will be  liable for the tax upon such sale or use. It is also understood that  this certificate may not be used in purchasing fuels, if such fuels are  for use as   fuels in pleasure vessels, or of any type of aircraft except--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Civil aircraft employed in foreign trade or trade between the  United States and any of its possessions, and otherwise entitled to  exemption, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aircraft owned by the United States or any foreign country and  constituting a part of the armed forces thereof.</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned understands that the fraudulent use of this  certificate to secure exemption will subject the undersigned and all  others making fraudulent use to a penalty equivalent to the amount of  tax due on the sale of the fuel and, upon conviction, to a fine of not  more than $10,000, or to imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or  both, together with the costs of prosecution. The purchaser also  understands that it must be prepared to establish by satisfactory  evidence the purpose for which the fuel purchased under this certificate  was used.  (Signature)_____________________________________________________________  (Address)_______________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  Registration Number if fuel used as supplies for civil aircraft engaged  in foreign trade or in trade between the United States and any of its  possessions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemption certificate not obtained prior to filing of seller's  excise tax return. If the exemption certificate is not obtained prior to  the time the seller files a return covering taxes due for the period  during which the sale was made, the seller must include the tax on the  sale in its return for that period. However, if the certificate is later  obtained, a claim for refund of the tax paid on the sale may be filed on  Form 843, or a credit for the tax paid may be taken upon a subsequent  return as provided by section 6416(b)(2)(B) and Sec. 48.6416(b)-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Liability of purchaser. The person who purchases fuels tax free  as provided in this section is liable for the tax imposed by section  4041 if the person sells or uses such fuel in a sale or use that is not  exempt under any provision of law applicable to the taxes imposed by  section 4041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Credit or refund. (1) If diesel fuel or special motor fuel upon  which the tax imposed by section 4041(a) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (2), has been paid, is  sold or used as supplies for vessels, a credit or refund of the tax is  available under section 6416(b)(2)(B) to the retail dealer who paid the  tax. As an alternative, a credit or refund of tax is available under  section 6427 to the operator of the vessel who used the fuel. Where the  retail dealer claims refund of the tax, the dealer, in accordance with  section 6416(a), must reimburse the operator of the vessel for the  amount of tax or obtain the written consent of the operator to the  filing of such claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If aviation fuel upon which the tax imposed by section 4041(c)  has been paid is sold or used as supplies for aircraft, credit or refund  of the tax is available only as a payment under section 6427 to the  operator of the aircraft who uses the fuel or to the person who resells  the fuel for such use.
