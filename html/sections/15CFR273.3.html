L. 100-418,  section 5164) amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 to, among other  things, require that each Federal agency, by a date certain and to the  extent economically feasible by the end of the fiscal year 1992, use the  metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other  business-related activities, except to the extent that such use is  impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of  markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are  producting competing products in non-metric units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology will assist in coordinating the efforts of Federal agencies  in meeting their obligations under the Metric Conversion Act, as  amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal agencies shall coordinate and plan for the use of the  metric system in their procurements, grants and other business-related  activities consistent with the requirements of the Metric Conversion  Act, as amended.

When taking  initiatives, they shall give due consideration to known effects of their  actions on State and local governments and the private sector, paying  particular attention to effects on small business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each Federal agency shall be responsible for developing plans,  establishing necessary organizational structure, and allocating  appropriate resources to carry out this policy.
