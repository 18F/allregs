                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A national committee that has received payments  from the Fund under 11 CFR part 9008 shall pay the United States  Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable  under this section. In making repayment determinations under this  section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and  examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.11 or otherwise obtained  by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this  subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will notify the committee of any repayment  determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not  later than 3 years after the last day of the Presidential nominating  convention. The Commission's issuance of an audit report to the  committee will constitute notification for purposes of the three year  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once the committee receives notice of the Commission's final  repayment determination under this section, the committee should give  preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of  the committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bases for repayment. The Commission may determine that the  national committee of a political party that has received payments from  the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the  circumstances described below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess payments. If the Commission determines that any portion  of the payments to the national committee or convention committee under  11 CFR 9008.6(b) was in excess of the aggregate payments to which the  national committee was entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5, it shall  so notify the national committee, and the national committee shall pay  to the Secretary an amount equal to such portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excessive expenditures. If the Commission determines that the  national committee or convention committee incurred convention expenses  in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR 9008.8(a), it shall notify the  national committee of the amount of such excessive expenditures, and the  national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the  amount specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Excessive contributions. If the Commission determines that the  national committee accepted contributions to defray convention expenses  which, when added to the amount of payments received, exceeds the  expenditure limitation of such party, it shall notify the national  committee of the amount of the contributions so accepted, and the  national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the  amount specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Improper usage or documentation. If the Commission determines  that any amount of any payment to the national committee or convention  committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was used for any purposes other than  the purposes authorized at 11 CFR 9008.7 or was not documented in  accordance with 11 CFR 9008.10, it shall notify the national committee  of the amount improperly   used or documented and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary  an amount equal to the amount specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unspent funds. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any portion of the payment under 11 CFR  9008.4 remains unspent after all convention expenses have been paid,  that portion shall be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The national committee or convention committee shall make an  interim repayment of unspent funds based on the financial position of  the committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of  the convention, allowing for a reasonable amount as determined by the  Commission to be withheld for unanticipated contingencies. The interim  repayment shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the end of  the ninth month following the last day of the convention. If, after  written request by the national committee or convention committee, the  Commission determines, upon review of evidence presented by either  committee, that amounts previously refunded are needed to defray  convention expenses, the Commission shall certify such amount for  payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All unspent funds shall be repaid to the U.S. Treasury no  later than 24 months after the last day of the convention, unless the  national committee has been granted an extension of time. The Commission  may grant any extension of time it deems appropriate upon request of the  national committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Income on investments of payments from the Fund. If the  Commission determines that the national committee or the convention  committee received any income as a result of investment or other use of  payments from the Fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(5), it shall so  notify the committee and the committee shall pay to the United States  Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any  Federal, State or local taxes on such income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Commission may seek repayment, or may initiate an  enforcement action, if the convention committee knowingly helps, assists  or participates in the making of a convention expenditure by the host  committee, government agency or municipal fund that is not in accordance  with 11 CFR 9008.52 or 9008.53, or the acceptance of a contribution by  the host committee or government agency or municipal fund from an  impermissible source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> through  (h).  [59 FR 33616, June 29, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 31880, June 16, 1995;  68 FR 47417, Aug. 8, 2003]</p>
