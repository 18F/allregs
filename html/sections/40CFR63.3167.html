Sec. 63.3164 and 63.3166, you must establish the operating  limits required by Sec. 63.3093 according to this section, unless you  have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits  under Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in Sec. 63.3093.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>  through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the  combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the  three test runs.

If problems are found during the  annual internal inspection of the catalyst, you must replace the  catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the  manufacturer's recommendations.

You must  keep the set point for the desorption gas inlet temperature no lower  than 6 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that  set point during the performance test for that concentrator and the  average desorption gas inlet temperature maintained during the  performance test for that concentrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> and (2) of this section.
