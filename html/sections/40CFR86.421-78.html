Written notice of a commitment to operate and test additional vehicles shall be given to the Administrator prior to the start of testing and not later than 30 days following notification of the test fleet selection. The results of tests performed by the manufacturer will be combined to determine deterioration factors. Each vehicle must meet applicable standards when tested by the Administrator and when those results are projected to the useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of testing a test vehicle and submitting data therefore, a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, submit exhaust emission data on a similar vehicle for which certification has previously been obtained or for which all applicable data has previously been submitted.</p>
