Museums include, but  are not limited to, the following types of institutions, if they  otherwise satisfy the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aquariums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arboretums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Botanical gardens;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Art museums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Children's museums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> General museums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Historic houses and sites;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> History museums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Nature centers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Natural history and anthropology museums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Planetariums;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Science and technology centers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Specialized museums; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Zoological parks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section, an institution uses a  professional staff if it employs at least one staff member, or the  fulltime equivalent, whether paid or unpaid primarily engaged in the  acquisition, care, or exhibition to the public of objects owned or used  by the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an  institution exhibits objects to the general public for the purposes of  this section if such exhibition is a primary purpose of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An institution that does not have as a primary purpose the  exhibition of objects to the general public but which can demonstrate  that it exhibits objects to the general public on a regular basis as a  significant, separate, distinct, and continuing portion of its  activities, and that it otherwise meets the requirements of this  section, may be determined to be a museum under this section.
