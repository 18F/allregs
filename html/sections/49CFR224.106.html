                                Sec. 224.106  Location of retroreflective sheeting.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Railroad freight cars. The retroreflective sheeting shall be  applied along the length of each railroad freight car side in the manner  provided by a uniform industry standard accepted by the Associate  Administrator that provides for distribution of material along the  length of each car and as close as practicable to 42 inches above the  top of rail. In the event such a standard is not proffered by industry  or accepted by the Associate Administrator, the criteria set forth in  this subpart shall apply. Retroreflective sheeting applied under this  part must be located clear of appurtenances and devices such as ladders  and other safety appliances, pipes, or other attachments that may  obscure its visibility. Retroreflective sheeting need not be applied to  discontinuous surfaces such as bolts, rivets, door hinges, or other  irregularly shaped areas that may prevent the sheeting from adhering to  the car sides. In addition, retroreflective sheeting need not be applied  over existing or required car stencils and markings. If necessary to  avoid appurtenances, discontinuous surfaces, or existing or required car  markings or stencils, 4x18 and 4x36 inch strips of retroreflective  material may be divided into 4x9 inch strips and applied on either side  of the appurtenance, discontinuous surface, or car markings or stencils,  as practicable. Unless otherwise specified, retroreflective sheeting  shall be applied along the sides of freight rolling stock at intervals  not to exceed every 12 feet, as practicable. If it is not practicable to  apply retroreflective sheeting every 12 feet   because of existing stencils, appurtenances, or discontinuous surfaces,  the sheeting shall be applied at the next smallest interval practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. On railroad freight cars other than flat cars and  tank cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be applied in either a  vertical or horizontal pattern along the length of the car sides, with  the bottom edge of the sheeting as close as practicable to 42 inches  above the top of rail. Retroreflective sheeting shall not be applied  below the side sill.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vertical application. If retroreflective sheeting is applied in  a vertical pattern, at least one 4x36 inch strip or two 4x18 inch  strips, one above the other, shall be applied as close to each end of  the car as practicable. Between these two vertical end strips, a minimum  of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at least every 12 feet, as  practicable. See Figures 1, 2 and 3.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.000     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.001     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.002</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Horizontal application. If retroreflective sheeting is applied  in a horizontal pattern, at least one 4x36 inch strip, or two 4x18 inch  strips, one above or next to the other, shall be applied as close to  each end of the car as practicable. Between these end strips, a minimum  of one 4x18 inch strip shall be   applied at least every 12 feet, as practicable. See Figures 4, 5, and 6. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.003     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.004     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.005</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tank cars. On tank cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be  applied vertically to each car side and centered on the horizontal  centerline of the tank, or as near as practicable. If it is not  practicable to safely apply the sheeting centered vertically about the  horizontal centerline of the tank,   the sheeting may be applied vertically with its top edge no lower than  the horizontal centerline of the tank. A minimum of either one 4x36 inch  strip or two 4x18 inch strips, one above the other, shall be applied as  close to each end of the car as practicable. Between these two end  strips, a minimum of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at least every  12 feet, as practicable. Retroreflective sheeting applied under this  part shall not be located in the spillage area directly beneath the  manway used to load and unload the tank. See Figures 7 and 8.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.006     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.007</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flat cars. On flat cars, retroreflective sheeting shall be  applied in a horizontal pattern along the length of the side sill with  the bottom edge of the sheeting no lower than the bottom of the side  sill and the top edge of the sheeting no higher than the top of the car  deck or floor. At least two   4x18 inch strips, one above the other, shall be applied as close to each  end of the car as practicable. If the side sill is less than 8 inches  wide, one 4x36 inch strip, or two 4x18 inch strips may be applied one  next to the other, dividing the strips into nine inch segments as  necessary in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Between the  two end strips, a minimum of one 4x18 inch strip shall be applied at  least every 12 feet, as practicable. See Figure 9. If a car has a  separate rack structure, retroreflective sheeting may be applied to the  flat car portion only in accordance with the requirements of this  section. For cars without continuous side sills, retroreflective  sheeting may be applied to other surfaces inboard of the sides, such as  the center sill, provided that the sheeting is not obscured by other  components.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC05.008</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cars of special construction. This paragraph applies to any car  the design of which is not compatible with the patterns of application  otherwise provided in this section. Retroreflective sheeting shall  conform as closely as practicable to the requirements of paragraphs  (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this   section and shall have the minimum amount of sheeting described in  Sec. 224.105 distributed along the length of each car side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Locomotives. Locomotives subject to this part shall be equipped  with at least the minimum amounts of retroreflective sheeting required  by Sec. 224.105 either in strips four inches wide and 18 or 36 inches  long and spaced as uniformly as practicable along the length of the  locomotive sides, or in one continuous strip, at least four inches wide,  along the length of the locomotive. Retroreflective sheeting applied to  locomotive sides shall be applied as close as practicable to 42 inches  from the top of the rail.</p>
