USEPA reserves the right to deem  permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will  be made according to appropriate procedures, and will be based upon the  permit, permit approval procedures or permit requirements which do not  conform with the operating permit program requirements or the  requirements of USEPA's underlying regulations.
