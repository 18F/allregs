                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policies and procedures to ensure compliance and prevent  evasion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Swap dealers and major swap participants shall have written  policies and procedures reasonably designed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prevent a swap dealer or major swap participant from evading or  participating in or facilitating an evasion of any provision of the Act  or any regulation promulgated thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Swap dealers and major swap participants shall implement and  monitor compliance with such policies and procedures as part of their  supervision and risk management requirements specified in subpart J of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Know your counterparty. Each swap dealer shall implement  policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain a  record of the essential facts concerning each counterparty whose  identity is known to the swap dealer prior to the execution of the  transaction that are necessary for conducting business with such  counterparty. For purposes of this section, the essential facts  concerning a counterparty are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facts required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and  rules;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facts required to implement the swap dealer's credit and  operational risk management policies in connection with transactions  entered into with such counterparty; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information regarding the authority of any person acting for  such counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> True name and owner. Each swap dealer or major swap participant  shall obtain and retain a record which shall show the true name and  address of each counterparty whose identity is known to the swap dealer  or major swap participant prior to the execution of the transaction, the  principal occupation or business of such counterparty as well as the  name and address of any other person guaranteeing the performance of  such counterparty and any person exercising any control with respect to  the positions of such counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reasonable reliance on representations. A swap dealer or major  swap participant may rely on the written representations of a  counterparty to satisfy its due diligence requirements under this  subpart, unless it has information that would cause a reasonable person  to question the accuracy of the representation. If agreed to by the  counterparties, such representations may be contained in counterparty  relationship documentation and may satisfy the relevant requirements of  this subpart for subsequent swaps offered to or entered into with a  counterparty, provided however, that such counterparty undertakes to  timely update any material changes to the representations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Manner of disclosure. A swap dealer or major swap participant  may provide the information required by this subpart by any reliable  means agreed to in writing by the counterparty; provided however, for  transactions initiated on a designated contract market or swap execution  facility, written agreement by the counterparty regarding the reliable  means of disclosure is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosures in a standard format. If agreed to by a  counterparty, the disclosure of material information that is applicable  to multiple swaps between a swap dealer or major swap participant and a  counterparty may be made in counterparty relationship documentation or  other written agreement between the counterparties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Record retention. Swap dealers and major swap participants shall  create a record of their compliance with the requirements of this  subpart and shall retain records in accordance with subpart F of this  part and Sec. 1.31 of this chapter and make them available to  applicable prudential regulators upon request.
