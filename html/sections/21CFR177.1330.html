From 20 percent to 70 percent of the carboxylic acid groups may optionally be neutralized to form sodium or zinc salts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The finished food-contact article described in paragraph (a) of this section, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of Sec.  176.170(c) of this chapter, yields net acidified chloroform-soluble extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.5 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface when tested by the methods described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and if the finished food-contact article is itself the subject of a regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and Sec.  179.45 of this chapter, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed for it by that regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Note: In testing the finished food-contact article, use a separate test sample for each required extracting solvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The finished food-contact article described in paragraph (b) of this section, when extracted according to the methods listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and referenced in this paragraph (d), using the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food as determined from table I of paragraph (f) of this section, shall yield net acidified chloroform-soluble extractives as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For fatty food use.

If when exposed to n-heptane, a particular film splits along die lines, thus permitting exposure of both sides of the film to the extracting solvent,

the results for that film sample are invalid and the test must be repeated for that sample until no splitting by the solvent occurs. If the finished food-contact article is itself the subject of a regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and Sec.  179.45 of this chapter, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed for it by that regulation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ See footnote 2 to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Note: In testing the finished food-contact article, use a separate test sample for each required extracting solvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Analytical methods--(1) Selection of extractability conditions for ionomeric resins. First ascertain the type of food (table 1 of Sec.  176.170(c) of this chapter) that is being packed or used in contact with the finished food-contact article described in paragraph (a) of this section, and also ascertain the normal conditions of thermal treatment used in packaging or contacting the type of food involved. Using table 2 of Sec.  176.170 (c) of this chapter, select the food-simulating solvent or solvents and the time-temperature test conditions that correspond to the intended use of the finished food-contact article. Having selected the appropriate food-simulating solvent or solvents and time-temperature exaggeration over normal use, follow the applicable extraction procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selection of extractability conditions for ionomeric resins. Using table I of paragraph (f) of this section ascertain the type of food that is being packed or used in contact with the finished food-contact article described in paragraph (b) of this section, and also ascertain the food-simulating solvent or solvents that correspond to the intended use of the finished food-contact article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Abbreviated test. For intended use involving food contact at or below 120 [deg]F (49 [deg]C), the appropriate food-simulating solvent is to contact the food-contact film for the time and temperatures as follows:

The results from a series of extraction times demonstrate equilibrium when the net chloroform-soluble extractives are unchanging within experimental error appropriate to the method as described in paragraphs (d) (1)(i) and (2)(i) of this section. Should equilibrium not be demonstrated over the above time series, extraction times must be extended until three successive unchanging values for extractives are obtained. In the case where intended uses involve temporary food contact above 120 [deg]F, the food-simulating solvent is to be contacted with the food-contact article under conditions of time and temperature that duplicate the actual conditions in the intended use. Subsequently the extraction is to be continued for the time period and under the conditions specified in the above table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reagents--(i) Water.

The finished food-contact articles shall be tested either by the extraction cell described in the Journal of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, Vol. 47, No. 1, p. 177-179 (February 1964), also

described in ASTM method F34-76 (Reapproved 1980), ``Standard Test Method for Liquid Extraction of Flexible Barrier Materials,'' which are incorporated by reference, or by adapting the in-container methods described in Sec.  175.300(e) of this chapter.

Quadruplicate samples should be tested, using for each replicate sample the number of finished articles with a food-contact surface nearest to 100 square inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Determination of amount of extractives--(i) Total residues. At the end of the exposure period, remove the test container or test cell from the oven, if any, and combine the solvent for each replicate in a clean Pyrex (or equivalent) flask or beaker, being sure to rinse the test container or cell with a small quantity of clean solvent. Evaporate the food-simulating solvents to about 100 milliliters in the flask, and transfer to a clean, tared evaporating dish (platinum or Pyrex), washing the flask three times with small portions of solvent used in the extraction procedure, and evaporate to a few milliliters on a nonsparking, low-temperature hotplate. The last few milliliters should be evaporated in an oven maintained at a temperature of 221 [deg]F (105 [deg]C). Cool the evaporating dish in a desiccator for 30 minutes and weigh the residues to the nearest 0.1 milligram, e.

Add 3 milliliters of 37 percent ACS reagent grade hydrochloric acid and 3 milliliters of distilled water to the evaporating dish containing the dried and weighed residue, e, obtained in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. Mix well so every portion of the residue is wetted with the hydrochloric acid solution. Then add 50 milliliters of chloroform. Warm carefully, and filter through Whatman No. 41 filter paper (or equivalent) in a Pyrex (or equivalent) funnel, collecting the filtrate in a clean separatory funnel. Shake for 1 minute, then draw off the chloroform layer into a clean tared evaporating dish (platinum or Pyrex). Repeat the chloroform extraction, washing the dish, the filter paper, and the separatory funnel with this second portion of chloroform. Add this filtrate to the original filtrate and evaporate the total down to a few milliliters on a low-temperature hotplate. The last few milliliters should be evaporated in an oven maintained at 221 [deg]F. Cool the evaporating dish in a desiccator for 30 minutes and weigh to the nearest 0.1 milligram to get the acidified chloroform-soluble extractives residue, e'.
