                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of Secs. 1.959-1 and 1.959-2, the  source of the earnings and profits from which distributions are made by  a foreign corporation as between earnings and profits attributable to  increases in earnings invested in United States property, previously  taxed subpart F income, previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn  from investment in less developed countries, previously excluded subpart  F income withdrawn from investment in foreign base company shipping  operations, and other amounts shall be determined in accordance with  section 959(c) and paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of section 316(a). For purposes of this section,  section 316(a) shall be applied, in determining the   source of distributions from the earnings and profits of a foreign  corporation, by first applying section 316(a)(2) and then by applying  section 316(a)(1)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em> (or which would have been  so included but for section 959(a)(2) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.959- 1),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and paragraph (c) of  Sec. 1.959-1), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, of this paragraph applies for purposes of determining  priority of distribution, and such earnings and profits shall be  considered attributable to the taxable year in which the withdrawal  occurs.

The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> M, a controlled foreign corporation, is organized on  January 1, 1963, and is 100-percent owned by A, a United States  shareholder.

For 1964, U Corporation has  no subpart F income or investment of earnings in United States property  but U Corporation has $100 of earnings and profits which it distributes  to T Corporation.
