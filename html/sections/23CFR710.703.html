                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Best value means the proposal offering the most overall public  benefits as determined through an evaluation of the amount of the  concession payment and other appropriate considerations. Such other  appropriate considerations may include, but are not limited to,  qualifications and experience of the concessionaire, expected quality of  services to be provided, the history or track record of the  concessionaire in providing the services, timelines for the delivery of  services, performance standards, complexity of the services to be  rendered, and revenue sharing. Such appropriate considerations may also  include, but are not limited to, policy considerations that are  important, but not quantifiable, such as retaining the ability to amend  the concession agreement if conditions change, having a desired level of  oversight over the facility, ensuring a certain level of maintenance and  operations for the facility, considerations relative to the structure  and amount of the toll rates, economic development impacts and  considerations, or social and environmental benefits and impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Concession agreement means an agreement between a highway agency  and a concessionaire under which the concessionaire is given the right  to operate and collect revenues or fees for the use of a federally  funded highway in return for compensation to be paid to the highway  agency. A concession agreement may include, but not be limited to,  obligations concerning the development, design, construction,  maintenance, operation, level of service, and/or capital improvements to  a facility over the term of the agreement. Concession agreement shall  not include agreements between government entities, even when  compensation is paid, where the primary purpose of the transaction is  not commercial in nature but for the purpose of determining governmental  ownership, control, jurisdiction, or responsibilities with respect to  the operation of a federally funded highway. The highway agency's  determination as to whether an agreement between government entities  constitutes a concession agreement shall be controlling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Concessionaire means any private or public entity that enters  into a concession agreement with a highway agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fair market value means the price at which a highway agency and  concessionaire are ready and willing to enter into a concession  agreement for a federally funded highway on, or as if in, the open  market for a reasonable period of time and in an arm's length  transaction to any willing, knowledgeable, and able buyer. For purposes  of this subpart, a concession agreement based on best value shall be  deemed fair market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federally funded highway means any highway (including highways,  bridges, and tunnels) acquired with Federal assistance made available  from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account). A  highway shall be deemed to be acquired with Federal assistance if  Federal assistance participated in either the purchase of any real  property, or in any capital expenditures in any fixtures located on real  property, within the right-of-way, including the highway and any  structures located upon the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Highway agency means any State transportation department or  other public authority with jurisdiction over a federally funded  highway.</p>
