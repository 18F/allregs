                                Sec. 725.15  Determining applicability when microorganism identity
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consulting EPA. Persons intending to conduct activities  involving microorganisms may determine their obligations under this part  by consulting the Inventory or the microorganisms and uses specified in  Sec. 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. This section establishes  procedures for EPA to assist persons in determining whether the  microorganism or the use is listed on the Inventory, in Sec. 725.239 or  in subpart M of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential identity or use. In some cases it may not be  possible to directly determine if a specific microorganism is listed,  because portions of that entry may contain generic information to  protect confidential business information (CBI). If any portion of the  microorganism's identity or use has been claimed as CBI, that portion  does not appear on the public version of the Inventory, in Sec. 725.239  or in subpart M of this part. Instead, it is contained in a confidential  version held in EPA's Confidential Business Information Center (CBIC).  The public versions contain generic information which masks the  confidential business information. A person who intends to conduct an  activity involving a microorganism or use whose entry is described with  generic information will need to inquire of EPA whether the unreported  microorganism or use is on the confidential version.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uncertain microorganism identity. The current state of  scientific knowledge leads to some imprecision in describing a  microorganism. As the state of knowledge increases, EPA will be  developing policies to determine whether one microorganism is equivalent  to another. Persons intending to conduct activities involving  microorganisms may inquire of EPA whether the microorganisms they intend  to manufacture, import, or process are equivalent to specific  microorganisms described on the Inventory, in Sec. 725.239, or in  subpart M of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirement of bona fide intent. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EPA will answer the  inquiries described in paragraph (a) of this section only if the Agency  determines that the person has a bona fide intent to conduct the  activity for which reporting is required or for which any exemption may  apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To establish a bona fide intent to manufacture, import, or  process a microorganism, the person who intends to manufacture, import,  or process the microorganism must submit the following information in  writing to the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Document  Control Officer, 7407, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC  20460, ATTN: BIOTECH bona fide submission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Taxonomic designations and supplemental information required by  Sec. 725.12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A signed statement certifying that the submitter intends to  manufacture, import, or process the microorganism for commercial  purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of research and development activities conducted  with the microorganism to date, demonstration of the submitter's ability  to produce or obtain the microorganism from a foreign manufacturer, and  the purpose for which the person will manufacture, import, or process  the microorganism.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An indication of whether a related microorganism was previously  reviewed by EPA to the extent known by the submitter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A specific description of the major intended application or use  of the microorganism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an importer or processor cannot provide all the information  required by paragraph (b) of this section, because it is claimed as  confidential business information by its foreign manufacturer or  supplier, the foreign manufacturer or supplier may supply the  information directly to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EPA will review the information submitted by the manufacturer,  importer, or processor under this paragraph to determine whether that  person has shown a bona fide intent to manufacture, import, or process  the   microorganism. If necessary, EPA will compare this information to the  information requested for the confidential microorganism under Sec.  725.85(b)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In order for EPA to make a conclusive determination of the  microorganism's status, the proposed manufacturer, importer, or  processor must show a bona fide intent to manufacture, import, or  process the microorganism and must provide sufficient information to  establish identity unambiguously. After sufficient information has been  provided, EPA will inform the manufacturer, importer, or processor  whether the microorganism is subject to this part and if so, which  sections of this part apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the microorganism is found on the confidential version of the  Inventory, in Sec. 725.239 or in subpart M of this part, EPA will  notify the person(s) who originally reported the microorganism that  another person (whose identity will remain confidential, if so  requested) has demonstrated a bona fide intent to manufacture, import,  or process the microorganism and therefore was told that the  microorganism is on the Inventory, in Sec. 725.239, or in subpart M of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A disclosure to a person with a bona fide intent to manufacture,  import, or process a particular microorganism that the microorganism is  on the Inventory, in Sec. 725.239, or in subpart M of this part will  not be considered a public disclosure of confidential business  information under section 14 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> EPA will answer an inquiry on whether a particular microorganism  is subject to this part within 30 days after receipt of a complete  submission under paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
