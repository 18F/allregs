Packages shall be numbered with a package  identification number or serial number in accordance with Sec. 20.179  (b) or (c). Packages shall be labeled with the name, address, and permit  number of the manufacturer, the quantity (in gallons) of spirits  contained in the package, and   the applicable words ``Recovered denatured alcohol formula No. ----'' or  ``Recovered specially denatured rum formula No. ----.'' If the  restoration or redenaturation is performed by a user or dealer permittee  (not a distilled spirits plant), the permittee shall return the same  materials to the same manufacturer and shall not intermingle them with  materials received from other sources.</p>
