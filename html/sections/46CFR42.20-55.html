Sec. 42.15-15 to 42.15-30, inclusive, and the width of the trunk deck stringer provides a satisfactory gangway and sufficient lateral stiffness; however, small access openings with watertight covers may be permitted in the freeboard deck;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A permanent working platform fore and aft fitted with guard rails is provided by the trunk deck, or by detached trunks connected to superstructures by efficient permanent gangways;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ventilators are protected by the trunk by watertight covers or by other equivalent means;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Open rails are fitted on the weather parts of the freeboard deck in way of the trunk for at least half their length;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The machinery casings are protected by the trunk, by a superstructure of at least standard height, or by a deckhouse of the same height and of equivalent strength;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The breadth of the trunk is at least 60 percent of the breadth of the vessel; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where there is no superstructure, the length of the trunk is at least 0.6L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The full length of an efficient trunk reduced in the ratio of its mean breadth to B shall be its effective length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The standard height of a trunk is the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter deck.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the height of a trunk is less than the standard height, its effective length shall be reduced in the ratio of the actual to the standard height. Where the height of hatchway coamings on the trunk deck is less than that required under Sec. 42.15-25(a), a reduction from the actual height of trunk shall be made which corresponds to the difference between the actual and required height of coaming.
