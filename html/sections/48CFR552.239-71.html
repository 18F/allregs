This clause is applicable to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology resources or services in which the Contractor has physical or electronic access to GSA's information that directly supports the mission of GSA, as indicated by GSA. The term information technology, as used in this clause, means any equipment, including telecommunications equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This includes major applications as defined by OMB Circular A-130. Examples of tasks that require security provisions include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hosting of GSA e-Government sites or other IT operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition, transmission, or analysis of data owned by GSA with significant replacement cost should the Contractors copy be corrupted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Access to GSA major applications at a level beyond that granted the general public; e.g., bypassing a firewall; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any new information technology systems acquired for operations within the GSA must comply with the requirements of HSPD-12 and OMB M-11-11. Usage of the credentials must be implemented in accordance with OMB policy and NIST guidelines (e.g., NIST SP 800-116). The system must operate within the GSA's access management environment. Exceptions must be requested in writing and can only be granted by the GSA Senior Agency Information Security Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> IT Security Plan. The Contractor shall develop, provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract.

Access shall be provided to the extent required, in GSA's judgment, to conduct an inspection, evaluation, investigation or audit, including vulnerability testing to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of GSA data or to the function of information technology systems operated on behalf of GSA, and to preserve evidence of computer crime. This information shall be available to GSA upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Notification regarding employees. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer when an employee either begins or terminates employment when that employee has access to GSA information systems or data. If an employee's employment is terminated, for any reason, access to GSA's information systems or data shall be immediately disabled and the credentials used to access the information systems or data shall be immediately confiscated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Termination. Failure on the part of the Contractor to comply with the terms of this clause may result in termination of this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
