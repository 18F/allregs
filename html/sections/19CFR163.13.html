                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Customs may take, and applicants and participants may appeal and obtain administrative review of, the following decisions regarding the Recordkeeping Compliance Program provided for in Sec. 163.12:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Denial of certification for program participation in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Removal of certification for program participation in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Denial of certification for program participation--(1) Grounds for denial. Customs may deny an application for certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant fails to meet the requirements set forth in Sec. 163.12(b)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A circumstance involving the applicant arises that would justify initiation of a certification removal action under paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the judgment of Customs, the applicant appears not to be in compliance with Customs laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Denial procedure. If the Director of the Miami regulatory audit field office determines that an application submitted under Sec. 163.12 should not be approved and that certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program should not be granted, the Director shall issue a written notice of denial to the applicant. The notice of denial shall set forth the reasons for the denial and shall advise the applicant of its right to file an appeal of the denial in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certification removal--(1) Grounds for removal. The certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program by a certified recordkeeper may be removed when any of the following conditions are discovered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The certification privilege was obtained through fraud or mistake of fact;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The program participant no longer has a valid bond;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The program participant fails on a recurring basis to provide entry records when demanded by Customs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The program participant willfully refuses to produce a demanded or requested record;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The program participant is no longer in compliance with the Customs laws and regulations, including the requirements set forth in Sec. 163.12(b)(3); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The program participant is convicted of any felony or has committed acts which would constitute a misdemeanor or felony involving theft, smuggling, or any theft-connected crime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Removal procedure. If Customs determines that the certification of a program participant should be removed, the Director of the Miami regulatory audit field office shall serve the program participant with written notice of the removal. Such notice shall

inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and shall advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of removal. The removal of certification shall be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification shall be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures thereunder have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Appeal of certification denial or removal--(1) Appeal of certification denial. A person may challenge a denial of an application for certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program by filing a written appeal with the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The appeal must be received by the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, within 30 calendar days after issuance of the notice of denial. The Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, will review the appeal and will respond with a written decision within 30 calendar days after receipt of the appeal unless circumstances require a delay in issuance of the decision. If the decision cannot be issued within the 30-day period, the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, will advise the appellant of the reasons for the delay and of any further actions which will be carried out to complete the appeal review and of the anticipated date for issuance of the appeal decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appeal of certification removal. A certified recordkeeper who has received a CBP notice of removal of certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program may challenge the removal by filing a written appeal with the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229. The appeal must be received by the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, within 30 calendar days after issuance of the notice of removal. The Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, shall consider the allegations upon which the removal was based and the responses made thereto by the appellant and shall render a written decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days after receipt of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix to Part 163--Interim (a)(1)(A) List</p><p class="depth0">List of Records Required for the Entry of Merchandise</p><p class="depth0">General Information</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 508 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1508), sets forth the general recordkeeping requirements for Customs-related activities. Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1509) sets forth the procedures for the production and examination of those records (which includes, but is not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 509(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by title VI of Public Law 103-182, commonly referred to as the Customs Modernization Act (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)), requires the production, within a reasonable time after demand by the Customs Service is made (taking into consideration the number, type and age of the item demanded) if ``such record is required by law or regulation for the entry of the merchandise (whether or not the Customs Service required its presentation at the time of entry).'' Section 509(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 103-182 (19 U.S.C. 1509(e)) requires the Customs Service to identify and publish a list of the records and entry information that is required to be maintained and produced under subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 509 (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)). This list is commonly referred to as ``the (a)(1)(A) list.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Customs Service has tried to identify all the presently required entry information or records on the following list. However, as automated programs and new procedures are introduced, these may change. In addition, errors and omissions to the list may be discovered upon further review by Customs officials or the trade. Pursuant to section 509(g), the failure to produce listed records or information upon reasonable demand may result in penalty action or liquidation or reliquidation at a higher rate than entered. A recordkeeping penalty may

not be assessed if the listed information or records are transmitted to and retained by Customs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other recordkeeping requirements: The importing community and Customs officials are reminded that the (a)(1)(A) list only pertains to records or information required for the entry of merchandise. An owner, importer, consignee, importer of record, entry filer, or other party who imports merchandise, files a drawback claim or transports or stores bonded merchandise, any agent of the foregoing, or any person whose activities require them to file a declaration or entry, is also required to make, keep and render for examination and inspection records (including, but not limited to, statements, declarations, documents and electronically generated or machine readable data) which pertain to any such activity or the information contained in the records required by the Tariff Act in connection with any such activity, and are normally kept in the ordinary course of business. While these records are not subject to administrative penalties, they are subject to examination and/or summons by Customs officers. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of significant judicially imposed penalties and denial of import privileges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The following list does not replace entry requirements, but is merely provided for information and reference. In the case of the list conflicting with regulatory or statutory requirements, the latter will govern.</p><p class="depth0">List of Records and Information Required for the Entry of Merchandise</p><p class="depth0">The following records (which include, but are not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data) are required by law or regulation for the entry of merchandise and are required to be maintained and produced to Customs upon reasonable demand (whether or not Customs required their presentation at the time of entry). Information may be submitted to Customs at the time of entry in a Customs authorized electronic or paper format. Not every entry of merchandise requires all of the following information. Only those records or information applicable to the entry requirements for the merchandise in question will be required/mandatory. The list may be amended as Customs reviews its requirements and continues to implement the Customs Modernization Act. When a record or information is filed with and retained by Customs, the record is not subject to recordkeeping penalties, although the underlying backup or supporting information from which it is obtained may also be subject to the general record retention regulations and examination or summons pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509. (All references, unless otherwise indicated, are to the current edition of title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, as amended by subsequent Federal Register documents.)
