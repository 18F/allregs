                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Eligible persons or governmental agencies may be  designated to perform official services (excluding appeal inspection)  within a specified area (other than export port locations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If official inspection services are  performed in an area by a designated agency, Class X and Class Y  weighing services in that area may be performed only by the designated  agency if the agency applies for designation to provide weighing  services and is found qualified by the Service. If the agency designated  to provide official inspection services is found not qualified or does  not apply, the Class X and Class Y weighing services may be performed by  another available agency that is found qualified and is designated by  the Service, or the official services may be performed by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim authority. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By agency. A designated agency may  perform official services outside its assigned area on an interim basis  when authorized by the Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By Service. Official inspection services and/or Class X and  Class Y weighing services may be performed by the Service in an area  (other than export port locations) on an interim basis in accordance  with sections 7(h) and 7A(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Who can apply. Any State or local governmental agency or any  person may apply, subject to sections 7 and 7A of the Act, to the  Service for designation as an official agency to perform official  inspection services (excluding appeal inspection) and/or Class X and  Class Y weighing services in a given area (other than export port  locations) in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When and how to apply. An application for designation should be  filed with the Service, according to the provisions of the Federal  Register notice which requests applicants for designation to perform  official services in existing or new geographic areas. The application  for designation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall be submitted on a form furnished by the Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall be typewritten or legibly written in English;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shall show or be accompanied by documents which show all  information requested on the form, or otherwise required by the Service;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Shall be signed by the applicant or its chief operating officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review of conditions and criteria for designation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Application. Each application for a designation shall be reviewed to  determine whether it complies with paragraph (d) of this section. If an  application is not in compliance, the applicant shall be provided an  opportunity to submit the needed information. If the needed information  is not submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by the Service,  the application may be dismissed. When an application is dismissed, the  Service shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the reason(s) for the  dismissal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicant. Each applicant for authority to operate as as  designated agency shall be reviewed to determine whether the applicant  meets the conditions and criteria contained in sections 7(f)(1)(A) and  (B) of the Act, Sec. 800.199 of the regulations, and paragraph (g) of  this section. The requested designation may be granted if the Service  determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requested action is consistent with the need for official  services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant meets the conditions and criteria specified in  the Act and regulations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant is better able than any other applicant to  provide official services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Area of responsibility--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Each agency shall be  assigned an area of responsibility by the Service. Each area shall be  identified by geographical boundaries and, in the case of a State or  local government, shall not exceed the jurisdictional boundaries of the  State or the local government, unless otherwise approved by the Service.  The area of responsibility may not include any export elevators at  export port locations or any portion of an area of responsibility  assigned to another agency that is performing the same functions, except  as otherwise provided in Sec. 800.117. A designated agency may perform  official services at locations outside its assigned area of  responsibility only after obtaining approval from the Service, or in  accordance with provisions set forth in Sec. 800.117.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amending. A request for an amendment to an assigned area of  responsibility shall (i) be submitted to the Service in writing; (ii)  specify the change desired; (iii) be signed by the applicant or its  chief operating officer; and (iv) be accompanied by the fee prescribed  by the Service. The assigned area may be amended if the Service  determines that the amendment is consistent with the provisions and  objectives of the Act, regulations, and instructions. Upon a finding of  need, the Service may initiate action to change an assigned area of  responsibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specified service points. An agency may change its specified  service points by notifying the Service in advance. Interested persons  may obtain a list of specified service points within an agency's area of  responsibility by contacting the agency. The list shall include all  specified service points and shall identify each specified service point  which operates on an intermittent or seasonal basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Responsibilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Providing official services. Insofar as  practicable, each agency shall be responsible for providing at all  locations in its assigned area each service authorized by the  designation. An agency may, subject to Service approval, make  arrangements with a neighboring agency to provide official services  requested infrequently. The agency shall perform all official services  according to the Act, regulations, and instructions in effect at the  time of designation or which may be promulgated subsequently.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fees. The agency shall charge fees according to Sec. 800.70.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Staffing, licensing, and training--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. The agency shall  employ sufficient personnel to provide the official services normally  requested in an accurate and timely manner. Each agency shall only use  personnel licensed by the Service for the performance of official  services and shall train and assist its personnel in acquiring and  maintaining the necessary skills. Each agency shall keep the Service  informed of the employment status of each of its licensees and any  substantial change in a licensee's duties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies. State agencies shall employ official personnel  on the basis of job qualifications rather than political affiliations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rotation of personnel. Where feasible, each agency shall rotate  licensees among elevators and other facilities as is necessary to  preserve the integrity of the official inspection and weighing systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Supervision. The agency and its officials shall be responsible  for the actions of the official personnel employed by the agency, for  direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for  the conduct of official services and related activities at the agency.  The agency shall supervise official activities, in accordance with the  Act, regulations, and instructions, and shall take action necessary to  ensure that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and  are not involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or  instructions. Each agency shall report to the responsible field office  information which shows or may show a violation of any provision of the  Act, regulations, or instructions and information on any instructions  which have been issued to agency personnel by Service personnel or by  any other person which are inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Conflict of interest--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. Each agency and any officer,  director, stockholder, employee, or other related entity shall not have  a conflict of interest, as defined in Section 11 of the Act and Sec.  800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be waived  pursuant to Sec. 800.199(d). The agency shall advise the Service  immediately of any proposed change in name, ownership, officers or  directors, or control of the agency and, if a trust, any change  affecting the trust agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unofficial activities. Except as provided in Sec. 800.76(a),  the agency or personnel employed by the agency shall not perform any  unofficial service that is the same as the official services covered by  the designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Facilities and equipment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. The laboratory and office  facilities of each agency shall be: Located; equipped; and large enough  so that requested services are provided in an orderly and timely manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equipment testing. Each agency shall test the equipment it uses  for official services according to the instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Security. Each agency shall provide sufficient security to  ensure that official samples, records, equipment, and forms are  reasonably secure from theft, alteration, or misuse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Certificate control system. Each agency shall establish a  certificate control system for all official certificates it receives,  issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide  for (i) recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or  received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or  unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate  issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would  permit retrieval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Records. Each agency shall maintain the records specified in  Sec. Sec. 800.145 through 800.159.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Termination and renewal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Triennial--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Termination. A  designation shall terminate at a time specified by the Administrator,  but not later than 3 years after the effective date of the designation.  A notice of triennial termination shall be issued by the Service to a  designated agency at least 120 calendar days in advance of the  termination date. The notice shall provide instructions for requesting  renewal of the designation. Failure to receive a notice from the Service  shall not exempt a designated agency from the responsibility of having  its designation renewed on or before the specified termination date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Renewal. Designations may be renewed, upon application, in  accordance with criteria and procedures for designation prescribed in  section 7(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. The  Administrator may decline to renew a designation if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The requesting agency fails to meet or comply with any of the  criteria for designation set forth in the Act, regulations, and  instructions, of</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Administrator determines that another qualified applicant is  better able to provide official services in the assigned area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user fees prescribed  by the Service for supervisory costs related to official inspection and  weighing services within 30 days after due shall result in the automatic  termination of the designation. The designation shall be reinstated if  fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by  the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days after  the termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Voluntary cancellation. An agency may request that its  designation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Suspension or revocation of designation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. A  designation is subject to suspension or revocation, under section  7(g)(3) of the Act, by the Service, whenever the Administrator  determines that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The agency has failed to meet one or more of the criteria  specified in section 7(f) of the Act or the regulations for the  performance of official functions, or otherwise has not complied with  any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Has been convicted of any violation of other Federal law  involving the handling or official inspection of grain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Summary suspension. The Service may, without first affording  the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the  ``respondent'') an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or  refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has  expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the  Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the  designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the  official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to  reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the  respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar  days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service  shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph  (h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it  finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational  arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the  respondent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other than summary suspension. Except as provided in paragraph   (h)(4)(ii) of the section, before the Service revokes or suspends a  designation, the respondent shall be: (A) Notified by the Service of the  proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afforded an  opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Practice  Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary  Under Various Statutes (7 CFR part 1, subpart H). Before initiating  formal adjudicatory proceedings, the Service may, at its discretion,  afford the respondent an opportunity to present its views on the  proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference.  If, as a result of the informal conference, a consent agreement is  reached, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Provision of services following suspension or termination. If  the designation of an agency is suspended, terminated, or the renewal of  a designation is not granted, the Service shall attempt, upon a finding  of need, to arrange for a replacement agency. If a qualified replacement  agency cannot be designated on a timely basis, a qualified agency, if  available, shall be designated on an interim basis. If a qualified  agency is not available on an interim basis, the Service shall provide  needed services on an interim basis.
