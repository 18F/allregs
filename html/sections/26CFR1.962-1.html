                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An individual United States shareholder may, in  accordance with Sec. 1.962-2, elect to have the provisions of section  962 apply for his taxable year. In such case--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section).  Thus, an individual United States shareholder may elect to be subject to  tax at corporate rates on amounts included in his gross income under  section 951(a) and to have the benefit of a credit for certain foreign  taxes paid with respect to the earnings and profits attributable to such  amounts. Section 962 also provides rules for the treatment of an actual  distribution of earnings and profits previously taxed in accordance with  an election of the benefits of this section. See Sec. 1.962-3. For  transitional rules for certain taxable years, see Sec. 1.962-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules of application. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section in  the case of an electing United States shareholder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination of taxable income. The term ``taxable income'' as  used in section 11 shall mean the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> for such taxable year; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All amounts which would be required to be included in his gross  income under section 78 for such taxable year with respect to the  amounts referred to in (a) of this subdivision if such shareholder were  a domestic corporation.  For purposes of this section, such sum shall not be reduced by any  deduction of the United States shareholder even if such shareholder's  deductions exceed his gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on surtax exemption. The surtax exemption provided  by section 11(c) shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio  to $25,000 ($50,000 in the case of a taxable year ending after December  31, 1974, and before January 1, 1976) as the amounts included in his  gross income under section 951(a) for the taxable year bear to his pro  rata share of the earnings and profits for the taxable year of all  controlled foreign corporations with respect to which such United States  shareholder includes any amount in his gross income under section 951(a)  for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allowance of foreign tax credit--(i) In general. Subject to the  applicable limitation of section 904 and to the provisions of this  subparagraph, there shall be allowed as a credit against the United  States tax on the amounts described in subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  paragraph the foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes  deemed paid under section 960(a)(1) by the electing United States  shareholder with respect to such amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of section 960(a)(1). In applying section 960(a)(1)  for purposes of this subparagraph in the case of an electing United  States shareholder, the term ``domestic corporation'' as used in  sections 960(a)(1) and 78, and the term ``corporation'' as used in  section 901, shall be treated as referring to such shareholder with  respect to the amounts described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Carryback and carryover of excess tax deemed paid. For  purposes of this subparagraph, any amount by which the foreign income,  war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid by the electing United  States shareholder for any taxable year under section 960(a)(1) exceed  the limitation determined under subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph  shall be treated as a carryback and carryover of excess tax paid under  section 904(d), except that in no case shall excess tax paid be   deemed paid in a taxable year if an election under section 962 by such  shareholder does not apply for such taxable year. Such carrybacks and  carryovers shall be applied only against the United States tax on  amounts described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation on credit. For purposes of determining the  limitation under section 904 on the amount of the credit for foreign  income, war profits, and excess profits taxes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deemed paid with respect to amounts described in subparagraph  (1)(i) of this paragraph, the electing United States shareholder's  taxable income shall be considered to consist only of the amounts  described in such subparagraph (1)(i), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Paid with respect to amounts other than amounts described in  subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the electing United States  shareholder's taxable income shall be considered to consist only of  amounts other than the amounts described in such subparagraph (1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effect of choosing benefits of sections 901 to 905. The  provisions of this subparagraph shall apply for a taxable year whether  or not the electing United States shareholder chooses the benefits of  subpart A of part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 (sections 901 to 905)  of the Internal Revenue Code for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustration. The application of this section may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Throughout his taxable year ending December 31, 1964, A, an  unmarried individual who is not the head of a household, owns 60 of the  100 shares of the one class of stock in foreign corporation M and 80 of  the 100 shares of the one class of stock in foreign corporation N. A and  corporations M and N use the calendar year as a taxable year,  corporations M and N are controlled foreign corporations throughout the  period here involved, and neither corporation is a less developed  country corporation. The earnings and profits and subpart F income of,  and the foreign income taxes paid by, such corporations for 1964 are as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">M           N ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Pretax earnings and profits.....................    $500,000  $1,200,000 Foreign income taxes............................     200,000     400,000 Earnings and profits............................     300,000     800,000 Subpart F income................................     150,000     750,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Apart from his section 951(a) income, A has gross income of $200,600 and  $100,000 of deductions attributable to such income. He is required to  include $90,000 (0.60x$150,000) in gross income under section 951(a)  with respect to M Corporation and $600,000 (0.80x$750,000) with respect  to N Corporation. A elects to have the provisions of section 962 apply  for 1964 and computes his tax as follows:  Tax on amounts included under section 951(a):</p><p class="depth0">Income under section 951(a) from M Corporation................         $90,000</p><p class="depth0">Gross-up under sections 960(a)(1) and 78 ($90,000/                      60,000</p><p class="depth0">$300,000x$200,000)...........................................</p><p class="depth0">Income under section 951(a) from N Corporation................         600,000</p><p class="depth0">Gross-up under sections 960(a)(1) and 78 ($600,000/                    300,000</p><p class="depth0">$800,000x$400,000)...........................................</p><p class="depth0">----------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income under section 11...............................       1,050,000</p><p class="depth0">Normal tax (0.22x$1,050,000)..................................................        $231,000</p><p class="depth0">Surtax exemption ([$90,000+$600,000]/                                   21,036</p><p class="depth0">[0.60x$300,000+(0.80x$800,000)]x$25,000).....................</p><p class="depth0">Subject to surtax under section 11 ($1,050,000-$21,036).......       1,028,964</p><p class="depth0">Surtax (0.28x$1,028,964)......................................................         288,110</p><p class="depth0">----------------</p><p class="depth0">Tentative U.S. tax............................................................         519,110</p><p class="depth0">Foreign tax credit ($60,000+$300,000).........................         360,000</p><p class="depth0">----------------</p><p class="depth0">Total U.S. tax payable on amounts included under section 951(a).............................        $159,110 Tax with respect to other income:</p><p class="depth0">Gross income..................................................................         200,600</p><p class="depth0">Less:</p><p class="depth0">Personal exemption..........................................             600</p><p class="depth0">Deductions..................................................         100,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0">100,600</p><p class="depth0">----------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income................................................................         100,000</p><p class="depth0">Tax with respect to such other taxable income.................  ..............          59,340</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0">Total tax ($159,110+$59,340)................................................................         218,450 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     [T.D. 6858, 30 FR 13695, Oct. 28, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7413, 41 FR  12640, Mar. 26, 1976]</p>
