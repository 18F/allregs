                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Household responsibility to report. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monthly reporting  households are required to report as provided in Sec. 273.21. Quarterly  reporting households are subject to the procedures as provided in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Simplified reporting households are  subject to the procedures as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this  section. Certified change reporting households are required to report  the following changes in circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A change of more than $50 in the amount of unearned income,  except changes relating to public assistance (PA) or general assistance  (GA) in project areas in which GA and food stamp cases are jointly  processed. The State agency is responsible for identifying changes  during the certification period in the amount of PA, or GA in jointly  processed cases. If GA and food stamp cases are not jointly processed,  the household is responsible for reporting changes in GA of more than  $50.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A change in the source of income, including starting or stopping  a job or   changing jobs, if the change in employment is accompanied by a change in  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> One of the following, as determined by the State agency  (different options may be used for different categories of households as  long as no household is required to report under more than one option;  the State may also utilize different options in different project areas  within the State):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A change in the wage rate or salary or a change in full-time or  part-time employment status (as determined by the employer or as defined  in the State's PA program), provided that the household is certified for  no more than 6 months; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A change in the amount earned of more than $100 a month from the  amount last used to calculate the household's allotment, provided that  the household is certified for no more than 6 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All changes in household composition, such as the addition or  loss of a household member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes in residence and the resulting change in shelter  costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The acquisition of a licensed vehicle not fully excludable  under Sec. 273.8(e); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When cash on hand, stocks, bonds, and money in a bank account or  savings institution reach or exceed a total of $2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Changes in the legal obligation to pay child support. However,  the State agency may remove this reporting requirement if it has chosen  to use information provided by the State's CSE agency in determining a  household's legal obligation to pay child support, the amount of its  obligation, and amounts the household has actually paid in accordance  with Sec. 273.2(f)(1)(xii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For able-bodied adults subject to the time limit of  Sec. 273.24, any changes in work hours that bring an individual below 20  hours per week, averaged monthly, as defined in Sec. 273.24(a)(1)(i). An  individual shall report this information in accordance with the  reporting system for income to which he is subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certified households must report changes within 10 days of the  date the change becomes known to the household. For reportable changes  of income, the State agency may require that change to be reported as  early as within 10 days of the date that the household becomes aware of  the change or as late as within 10 days of the date that the household  receives the first payment attributable to the change. For example, in  the case of new employment, the State may require the household to  report the change within 10 days of the date that the household becomes  aware of the new employment, within 10 days of the date the employment  begins or within 10 days of the date that the household receives its  first paycheck. For households subject to semi-annual reporting, the  household must report changes no later than 10 days from the end of the  calendar month in which the change occurred, provided that the household  has at least 10 days within which to report the change. Optional  procedures for reporting changes are contained in paragraph (f) of this  section for households in States with forms for jointly reporting food  stamp and public assistance changes and food stamp and general  assistance changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An applying household shall report all changes related to its  food stamp eligibility and benefits at the certification interview.  Changes, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which occur  after the interview but before the date of the notice of eligibility,  shall be reported by the household within 10 days of the date of the  notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The State agency may establish a system of quarterly reporting  in lieu of the change reporting requirements specified under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. The following requirements are applicable to  quarterly reporting systems:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Included households. The State agency may include all households  within a quarterly reporting system, except migrant or seasonal  farmworker households, households that have no earned income and in  which all adult members are elderly or disabled, households in which all  members are homeless individuals, or households subject to the reporting  requirement under paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section.   The State agency may also limit quarterly reporting to specific  categories of households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notification of the quarterly reporting requirement. The State  agency must notify households of the quarterly reporting requirement,  including the consequences of failure to file a report, at initial  certification and recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to file a complete form by the specified filing date.  If a household fails to file a complete report by the specified filing  date, the State agency will send a notice to the household advising it  of the missing or incomplete report no later than 10 days from the date  the report should have been submitted. If the household does not respond  to the notice, the household's participation shall be terminated. The  State agency may combine the notice of a missing or incomplete report  with the adequate notice of termination described in paragraph (a)(4)(v)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Content of the quarterly report form. The State agency may  include all of the items subject to reporting under paragraph (a)(1) of  this section in the quarterly report, except changes reportable under  paragraphs (a)(1)(vii) or (a)(1)(viii) of this section, or may limit the  report to specific items while requiring that households report other  items through the use of the change report form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reduction or termination of benefits. If the household files a  complete report resulting in reduction or termination of benefits, the  State agency shall send an adequate notice, as defined in Sec. 271.2 of  this chapter. The notice must be issued so that it will be received by  the household no later than the time that its benefits are normally  received. If the household fails to provide sufficient information or  verification regarding a deductible expense, the State agency will not  terminate the household, but will instead determine the household's  benefits without regard to the deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Changes reported outside of the quarterly report. The State  agency must act on any changes reported outside of the quarterly report  in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Sole reporting requirement. The quarterly report form shall be  the sole reporting requirement for any information that is required to  be reported on the form, except that able-bodied adults subject to the  time limit of Sec. 273.24 shall report whenever their work hours fall  below 20 hours per week, averaged monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The State agency may establish a simplified reporting system in  lieu of the change reporting requirements specified under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. The following requirements are applicable to  simplified reporting systems:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Included households. The State agency may include any household  certified for at least 4 months within a simplified reporting system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notification of simplified reporting requirement. At the  initial certification, recertification and when the State agency  transfers the households to simplified reporting, the State agency shall  provide the household with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A written and oral explanation of how simplified reporting  works;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A written and oral explanation of the reporting requirements  including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What needs to be reported and verified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the report is due;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> How to obtain assistance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The consequences of failing to file a report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special assistance in completing and filing periodic reports to  households whose adult members are all either mentally or physically  handicapped or are non-English speaking or otherwise lacking in reading  and writing skills such that they cannot complete and file the required  report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A telephone number (toll-free number or a number where collect  calls will be accepted outside the local calling area) which the  household may call to ask questions or to obtain help in completing the  periodic report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Periodic report. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency may require a household  to submit a periodic report on its circumstances from once every 4  months up to once every 6 months. The State agency need not require a  household certified for 6 months or less to submit   a periodic report during its certification period. However, except for  households in which all adults are elderly or disabled with no earned  income, a household certified for more than 6 months must submit a  periodic report at least once every 6 months. Households in which all  adults are elderly or disabled with no earned income must not be  required to submit periodic reports more frequently than once a year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The periodic report form must request from the household  information on any changes in circumstances in accordance with  paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vii) of this section and conform to  the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the household files a complete report resulting in reduction  or termination of benefits, the State agency shall send an adequate  notice, as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter. The notice must be  issued so that the household will receive it no later than the time that  its benefits are normally received. If the household fails to provide  sufficient information or verification regarding a deductible expense,  the State agency will not terminate the household, but will instead  determine the household's benefits without regard to the deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If a household fails to file a complete report by the specified  filing date, the State agency will send a notice to the household  advising it of the missing or incomplete report no later than 10 days  from the date the report should have been submitted. If the household  does not respond to the notice, the household's participation shall be  terminated. The State agency may combine the notice of a missing or  incomplete report with the adequate notice of termination described in  paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The periodic report form shall be the sole reporting requirement  for any information that is required to be reported on the form, except  that a household required to report less frequently than quarterly shall  report when its monthly gross income exceeds the monthly gross income  limit for its household size in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(v) of  this section, and able-bodied adults subject to the time limit of  Sec. 273.24 shall report whenever their work hours fall below 20 hours  per week, averaged monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Processing periodic reports. In selecting a due date for the  periodic report, the State agency must provide itself sufficient time to  process reports so that households will receive adequate notice of  action on the report in the first month of the new reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reporting when gross income exceeds 130 percent of poverty. A  household subject to simplified reporting in accordance with paragraph  (a)(5)(i) of this section, whether or not it is required to submit a  periodic report, must report when its monthly gross income exceeds the  monthly gross income limit for its household size, as defined at  Sec. 273.9(a)(1). The household shall use the monthly gross income limit  for the household size that existed at the time of its most recent  certification or recertification, regardless of any subsequent changes  in its household size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> State agency action on changes reported outside of a periodic  report. The State agency must act when the household reports that its  gross monthly income exceeds the gross monthly income limit for its  household size. For other changes, the State agency need not act if the  household reports a change for another public assistance program in  which it is participating and the change does not trigger action in that  other program but results in a decrease in the household's food stamp  benefit. The State agency must act on all other changes reported by a  household outside of a periodic report in accordance with one of the  following two methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency must act on any change in household  circumstances in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The State agency must act on any change in accordance with  paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it would increase the household's  benefits. The State agency must not act on changes that would result in  a decrease in the household's benefits unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The household has voluntarily requested that its case be closed  in accordance with Sec. 273.13(b)(12);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency has information about the household's  circumstances considered verified upon receipt; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There has been a change in the household's PA grant, or GA grant  in project areas where GA and food stamp cases are jointly processed in  accord with Sec. 273.2(j)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> State plan requirement. A State agency that chooses to use  simplified reporting procedures in accordance with this section must  state in its State plan of operation that it has implemented simplified  reporting and specify the types of households to whom the reporting  requirement applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> must specify in their State plan of operation that they  have selected this option. If the State agency chooses not to utilize  information provided by its State CSE agency, the State agency may make  reporting child support payments an optional change reporting item in  accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.The State agency shall  process the reports in accordance with procedures for the systems used  in budgeting the household's income and deductions. The following  requirements apply to quarterly reports:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall provide the household a reasonable period  after the end of the last month covered by the report in which to return  the report. If the household does not file the report by the due date or  files an incomplete report, the State agency shall provide the household  with a reminder notice advising the household that it has 10 days from  the date the State agency mails the notice to file a complete report. If  the household does not file a complete report by the extended filing  date as specified in the reminder notice, the State agency shall  determine the household's eligibility and benefits without consideration  of the child support deduction. The State agency shall not terminate the  benefits of a household for failure to submit a quarterly report unless  the household is otherwise ineligible. The State agency shall send the  household an adequate notice as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter if  the household fails to submit a complete report or if the information  contained on a complete report results in a reduction or termination of  benefits. The quarterly report shall meet the requirements specified in  paragraph (b) of this section. The State agency may combine the content  of the reminder notice and the adequate notice as long as the notice  meets the requirements of the individual notices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The quarterly report form, if required, shall be the sole  reporting requirement for reporting child support payments during the  certification period. Households excluded from monthly reporting as  specified in Sec. 273.21(b) and households required to submit monthly  reports shall not be required to submit quarterly reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> State agencies shall not impose any food stamp reporting  requirements on households except as provided in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Report forms. (1) The State agency shall provide the household  with a form for reporting the changes required in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of  this section to be reported within 10 days and shall pay the postage for  return of the form. The change report form shall, at a minimum, include  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A space for the household to report whether the change shall  continue beyond the report month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Act in  understandable terms and in prominent and boldface lettering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reminder to the household of its right to claim actual  utility costs if its costs exceed the standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The number of the food stamp office and a toll-free number or a  number where collect calls will be accepted for households outside the  local calling area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement describing the changes in household circumstances  contained in Sec. 273.12(a)(1) that must be reported and a statement  which clearly informs the household that it is required to report these  changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the State agency has chosen to disregard reported changes  that affect some deductions in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section, a statement explaining that the State agency will not change  certain deductions until the household's next recertification and  identifying those deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The quarterly report form, including the form for the quarterly  reporting of the child support obligation, and the periodic report form  used in simplified reporting under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section,  must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be written in clear, simple language;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meet the bilingual requirements described in Sec. 272.4(b) of  this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the date by which the agency must receive the form;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the consequences of submitting a late or incomplete  form including whether the State agency shall delay payment if the form  is not received by a specified date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Specify the verification the household must submit with the  form;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Inform the household where to call for help in completing the  form;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Include a statement to be signed by a member of the household  indicating his or her understanding that the information provided may  result in a reduction or termination of benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Include a brief description of the Food Stamp Program fraud  penalties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Include a statement explaining that the State agency will not  change certain deductions until the household's next recertification and  identify those deductions if the State agency has chosen to disregard  reported changes that affect certain deductions in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If the form requests Social Security numbers, include a  statement of the State agency's authority to require Social Security  numbers (including the statutory citation, the title of the statute, and  the fact that providing Social Security numbers is mandatory), the  purpose of requiring Social Security numbers, the routine uses for  Social Security numbers, and the effect of not providing Social Security  numbers. This statement may be on the form itself or included as an  attachment to the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes reported over the telephone or in person by the  household shall be acted on in the same manner as those reported on the  change report form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A change report form shall be provided to newly certified  households at the time of certification, at recertification if the  household needs a new form; and a new form shall be sent to the  household whenever a change report form is returned by the household. A  change report may be provided to households more often at the State  agency's option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Increase in benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For changes which result in an  increase in a household's benefits, other than changes described in  paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the State agency shall make the  change effective no later than the first allotment issued 10 days after  the date the change was reported to the State agency. For example, a $30  decrease in income reported on the 15th of May would increase the  household's June allotment. If the same decrease were reported on May  28, and the household's normal issuance cycle was on June 1, the  household's allotment would have to be increased by July.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For changes which result in an increase in a household's  benefits due to the addition of a new household member who is not a  member of another certified household, or due to a decrease of $50 or  more in the household's gross monthly income, the State agency shall  make the change effective not later than the first allotment issued 10  days after the date the change was reported. However, in no event shall  these changes take effect any later than the month following the month  in which the change is reported. Therefore, if the change is reported  after the 20th of a month and it is too late for the State agency to  adjust the following month's allotment, the State agency shall issue a  supplementary ATP or otherwise provide an opportunity for the household  to obtain the increase in benefits by the 10th day of the following  month, or the household's normal issuance cycle in that month, whichever  is later. For example, a household reporting a $100 decrease in income  at any time during May would have its June allotment increased. If the  household reported the change after the 20th of May and it was too late  for the State agency to adjust the ATP normally issued on June 1, the  State agency would issue a supplementary ATP for the amount of the  increase by June 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency may elect to verify changes which result in  an increase in a household's benefits in accordance with the  verification requirements of Sec. 273.2(f)(8)(ii), prior to taking  action on these changes. If the State agency elects this option, it must  allow the household 10 days from the date the change is reported to  provide verification required by Sec. 273.2(f)(8)(ii). If the household  provides verification within this period, the State shall take action on  the changes within the timeframes specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and  (ii) of this section. The timeframes shall run from the date the change  was reported, not from the date of verification. If, however, the  household fails to provide the required verification within 10 days  after the change is reported but does provide the verification at a  later date, then the timeframes specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and  (ii) of this section for taking action on changes shall run from the  date verification is provided rather than from the date the change is  reported. If the State agency does not elect this option, verification  required by Sec. 273.2(f)(8)(ii) must be obtained prior to the issuance  of the second normal monthly allotment after the change is reported. If  in these circumstances the household does not provide verification, the  household's benefits will revert to the original benefit level. Whenever  a State agency increases a household's benefits to reflect   a reported change and subsequent verification shows that the household  was actually eligible for fewer benefits, the State agency shall  establish a claim for the overissuance in accordance with Sec. 273.18.  In cases where the State agency has determined that a household has  refused to cooperate as defined in Sec. 273.2(d), the State agency shall  terminate the household's eligibility following the notice of adverse  action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Decreases in benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the household's benefit level  decreases or the household becomes ineligible as a result of the change,  the State agency shall issue a notice of adverse action within 10 days  of the date the change was reported unless one of the exemptions to the  notice of adverse action in Sec. 273.13 (a)(3) or (b) applies. When a  notice of adverse action is used, the decrease in the benefit level  shall be made effective no later than the allotment for the month  following the month in which the notice of adverse action period has  expired, provided a fair hearing and continuation of benefits have not  been requested. When a notice of adverse action is not used due to one  of the exemptions in Sec. 273.13 (a)(3) or (b), the decrease shall be  made effective no later than the month following the change.  Verification which is required by Sec. 273.2(f) must be obtained prior  to recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency may suspend a household's certification  prospectively for one month if the household becomes temporarily  ineligible because of a periodic increase in recurring income or other  change not expected to continue in the subsequent month. If the  suspended household again becomes eligible, the State agency shall issue  benefits to the household on the household's normal issuance date. If  the suspended household does not become eligible after one month, the  State agency shall terminate the household's certification. Households  are responsible for reporting changes as required by paragraph (a) of  this section during the period of suspension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unclear information. During the certification period, the State  agency may obtain information about changes in a household's  circumstances from which the State agency cannot readily determine the  effect of the change on the household's benefit amount. The State agency  might receive such unclear information from a third party or from the  household itself. The State agency must pursue clarification and  verification of household circumstances using the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency must issue a written request for contact (RFC)  which clearly advises the household of the verification it must provide  or the actions it must take to clarify its circumstances, which affords  the household at least 10 days to respond and to clarify its  circumstances, either by telephone or by correspondence, as the State  agency directs, and which states the consequences if the household fails  to respond to the RFC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the household does not respond to the RFC, or does respond  but refuses to provide sufficient information to clarify its  circumstances, the State agency must issue a notice of adverse action as  described in Sec. 273.13 which terminates the case, explains the reasons  for the action, and advises the household of the need to submit a new  application if it wishes to continue participating in the program. When  the household responds to the RFC and provides sufficient information,  the State agency must act on the new circumstances in accordance with  paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the household does not respond to the RFC, or does respond  but refuses to provide sufficient information to clarify its  circumstances, the State agency may elect to issue a notice of adverse  action as described in Sec. 273.13 which suspends the household for 1  month before the termination becomes effective, explains the reasons for  the action, and advises the household of the need to submit a new  application if it wishes to continue participating in the program. If a  household responds satisfactorily to the RFC during the period of  suspension, the State agency must reinstate the household without  requiring a new application, issue the allotment for the month of  suspension, and if necessary, adjust the household's participation with  a new notice of adverse action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> State agency option for processing changes in deductible  expenses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the household reports a change to an established  deduction amount during the first six months of the certification  period, other than a change in earnings or residence, that would affect  the household's eligibility for, or amount of, the deduction under  Sec. 273.9(d), the State agency may at its option disregard the change  and continue to provide the household the deduction amount that was  established at certification until the household's next recertification  or after the sixth month for households certified for 12 months. When a  household reports a change in residence, the State agency must  investigate and take action on potential changes in shelter costs  arising from this reported change. However, if a household fails to  provide information regarding the associated changes in shelter costs  within 10 days of the report, the State agency should send a notice to  the household that their allotment will be recalculated without the  deduction. The notice will make it clear that the household does not  need to await its first regular utility or rental payments to contact  the food stamp office. Alternative forms of verification can be  accepted, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a household assigned a 24-month certification  period in accordance with Sec. 273.10(f)(1) and (f)(2), the State agency  must act on any disregarded changes reported during the first 12 months  of the certification period at the required 12-month contact for elderly  and disabled households and in the thirteenth month of the certification  period for households residing on a reservation who are required to  submit monthly reports. Changes reported during the second 12 months of  the certification period can be disregarded until the household's next  recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the State agency chooses to act on changes that affect a  deduction, it may not act on changes in only one direction, i.e.,  changes that only increase or decrease the amount of the deduction, but  must act on all changes that affect the deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency may disregard changes reported by the  household in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and  changes it learns of from a source other than the household. The State  agency must not disregard new deductions, changes in earned income or  changes in shelter costs arising from a reported change in residence  until the household's next recertification or after the sixth month of a  12-month certification period but must act on those reports in  accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. When a  household reports a change in residence, the State agency must  investigate and take action on potential changes in shelter costs  arising from this reported change. However, if a household fails to  provide information regarding the associated changes in shelter costs  within 10 days of the report, the State agency should send a notice to  the household that their allotment will be recalculated without the  deduction. The notice will make it clear that the household does not  need to await its first regular utility or rental payments to contact  the food stamp office. Alternative forms of verification can be  accepted, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A State agency that chooses to postpone action on reported  changes in deductions in accordance with this paragraph (c) must state  in its State plan of operation that it has selected this option and  specify the deductions affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure to report. If the State agency discovers that the  household failed to report a change as required by paragraph (a) of this  section and, as a result, received benefits to which it was not  entitled, the State agency shall file a claim against the household in  accordance with Sec. 273.18. If the discovery is made within the  certification period, the household is entitled to a notice of adverse  action if the household's benefits are reduced. A household shall not be  held liable for a claim because of a change in household circumstances  which it is not required to report in accordance with Sec. 273.12(a)(1).  Individuals shall not be disqualified for failing to report a change,  unless the individual is disqualified in accordance with the  disqualification procedures specified in Sec. 273.16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Mass changes. Certain changes are initiated by the State or  Federal government which may affect the entire caseload or significant  portions of the caseload. These changes include, but are not limited to,  adjustments to the income eligibility standards, the shelter and  dependent care deductions, the maximum food stamp allotment and the  standard deduction; annual and seasonal adjustments to State utility  standards; periodic cost-of-living adjustments to Retirement, Survivors,  and Disability Insurance (RSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and  other Federal benefits; periodic adjustments to Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families (TANF) or General Assistance (GA) payments; and other  changes in the eligibility and benefit criteria based on legislative or  regulatory changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal adjustments to eligibility standards, allotments, and  deductions, and State adjustments to utility standards. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State  agencies shall implement these changes for all households at a specific  point in time. Adjustments to Federal standards shall be implemented  prospectively regardless of the household's budgeting system. Annual and  seasonal adjustments in State utility standards shall also be  implemented prospectively for all households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Adjustments in the maximum food stamp allotment shall be  effective in accordance with Sec. 273.10(e)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjustments in the standard deduction shall be effective in  accordance with Sec. 273.9(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Adjustments in the shelter deduction shall be effective in  accordance with Sec. 273.9(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Adjustments in the income eligibility standards shall be  effective in accordance with Sec. 273.9(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A notice of adverse action shall not be used for these changes.  At a minimum, the State agencies shall publicize these mass changes  through the news media; posters in certification offices, issuance  locations, or other sites frequented by certified households; or general  notices mailed to households. At its option, the State agency may send  the notice described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section or some other  type of written explanation of the change. A household whose  certification period overlaps a seasonal variation in the State utility  standard shall be advised at the time of initial certification of when  the adjustment will occur and what the variation in the benefit level  will be, if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mass changes in public assistance and general assistance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  When the State agency makes an overall adjustment to public assistance  (PA) payments, corresponding adjustments in households' food stamp  benefits shall be handled as a mass change in accordance with the  procedures in paragraphs (e) (4), (5) and (6) of this section. When the  State agency has at least 30 days, advance knowledge of the amount of  the PA adjustment, the State agency shall make the change in benefits  effective in the same month as the PA change. If the State agency does  not have sufficient notice, the food stamp change shall be effective no  later than the month following the month in which the PA change was  made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies which also administer a general assistance (GA)  program shall handle mass adjustments to GA payments in accordance with  the schedules outlined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) and the procedures in  paragraphs (e) (4), (5) and (6) of this section. However, where State  agencies do not administer both programs, mass changes in GA payments  shall be subject to the schedule in paragraph (e)(3) and the procedures  in paragraphs (e) (4), (5) and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency may make mass changes by applying percentage  increases communicated by the source agency to represent cost-of-living  increases provided in other benefit programs. These changes shall be  reflected no later than the second allotment issued after the month in  which the change becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency may update household income information based  on cost-of-living increases supplied by a data source covered under the  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (CMA) in accordance  with Sec. 272.12 of this chapter. The State agency shall take action,  including proper notices to households, to terminate, deny or reduce  benefits based on this information if it is considered verified upon  receipt under Sec. 273.2(f)(9). If the information is not considered  verified upon receipt, the State agency shall initiate appropriate  action and notice in accordance with Sec. 273.2(f)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notice for mass change. When the State agency makes a mass  change in SNAP eligibility or benefits by simultaneously converting the  caseload, or that portion of the caseload that is affected, using the  percentage increase calculation provided for in Sec. 273.12(e)(3)(i), or  by conducting individual desk reviews using information not covered  under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act (CMA) in place of  a mass change, it shall notify all households whose benefits are reduced  or terminated in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph,  except for mass changes made under Sec. 273.12(e)(1); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At a minimum, the State agency shall inform the household of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The general nature of the change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples of the change's effect on households' allotments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The month in which the change will take effect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The household's right to a fair hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The household's right to continue benefits and under what  circumstances benefits will be continued pending a fair hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> General information on whom to contact for additional  information; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The liability the household will incur for any overissued  benefits if the fair hearing decision is adverse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At a minimum, the State agency shall notify the household of  the mass change or the result of the desk review on the date the  household is scheduled to receive the allotment which has been changed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In addition, the State shall notify the household of the mass  change as much before the household's scheduled issuance date as  reasonably possible, although the notice need not be given any earlier  than the time required for advance notice of adverse action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fair hearings. The household shall be entitled to request a fair  hearing when it is aggrieved by the mass change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Continuation of benefits. A household which requests a fair  hearing due to a mass change shall be entitled to continued benefits at  its previous level only if the household meets three criteria;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The household does not specifically waive its right to a  continuation of benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The household requests a fair hearing in accordance with  Sec. 273.13(a)(1); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The household's fair hearing is based upon improper  computation of food stamp eligibility or benefits, or upon  misapplication or misinterpretation of Federal law or regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> PA and GA households. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)  of this section, PA households have the same reporting requirements as  any other food stamp household. PA households which report a change in  circumstances to the PA worker shall be considered to have reported the  change for food stamp purposes. All of the requirements pertaining to  reporting   changes for PA households shall be applied to GA households in project  areas where GA and food stamp cases are processed jointly in accordance  with provisions of Sec. 273.2(j)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State agencies may use a joint change reporting form for  households to report changes for both PA and food stamp purposes.  Whenever a joint change reporting form is used, the State agency shall  insure that adjustments are made in a household's eligibility status or  allotment for the months determined appropriate given the household's  budgeting cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies may combine the use of a joint PA/food stamp  change reporting form with a PA reporting system that demands the  regular submission of reports, such as a monthly reporting system. The  State agency shall insure that the procedures in Sec. 273.21(h) are  followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency may not terminate a household's food stamp  benefits solely because it has terminated the household's PA benefits  without a separate determination that the household fails to satisfy the  eligibility requirements for participation in the Program. Whenever a  change results in the reduction or termination of a household's PA  benefits within its food stamp certification period, the State agency  must follow the procedures set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a change in household circumstances requires a reduction or  termination in the PA payment and the State agency has sufficient  information to determine how the change affects the household's food  stamp eligibility and benefit level, the State agency must take the  following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the change requires a reduction or termination of food stamp  benefits, the State agency must issue a single notice of adverse action  for both the PA and food stamp actions. If the household requests a fair  hearing within the period provided by the notice of adverse action, the  State agency must continue the household's food stamp benefits on the  basis authorized immediately prior to sending the notice. If the fair  hearing is requested for both programs' benefits, the State agency must  conduct the hearing according to PA procedures and timeliness standards.  However, the household must reapply for food stamp benefits if the food  stamp certification period expires before the fair hearing process is  completed. If the household does not appeal, the State agency must make  the change effective in accordance with the procedures specified in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the household's food stamp benefits will increase as a result  of the reduction or termination of PA benefits, the State agency must  issue the PA notice of adverse action, but must not take any action to  increase the household's food stamp benefits until the household decides  whether it will appeal the PA adverse action. If the household decides  to appeal and its PA benefits are continued, the household's food stamp  benefits must continue at the previous level. If the household does not  appeal, the State agency must make the change effective in accordance  with the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, except  that the time limits for the State agency to act on changes which  increase a household's benefits must be calculated from the date the PA  notice of adverse action period expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever a change results in the termination of a household's  PA benefits within its food stamp certification period, and the State  agency does not have sufficient information to determine how the change  affects the household's food stamp eligibility and benefit level (such  as when an absent parent returns to a household, and the household asks  to have its TANF case closed without providing any information on the  income of the new household member), the State agency must take the  following action:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the situation requires a reduction or termination of PA  benefits, the State agency must issue a request for contact (RFC) in  accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section at the same time it  sends a PA notice of adverse action. Before taking further action, the  State agency must wait until the household's PA notice of adverse action  period expires or until the household requests a fair hearing, whichever  occurs first. If the household requests a fair hearing and elects to  have its PA benefits continued pending   the appeal, the State agency must continue the household's food stamp  benefits at the same level. If the household decides not to request a  fair hearing and continuation of its PA benefits, the State agency must  resume action on the changes as required in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the situation does not require a PA notice of adverse action,  the State agency must issue a RFC and take action in accordance with  paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Depending on the household's response to the RFC, the State  agency must take appropriate action, if necessary, to close the  household's case or adjust the household's benefit amount.
