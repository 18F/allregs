                                Sec. 416.933  How we make a finding of presumptive disability
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">We may make a finding of presumptive disability or presumptive  blindness if the evidence available at the time we make the presumptive  disability or presumptive blindness finding reflects a high degree of  probability that you are disabled or blind. In the case of readily  observable impairments (e.g., total blindness), we will find that you  are disabled or blind for purposes of this section without medical or  other evidence. For other impairments, a finding of disability or  blindness must be based on medical evidence or other information that,  though not sufficient for a formal determination of disability or  blindness, is sufficient for us to find that there is a high degree of  probability that you are disabled or blind. For example, for claims  involving the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the Social Security  Field Office may make a finding of presumptive disability if your  medical source provides us with information that confirms that your  disease manifestations meet the severity of listing-level criteria for  HIV. Of course, regardless of the specific HIV manifestations, the State  agency may make a finding of presumptive disability if the medical  evidence or other information reflects a high degree of probability that  you are disabled.
