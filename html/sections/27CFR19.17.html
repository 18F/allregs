                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A TTB officer may detain any container containing, or supposed to contain, spirits when the appropriate TTB officer believes that the required tax on those spirits has not been paid or determined or that the removal of the container is in violation of law or the provisions of this part. The appropriate TTB officer will hold the container at a safe place until it is determined whether the detained property is subject to forfeiture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation. A detention under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed 72 hours without process of law or intervention of the appropriate TTB officer. However, the detained container may be kept on the premises beyond the 72-hour period without process of law or intervention if the person possessing the container immediately before its detention executes a waiver

of this 72-hour limitation on detention of the container.
