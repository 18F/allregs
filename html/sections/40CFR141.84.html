                                Sec.  141.84  Lead service line replacement requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Systems that fail to meet the lead action level in tap samples  taken pursuant to Sec.  141.86(d)(2), after installing corrosion control  and/or source water treatment (whichever sampling occurs later), shall  replace lead service lines in accordance with the requirements of this  section. If a system is in violation of Sec.  141.81 or Sec.  141.83 for  failure to install source water or corrosion control treatment, the  State may require the system to commence lead service line replacement  under this section after the date by which the system was required to  conduct monitoring under Sec.  141.86(d)(2) has passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A water system shall replace annually at least 7 percent of  the initial number of lead service lines in its distribution system. The  initial number of lead service lines is the number of lead lines in  place at the time the replacement program begins. The system shall  identify the initial number of lead service lines in its distribution  system, including an identification of the portion(s) owned by the  system, based on a materials evaluation, including the evaluation  required under Sec.  141.86(a) and relevant legal authorities (e.g.,  contracts, local ordinances) regarding the portion owned by the system.  The first year of lead service line replacement shall begin on the first  day following the end of the monitoring period in which the action level  was exceeded under paragraph (a) of this section. If monitoring is  required annually or less frequently, the end of the monitoring period  is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs. If  the State has established an alternate monitoring period, then the end  of the monitoring period will be the last day of that period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any water system resuming a lead service line replacement  program after the cessation of its lead service line replacement program  as allowed by paragraph (f) of this section shall update its inventory  of lead service lines to include those sites that were previously  determined not to require replacement through the sampling provision  under paragraph (c) of this section. The system will then divide the  updated number of remaining lead service lines by the number of  remaining years in the program to determine the number of lines that  must be replaced per year (7 percent lead service line replacement is  based on a 15-year replacement program, so, for example, systems  resuming lead service line replacement after previously conducting two  years of replacement would divide the updated inventory by 13). For  those systems that have completed a 15-year lead service line  replacement program, the State will determine a schedule for replacing  or retesting lines that were previously tested out under the replacement  program when the system re-exceeds the action level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A system is not required to replace an individual lead service  line if the lead concentration in all service line samples from that  line, taken pursuant to Sec.  141.86(b)(3), is less than or equal to  0.015 mg/L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A water system shall replace that portion of the lead service  line that it owns. In cases where the system does not own the entire  lead service line, the system shall notify the owner of the line, or the  owner's authorized agent, that the system will replace the portion of  the service line that it owns and shall offer to replace the owner's  portion of the line. A system is not required to bear the cost of  replacing the privately-owned portion of the line, nor is it required to  replace the privately-owned portion where the owner chooses not to pay  the cost of replacing the privately-owned portion of the line, or where  replacing the privately-owned portion would be precluded by State, local  or common law. A water system that does not replace the entire length of  the service line also shall complete the following tasks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 45 days prior to commencing with the partial  replacement of a lead service line, the water system shall provide  notice to the resident(s) of all buildings served by the line explaining  that they may experience a temporary increase of lead levels in   their drinking water, along with guidance on measures consumers can take  to minimize their exposure to lead. The State may allow the water system  to provide notice under the previous sentence less than 45 days prior to  commencing partial lead service line replacement where such replacement  is in conjunction with emergency repairs. In addition, the water system  shall inform the resident(s) served by the line that the system will, at  the system's expense, collect a sample from each partially-replaced lead  service line that is representative of the water in the service line for  analysis of lead content, as prescribed under Sec.  141.86(b)(3), within  72 hours after the completion of the partial replacement of the service  line. The system shall collect the sample and report the results of the  analysis to the owner and the resident(s) served by the line within  three business days of receiving the results. Mailed notices post-marked  within three business days of receiving the results shall be considered  ``on time.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The water system shall provide the information required by  paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the residents of individual  dwellings by mail or by other methods approved by the State. In  instances where multi-family dwellings are served by the line, the water  system shall have the option to post the information at a conspicuous  location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State shall require a system to replace lead service lines  on a shorter schedule than that required by this section, taking into  account the number of lead service lines in the system, where such a  shorter replacement schedule is feasible. The State shall make this  determination in writing and notify the system of its finding within 6  months after the system is triggered into lead service line replacement  based on monitoring referenced in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any system may cease replacing lead service lines whenever first  draw samples collected pursuant to Sec.  141.86(b)(2) meet the lead  action level during each of two consecutive monitoring periods and the  system submits the results to the State. If first draw tap samples  collected in any such system thereafter exceeds the lead action level,  the system shall recommence replacing lead service lines pursuant to  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of  this section, a system shall report to the State the information  specified in Sec.  141.90(e).  [56 FR 26548, June 7, 1991; 57 FR 28788, June 29, 1992, as amended at 65  FR 2005, Jan. 12, 2000; 72 FR 57815, Oct. 10, 2007]</p>
