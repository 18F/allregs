                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible security for advances to all members. At the time of  origination or renewal of an advance, each Bank shall obtain from the  borrowing member or, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section,  an affiliate of the borrowing member, and thereafter maintain, a  security interest in collateral that meets the requirements of one or  more of the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mortgage loans and privately issued securities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fully  disbursed, whole first mortgage loans on improved residential real  property not more than 90 days delinquent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Privately issued mortgage-backed securities, excluding the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Securities that represent a share of only the interest payments  or only the principal payments from the underlying mortgage loans;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Securities that represent a subordinate interest in the cash  flows from the underlying mortgage loans;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Securities that represent an interest in any residual payments  from the underlying pool of mortgage loans; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Such other high-risk securities as the FHFA in its discretion  may determine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agency securities. Securities issued, insured or guaranteed by  the United States Government, or any agency thereof, including without  limitation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac,  Fannie   Mae, Ginnie Mae, or any other agency of the United States Government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mortgages or other loans, regardless of delinquency status, to  the extent that the mortgage or loan is insured or guaranteed by the  United States or any agency thereof, or otherwise is backed by the full  faith and credit of the United States, and such insurance, guarantee or  other backing is for the direct benefit of the holder of the mortgage or  loan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Securities backed by, or representing an equity interest in,  mortgages or other loans referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash or deposits. Cash or deposits in a Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other real estate-related collateral. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Other real estate- related collateral provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such collateral has a readily ascertainable value, can be  reliably discounted to account for liquidation and other risks, and can  be liquidated in due course; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Bank can perfect a security interest in such collateral.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Eligible other real estate-related collateral may include, but  is not limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Privately issued mortgage-backed securities not otherwise  eligible under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Second mortgage loans, including home equity loans;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Commercial real estate loans; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Mortgage loan participations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Securities representing equity interests in eligible advances  collateral. Any security the ownership of which represents an undivided  equity interest in underlying assets, all of which qualify either as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Eligible collateral under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cash equivalents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional collateral eligible as security for advances to CFI  members or their affiliates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Subject to the requirements  set forth in part 1272 of this chapter, a Bank is authorized to accept  from CFI members or their affiliates as security for advances small  business loans, small farm loans, small agri-business loans, or  community development loans, in each case fully secured by collateral  other than real estate, or securities representing a whole interest in  such secured loans, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such collateral has a readily ascertainable value, can be  reliably discounted to account for liquidation and other risks, and can  be liquidated in due course; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Bank can perfect a security interest in such collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in CFI status. If a Bank determines, as of April 1 of  each year, that a member that has previously qualified as a CFI no  longer qualifies as a CFI, and the member has total advances outstanding  that exceed the amount that can be fully secured by collateral under  paragraph (a) of this section, the Bank may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Permit the advances of such member to run to their stated  maturities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section shall be fully  secured by collateral set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bank restrictions on eligible advances collateral. A Bank at its  discretion may further restrict the types of eligible collateral  acceptable to the Bank as security for an advance, based upon the  creditworthiness or operations of the borrower, the quality of the  collateral, or other reasonable criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional advances collateral. The provisions of paragraph (a)  of this section shall not affect the ability of any Bank to take such  steps as it deems necessary to protect its secured position on  outstanding advances, including requiring additional collateral, whether  or not such additional collateral conforms to the requirements for  eligible collateral in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or section  10 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bank stock as collateral. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to section 10(c) of the  Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(c)), a Bank shall have a lien upon, and shall  hold, the stock of a member in the Bank as further collateral security  for all indebtedness of the member to the Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written security agreement used by the Bank shall provide  that the borrowing member's Bank stock is assigned as additional  security by the member to the Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The security interest of the Bank in such member's Bank stock  shall be entitled to the priority provided for in section 10(e) of the  Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(e)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advances collateral security requiring formal approval. No home  mortgage loan otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral for an  advance by a Bank under this section shall be accepted as collateral for  an advance if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the  Bank or of the borrowing member is personally liable thereon, unless the  board of directors of the Bank has specifically approved such acceptance  by formal resolution, and the FHFA has endorsed such resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pledge of advances collateral by affiliates. Assets held by an  affiliate of a member that are eligible as collateral under paragraphs  (a) or (b) of this section may be used to secure advances to that member  only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The collateral is pledged to secure either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The member's obligation to repay advances; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A surety or other agreement under which the affiliate has  assumed, along with the member, a primary obligation to repay advances  made to the member; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Bank obtains and maintains a legally enforceable security  interest pursuant to which the Bank's legal rights and privileges with  respect to the collateral are functionally equivalent in all material  respects to those that the Bank would possess if the member were to  pledge the same collateral directly, and such functional equivalence is  supported by adequate documentation.
