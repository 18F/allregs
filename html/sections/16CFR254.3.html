                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is deceptive for an Industry Member to misrepresent, directly  or indirectly, expressly or by implication, the nature, extent, or  purpose of any Approval by a State or Federal agency or Accreditation by  an accrediting agency or association. For example, an Industry Member  should not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Represent, without qualification, that its school is Accredited  unless all courses and programs of instruction have been Accredited by  an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. If  an Accredited school offers courses or programs of instruction that are  not Accredited, all advertisements or promotional materials pertaining  to those courses or programs, and making reference to the Accreditation  of the school, should clearly and conspicuously disclose that those  particular courses or programs are not Accredited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Represent that its school or program of instruction is Approved,  unless the nature, extent, and purpose of that Approval are disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Misrepresent the extent to which a student successfully  completing a course or program of instruction will be able to transfer  any credits the student earns to any other postsecondary institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is deceptive for an Industry Member to misrepresent, directly  or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that a school or program of  instruction has been Approved by a particular industry, or that  successful completion of a course or program of instruction qualifies  the student for admission to a labor union or similar organization or  for receiving a State or Federal license to perform certain functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is deceptive for an Industry Member to misrepresent, directly  or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that its courses or programs  of instruction are recommended by vocational counselors, high schools,  colleges, educational organizations, employment agencies, or members of  a particular industry, or that it has been the subject of unsolicited  testimonials or endorsements from former students. It is deceptive for  an Industry Member to use testimonials or endorsements that do not  accurately reflect current practices of the school or current conditions  or employment opportunities in the industry or occupation for which  students are being trained.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (c): The Commission's Guides Concerning Use of  Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (part 255 of this chapter)  provide further guidance in this area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is deceptive for an Industry Member to misrepresent, directly  or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that its courses or programs  of instruction fulfill a requirement that must be completed prior to  taking a licensing examination.
