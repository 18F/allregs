                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing of applications. A request for a labor certification on  behalf of any alien who is required by the Act to be a beneficiary of a  labor certification in order to obtain permanent resident status in the  United States may be filed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this  section, an employer seeking a labor certification must file under this  section and Sec. 656.17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employer seeking a labor certification for a college or  university teacher must apply for a labor certification under this  section and must also file under either Sec. 656.17 or Sec. 656.18.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employer seeking labor certification for an occupation listed  on Schedule A must apply for a labor certification under this section  and Sec. 656.15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employer seeking labor certification for a sheepherder must  apply for a labor certification under this section and must also choose  to file under either Sec. 656.16 or Sec. 656.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Representation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employers may have agents or attorneys  represent them throughout the labor certification process. If an  employer intends to be represented by an agent or attorney, the employer  must sign the statement set forth on the Application for Permanent  Employment Certification form: That the attorney or agent is  representing the employer and the employer takes full responsibility for  the accuracy of any representations made by the attorney or agent.  Whenever, under this part, any notice or other document is required to  be sent to the employer, the document will be sent to the attorney or  agent who has been authorized to represent the employer on the  Application for Permanent Employment Certification form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is contrary to the best interests of U.S. workers to have  the alien and/or agents or attorneys for either the employer or the  alien participate in interviewing or considering U.S. workers for the  job offered the alien. As the beneficiary of a labor certification  application, the alien can not represent the best interests of U.S.  workers in the job opportunity. The alien's agent and/or attorney can  not represent the alien effectively and at the same time truly be  seeking U.S. workers for the job opportunity. Therefore, the alien and/ or the alien's agent and/or attorney may not interview or consider U.S.  workers for the job offered to the alien, unless the agent and/or  attorney is the employer's representative, as described in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer's representative who interviews or considers U.S.  workers for the job offered to the alien must be the person who normally  interviews or considers, on behalf of the employer, applicants for job  opportunities such as that offered the alien, but which do not involve  labor certifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No person under suspension or disbarment from practice before  any court or before the DHS or the United States Department of Justice's  Executive Office for Immigration Review is permitted to act as an agent,  representative, or attorney for an employer and/or alien under this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attestations. The employer must certify to the conditions of  employment listed below on the Application for Permanent Employment  Certification under penalty of perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621 (2). Failure  to attest to any of the conditions listed below results in a denial of  the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The offered wage equals or exceeds the prevailing wage  determined pursuant to Sec. 656.40 and Sec. 656.41, and the wage the  employer will pay to the alien to begin work will equal or exceed the  prevailing wage that is applicable at the time the alien begins work or  from the time the alien is admitted to take up the certified employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The wage offered is not based on commissions, bonuses or other  incentives, unless the employer guarantees a prevailing wage paid on a  weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis that equals or exceeds the  prevailing wage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer has enough funds available to pay the wage or  salary offered the alien;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer will be able to place the alien on the payroll on  or before the date of the alien's proposed entrance into the United  States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The job opportunity does not involve unlawful discrimination by  race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, handicap, or  citizenship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer's job opportunity is not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vacant because the former occupant is on strike or locked out in  the course of a labor dispute involving a work stoppage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At issue in a labor dispute involving a work stoppage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The job opportunity's terms, conditions and occupational  environment are not contrary to Federal, state or local law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The job opportunity has been and is clearly open to any U.S.  worker;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity were  rejected for lawful job-related reasons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The job opportunity is for full-time, permanent employment for  an employer other than the alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In applications filed under Sec. Sec. 656.15  (Schedule A), 656.16 (Sheepherders), 656.17 (Basic Process), 656.18  (College and University Teachers), and 656.21 (Supervised Recruitment),  the employer must give notice of the filing of the Application for  Permanent Employment Certification and be able to document that notice  was provided, if requested by the Certifying Officer, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the bargaining representative(s) (if any) of the employer's  employees in the occupational classification for which certification of  the job opportunity is sought in the employer's location(s) in the area  of intended employment. Documentation may consist of a copy of the  letter and a copy of the Application for Permanent Employment  Certification form that was sent to the bargaining representative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is no such bargaining representative, by posted notice  to the employer's employees at the facility or location of the  employment.

Appropriate locations for posting notices of  the job opportunity include locations in the immediate vicinity of the  wage and hour notices required by 29 CFR 516.4 or occupational safety  and health notices required by 29 CFR 1903.2(a). In addition, the  employer must publish the notice in any and all in-house media, whether  electronic or printed, in accordance with the normal procedures used for  the recruitment of similar positions in the employer's organization. The  documentation requirement may be satisfied by providing a copy of the  posted notice and stating where it was posted, and by providing copies  of all the in-house media, whether electronic or print, that were used  to distribute notice of the application in accordance with the  procedures used for similar positions within the employer's  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a private household, notice is required under  this paragraph (d) only if the household employs one or more U.S.  workers at the time the application for labor certification is filed.  The documentation requirement may be satisfied by providing a copy of  the posted notice to the Certifying Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The notice of the filing of an Application for Permanent  Employment Certification must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the notice is being provided as a result of the filing of  an application for permanent alien labor certification for the relevant  job opportunity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State any person may provide documentary evidence bearing on  the application to the Certifying Officer of the Department of Labor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide the address of the appropriate Certifying Officer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be provided between 30 and 180 days before filing the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an application is filed under Sec. 656.17, the notice must  contain the information required for advertisements by Sec. 656.17(f),  must state the rate of pay (which must equal or exceed the prevailing  wage entered by the SWA on the prevailing wage request form), and must  contain the information required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an application is filed on behalf of a college and university  teacher selected in a competitive selection and recruitment process, as  provided by Sec. 656.18, the notice must include the information  required for advertisements by Sec. 656.18(b)(3), and must include the  information required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If an application is filed under the Schedule A procedures at  Sec. 656.15, or the procedures for sheepherders at Sec. 656.16, the  notice must contain a description of the job and rate of pay, and must  meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submission of evidence.

The Certifying Officer must consider this  information in making his or her determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person may submit to the appropriate DHS office  documentary evidence of fraud or willful misrepresentation in a Schedule  A application filed under Sec. 656.15 or a sheepherder application  filed under Sec. 656.16.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documentary evidence submitted under paragraph (e)(2) of this  section is limited to information relating to possible fraud or willful  misrepresentation. The DHS may consider this information under Sec.  656.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retention of documents.
