                            <p class="depth0">The Foundation does not have original classification authority under Executive Order 12958. In any instance where a Foundation employee develops information that appears to warrant classification because of its national security character, the material will be afforded protection and sent to the Division of Administrative Services (DAS). Upon determination that classification is warranted, DAS will submit such material to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority.
