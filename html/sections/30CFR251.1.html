The term does not include geophysical scientific research.</p><p class="depth0">Geophysical information means geophysical data that have been processed or interpreted.</p><p class="depth0">Governor means the Governor of a State or the person or entity lawfully designated to exercise the powers granted to a Governor pursuant to the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Human environment means the physical, social, and economic components, conditions, and factors which interactively determine the state, condition, and quality of living conditions, employment, and health of those affected, directly or indirectly, by activities occurring on the OCS.</p><p class="depth0">Hydrocarbon occurrence means the direct or indirect detection during drilling operations of any liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons by examination of well cuttings, cores, gas detector readings, formation fluid tests, wireline logs, or by any other means. The term does not include background gas, minor accumulations of gas, or heavy oil residues on cuttings and cores.</p><p class="depth0">Interpreted geological information means knowledge, often in the form of schematic cross sections, 3-dimensional representations, and maps, developed by determining the geological significance of geological data and analyzed and processed geologic information.</p><p class="depth0">Interpreted geophysical information means knowledge, often in the form of seismic cross sections, 3-dimensional representations, and maps, developed by determining the geological significance of geophysical data and processed geophysical information.</p><p class="depth0">Lease means an agreement which is issued under section 8 or maintained under section 6 of the Act and which authorizes exploration for, and development and production of, minerals or the area covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.</p><p class="depth0">Lessee means a person who has entered into, or is the BOEM approved assignee of, a lease with the United States to explore for, develop, and produce the leased minerals.
