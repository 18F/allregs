In assessing whether persons or parties are affiliated, the Secretaries will consider the following factors, among others: stock ownership; corporate or family groupings; franchise or joint venture agreements; debt financing; and close supplier relationships. The Secretaries may not find that control exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the potential to affect decisions concerning production, pricing, or cost. Also, no watch duty-refund recipient may own or control more than one jewelry duty-refund recipient.

If discrete watch movements are shipped free of duty into the United States, then the annual aggregate quantity by individual HTSUS movement tariff numbers would also be required along with the value of each battery if it is contained within. These data would be used to calculate the annual duty rate before each HTSUS tariff reduction, and the annual duty rate after the HTSUS tariff reduction. The amount of the difference would be creditable toward the duty refund.
