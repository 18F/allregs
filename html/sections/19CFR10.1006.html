                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a copy of a certification under Sec. 10.1004 of this subpart for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A non-commercial importation of a good; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A commercial importation for which the value of the originating goods does not exceed U.S. $2,500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. If the port director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section is part of a series of importations carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the certification requirements of Sec. 10.1004 of this subpart, the port director will notify the importer that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a copy of the certification. The importer must submit such a copy within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to timely submit a copy of the certification will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.</p>
