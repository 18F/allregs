                            <p class="depth0">The exemption applies only to an employee who is ``employed as'' an  announcer, news editor, or chief engineer under the conditions specified  in section 13(b) (9). Although the nature of the employer's business is  important in applying the exemption to a particular employee in one of  the named occupations, employment in the named occupation is an  essential prerequisite for exemption. Whether an employee is exempt  therefore depends upon an examination of his duties as well as the  nature of the employer's activities. Some employees of the employer may  be exempt and others may not.</p>
