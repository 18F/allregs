However, the test records required by Sec. 2.1075 shall be in the  English language and shall be made available to the Commission upon a  reasonable request in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2.945.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of transfer of control of the equipment, as in the  case of sale or merger of the responsible party, the new responsible  party shall bear the responsibility of continued compliance of the  equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equipment shall be retested to demonstrate continued compliance  with the applicable technical standards if any modifications or changes  that could adversely affect the emanation characteristics of the  equipment are made by the responsible party. The responsible party bears  responsibility for the continued compliance of subsequently produced  equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If any modifications or changes are made by anyone other than  the responsible party for the Declaration of Conformity, the party  making the modifications or changes, if located   within the U.S., becomes the new responsible party.
