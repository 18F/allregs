                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When reduction is effective. A benefit computed under the overall minimum based on disability (DIB O/M) is reduced (not below zero) for any month the employee is under retirement age and is entitled to worker's compensation or disability benefits under a Federal, State, or local law or plan (public disability benefit). The reduction is effective with the month the employee is

entitled to worker's compensation or a public disability benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When reduction is not made. A reduction for worker's compensation is not made if the law or plan under which the worker's compensation or public disability benefit is paid provides for the reduction of the benefit provided due to entitlement to a social security disability benefit, and so provided on February 18, 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of reduction. The reduction in the DIB O/M for worker's compensation or public disability benefit equals the difference between:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sum of the monthly DIB O/M rate, including benefits for all family members (subject to the family maximum), plus the monthly worker's compensation or public disability benefit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The higher of 80 percent of the employee's average current earnings before becoming disabled or the monthly DIB O/M rate (before reduction for worker's compensation or public disability benefit).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Average current earnings, defined. Beginning January 1, 1979, an employee's average current earnings for purposes of this section are the highest of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average monthly wage (see Sec. 225.2 of this chapter) used to compute the DIB O/M under the Social Security Act rules which were in effect before 1979; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-sixtieth of the employee's total earnings from employment or self-employment under either the Social Security or Railroad Retirement Acts (including earnings that exceed the maximum used in computing social security benefits) for the 5 consecutive years after 1950 in which the earnings were the highest; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-twelfth of the employee's total earnings from employment or self-employment under either the Social Security or Railroad Retirement Acts (including earnings that exceed the maximum used in computing social security benefits) for the year of highest earnings in the period from 5 years before through the year in which the employee became disabled. The result is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.00.</p>
