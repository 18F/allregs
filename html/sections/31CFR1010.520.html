                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial institution means any financial institution described  in 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Law enforcement agency means a Federal, State, local, or foreign  law enforcement agency with criminal investigative authority, provided  that in the case of a foreign law enforcement agency, such agency is  from a jurisdiction   that is a party to a treaty that provides, or in the determination of  FinCEN is from a jurisdiction that otherwise allows, law enforcement  agencies in the United States reciprocal access to information  comparable to that obtained under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Information requests based on credible evidence concerning  terrorist activity or money laundering--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A law  enforcement agency investigating terrorist activity or money laundering  may request that FinCEN solicit, on the investigating agency's behalf,  certain information from a financial institution or a group of financial  institutions. When submitting such a request to FinCEN, the law  enforcement agency shall provide FinCEN with a written certification, in  such form and manner as FinCEN may prescribe. At a minimum, such  certification must: State that each individual, entity, or organization  about which the law enforcement agency is seeking information is engaged  in, or is reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging  in, terrorist activity or money laundering; include enough specific  identifiers, such as date of birth, address, and social security number,  that would permit a financial institution to differentiate between  common or similar names; and identify one person at the agency who can  be contacted with any questions relating to its request. Upon receiving  the requisite certification from the requesting law enforcement agency,  FinCEN may require any financial institution to search its records to  determine whether the financial institution maintains or has maintained  accounts for, or has engaged in transactions with, any specified  individual, entity, or organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests from FinCEN. FinCEN may solicit, on its own behalf and  on behalf of appropriate components of the Department of the Treasury,  whether a financial institution or a group of financial institutions  maintains or has maintained accounts for, or has engaged in transactions  with, any specified individual, entity, or organization. Before an  information request under this section is made to a financial  institution, FinCEN or the appropriate Treasury component shall certify  in writing in the same manner as a requesting law enforcement agency  that each individual, entity or organization about which FinCEN or the  appropriate Treasury component is seeking information is engaged in, or  is reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in,  terrorist activity or money laundering. The certification also must  include enough specific identifiers, such as date of birth, address, and  social security number, that would permit a financial institution to  differentiate between common or similar names, and identify one person  at FinCEN or the appropriate Treasury component who can be contacted  with any questions relating to its request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obligations of a financial institution receiving an information  request--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Record search. Upon receiving an information request from  FinCEN under this section, a financial institution shall expeditiously  search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained  any account for, or has engaged in any transaction with, each  individual, entity, or organization named in FinCEN's request. A  financial institution may contact the law enforcement agency, FinCEN or  requesting Treasury component representative, or U.S. law enforcement  attach[eacute] in the case of a request by a foreign law enforcement  agency, which has been named in the information request provided to the  institution by FinCEN with any questions relating to the scope or terms  of the request. Except as otherwise provided in the information request,  a financial institution shall only be required to search its records  for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any current account maintained for a named suspect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any account maintained for a named suspect during the preceding  twelve months; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any transaction, as defined by Sec. 1010.505(d), conducted by  or on behalf of a named suspect, or any transmittal of funds conducted  in which a named suspect was either the transmittor or the recipient,  during the preceding six months that is required under law or regulation  to be recorded by the financial institution or is recorded and  maintained electronically by the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Report to FinCEN. If a financial institution identifies an  account or transaction identified with any individual, entity, or  organization named in a request from FinCEN, it shall report to FinCEN,  in the manner and in the time frame specified in FinCEN's request, the  following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name of such individual, entity, or organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The number of each such account, or in the case of a  transaction, the date and type of each such transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any Social Security number, taxpayer identification number,  passport number, date of birth, address, or other similar identifying  information provided by the individual, entity, or organization when  each such account was opened or each such transaction was conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Designation of contact person. Upon receiving an information  request under this section, a financial institution shall designate one  person to be the point of contact at the institution regarding the  request and to receive similar requests for information from FinCEN in  the future. When requested by FinCEN, a financial institution shall  provide FinCEN with the name, title, mailing address, e-mail address,  telephone number, and facsimile number of such person, in such manner as  FinCEN may prescribe. A financial institution that has provided FinCEN  with contact information must promptly notify FinCEN of any changes to  such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Use and security of information request. (A) A financial  institution shall not use information provided by FinCEN pursuant to  this section for any purpose other than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reporting to FinCEN as provided in this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to  engage in a transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assisting the financial institution in complying with any  requirement of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> A financial institution shall not disclose to any person,  other than FinCEN or the requesting Treasury component, the law  enforcement agency on whose behalf FinCEN is requesting information, or  U.S. law enforcement attach[eacute] in the case of a request by a  foreign law enforcement agency, which has been named in the information  request, the fact that FinCEN has requested or has obtained information  under this section, except to the extent necessary to comply with such  an information request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, a  financial institution authorized to share information under Sec.  1010.540 may share information concerning an individual, entity, or  organization named in a request from FinCEN in accordance with the  requirements of such section. However, such sharing shall not disclose  the fact that FinCEN has requested information concerning such  individual, entity, or organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that a financial  institution applies to such information procedures that the institution  has established to satisfy the requirements of section 501 of the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), and applicable regulations issued  thereunder, with regard to the protection of its customers' nonpublic  personal information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No other action required. Nothing in this section shall be  construed to require a financial institution to take any action, or to  decline to take any action, with respect to an account established for,  or a transaction engaged in with, an individual, entity, or organization  named in a request from FinCEN, or to decline to establish an account  for, or to engage in a transaction with, any such individual, entity, or  organization. Except as otherwise provided in an information request  under this section, such a request shall not require a financial  institution to report on future account opening activity or transactions  or to treat a suspect list received under this section as a government  list for purposes of section 326 of Public Law 107-56.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relation to the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act. The information that a financial   institution is required to report pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of  this section is information required to be reported in accordance with a  Federal statute or rule promulgated thereunder, for purposes of  subsection 3413(d) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C.  3413(d)) and subsection 502(e)(8) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15  U.S.C. 6802(e)(8)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No effect on law enforcement or regulatory investigations.  Nothing in this subpart affects the authority of a Federal, State, or  local law enforcement agency or officer, or FinCEN or another component  of the Department of the Treasury, to obtain information directly from a  financial institution.
