                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Statements on labels. Bottles containing distilled spirits, or  any labels on such bottles, or any individual covering, carton, or other  container of such bottles used for sale at retail, or any written,  printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying such bottles to the  consumer shall not contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or  that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or  inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical  matter, tends to create a misleading impression.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation which is  obscene or indecent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating  to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the  appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating  to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB  officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back  guarantees are not prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual  of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is  a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any  graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual  or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely to  falsely lead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed,  made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in  accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization:  Provided, That this paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of  any person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier, blender, or  other producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or  warehouseman, of distilled spirits, nor to the use by any person of a  trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public  prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such  trade or brand name was used by him or his predecessors in interest  prior to August 29, 1935.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Miscellaneous. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Labels shall not be of such design as to  resemble or simulate a stamp of the U.S. Government   or any State or foreign government. Labels, other than stamps authorized  or required by this or any other government, shall not state or indicate  that the distilled spirits are distilled, blended, made, bottled, or  sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State, Federal, or  foreign authorization, law, or regulations, unless such statement is  required or specifically authorized by Federal, State, municipal, or  foreign law or regulations. The statements authorized by this part to  appear on labels for domestic distilled spirits are ``Distilled  (produced, barreled, warehoused, blended, or bottled, or any combination  thereof, as the case may be) under United States (U.S.) Government  supervision'', or in the case of distilled spirits labeled as bottled in  bond, ``Bottled in bond under United States (U.S.) Government  supervision''. If the municipal, State, or Federal Government permit  number is stated on a label, it shall not be accompanied by any  additional statement relating thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If imported distilled spirits are covered by a certificate of  origin or of age issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate  foreign government, the label, except where prohibited by the foreign  government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of such  certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional statement  relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or certification  shall, in the case of Cognac, be substantially in the following form:  ``This product accompanied at the time of importation by an `Acquit  Regional Jaune d'Or' issued by the French Government, indicating that  this grape brandy was distilled in the Cognac Region of France''; and in  the case of other distilled spirits, substantially in the following  form: ``This product accompanied at time of importation by a certificate  issued by the ---- government (name of government) indicating that the  product is ---- (class and type as required to be stated on the label),  and (if label claims age) that none of the distilled spirits are of an  age less than stated on this label.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in  bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be  used on any label or as part of the brand name of domestic distilled  spirits unless the distilled spirits are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Composed of the same kind of spirits produced from the same  class of materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Produced in the same distilling season by the same distiller at  the same distillery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stored for at least four years in wooden containers wherein  the spirits have been in contact with the wood surface except for gin  and vodka which must be stored for at least four years in wooden  containers coated or lined with paraffin or other substance which will  preclude contact of the spirits with the wood surface;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unaltered from their original condition or character by the  addition or subtraction of any substance other than by filtration, chill  proofing, or other physical treatments (which do not involve the  addition of any substance which will remain incorporated in the finished  product or result in a change in class or type);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Reduced in proof by the addition of pure water only to 100  degrees of proof; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Bottles at 100 degrees of proof.  In addition to the requirements of Sec. 5.36(a) (1) or (2), the label  shall bear the real name of the distillery or the trade name under which  the distillery produced and warehoused the spirits, and the plant (or  registered distillery) number in which produced; and the plant number in  which bottled. The label may also bear the name or trade name of the  bottler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The words ``bond'', ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in  bond'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, shall not be  used on any label or as part of the brand name of imported distilled  spirits unless the distilled spirits meet in all respects the  requirements applicable to distilled spirits bottled for domestic  consumption, so labeled, and unless the laws and regulations of the  country in which such distilled spirits are produced authorize the  bottling of distilled spirits in bond and require or specifically  authorize such distilled spirits to be so labeled. All spirits labeled  as ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'',   or ``aged in bond'' pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall  bear in direct conjunction with such statement and in script, type, or  printing substantially as conspicuous as that used on such statement,  the name of the country under whose laws and regulations such distilled  spirits were so bottled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The word ``pure'' shall not be stated upon labels unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of  the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about that  ingredient; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer for  whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled  the distilled spirits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Distilled spirits shall not be labeled as ``double distilled''  or ''triple distilled'' or any similar term unless it is a truthful  statement of fact; except that ``double distilled'' or ``triple  distilled'' shall not be permitted on labels of distilled spirits  produced by the redistillation method when a second or third  distillation step is a necessary distillation process for the production  of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Labels shall not contain any statement, design, device, or  pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates  to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of  the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia,  or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any  label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation  of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia,  likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been  endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision  of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government,  organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of  arms, crest, or insignia is associated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Health-related statements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions. When used in this  paragraph (b)(8), terms are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Health-related statement means any statement related to health  (other than the warning statement required by Sec. 16.21 of this  chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature  that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the  consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within  the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The  term includes both specific health claims and general references to  alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the  consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within  the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements.  The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical  or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits,  as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements  of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate,  protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the  product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement  that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the  distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled  spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific  health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of  communication that suggest, within the context in which they are  presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits,  alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a  disease or health-related condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Health-related directional statement is a type of health-related  statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other  source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled  spirits or alcohol consumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for labeling--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Health-related statements. In general,  labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in  any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the  effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such  statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the  health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement  to   dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Specific health claims. (1) TTB will consult with the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health  claim on a distilled spirits label. If FDA determines that the use of  such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the  requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not  approve the use of that specific health claim on a distilled spirits  label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a  distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately  substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed  and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the  claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with  both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines  the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption  may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the  specific health claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Health-related directional statements. A statement that directs  consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the  effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is  presumed misleading unless it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to  a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the  effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Includes as part of the health-related directional statement  the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to  drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Includes as part of the health-related directional statement  some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds  is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the  health-related directional statement.
