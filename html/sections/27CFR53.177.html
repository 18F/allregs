However, under the circumstances described in section 6416(c) of the Code and Sec. 53.184, the overpayments under chapter 32 may be refunded to an exporter or shipper. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and 53.179. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and Sec. 53.185.</p>
