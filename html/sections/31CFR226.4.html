                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In qualifying Insurance Organizations, the Treasury will use a ratio (equity (net worth) of the insurance organization divided by insured accounts or deposits) to determine if the security is adequate. The ratio will be computed as determined by the Treasury, and is required to equal 0.0045 or greater for an Insurance Organization to be recognized (i.e., net worth is required to equal 0.45 of 1 percent of insured accounts or deposits).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury, any of the Insurance Organization's assets which cannot be liquidated promptly or are subject to restriction, encumbrance, or discredit, all or part of the value of such assets may be deducted from equity in making the computation. The Secretary of the Treasury may value the assets and liabilities in his discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An Insurance Organization's unqualified borrowing authority from its sponsoring State will be added to its equity in making the computation because such authority is equivalent to additional capitalization. An Insurance Organization's commercial borrowing authority and its reinsurance will be disregarded in making the computation, because these are not adequate substitutes for undercapitalization.</p><p class="depth2">Note: For a delegation of authority to perform the functions described in Sec. Sec. 226.3 and

226.4, see 44 FR 19406 of the Federal Register of April 3, 1979.
