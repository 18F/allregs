                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section addresses the stockholder approval of incentive stock  option plans required by section 422(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.  (Section 422 was added to the Code as section 422A by section 251 of the  Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, and was redesignated as section 422  by section 11801 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.) The  approval of stockholders must comply with all applicable provisions of  the corporate charter, bylaws, and applicable State law prescribing the  method and degree of stockholder approval required for the issuance of  corporate stock or options. If the applicable State law does not  prescribe a method and degree of stockholder approval in such cases an  incentive stock option plan must be approved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By a majority of the votes cast at a duly held stockholders'  meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding  voting stock is, either in person or by proxy, present and voting on the  plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By a method and in a degree that would be treated as adequate  under applicable State law in the case of an action requiring  stockholder approval (i.e., an action on which stockholders would be  entitled to vote if the action were taken at a duly held stockholders'  meeting).  [T.D. 8374, 56 FR 61160, Dec. 2, 1991. Redesignated by T.D. 9144, 69 FR  46415, Aug. 3, 2004]    Sec. 1.422-4  $100,000 limitation for incentive stock options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $100,000 per year limitation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An option that  otherwise qualifies as an incentive stock option nevertheless fails to  be an incentive stock option to the extent that the $100,000 limitation  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $100,000 per year limitation. To the extent that the aggregate  fair market value of stock with respect to which an incentive stock  option (determined without regard to this section) is exercisable for  the first time by any individual during any calendar year (under all  plans of the employer corporation and related corporations) exceeds  $100,000, such option is treated as a nonstatutory option. See Sec.  1.83-7 for rules applicable to nonstatutory options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application. To determine whether the limitation described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section has been exceeded, the following rules  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An option that does not meet the requirements of Sec. 1.422-2  when granted (including an option which, when granted, contains terms  providing that it will not be treated as an incentive stock option) is  disregarded. See Sec. 1.422-2(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fair market value of stock is determined as of the date of  grant of the option for such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this  section, options are taken into account in the order in which they are  granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, an acceleration provision  includes, for example, a provision that accelerates the exercisability  of an option on a change in ownership or control or a provision that  conditions exercisability on the attainment of a performance goal. See  paragraph (d), Example 4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An option (or portion thereof) is disregarded if, prior to  the calendar year during which it would otherwise have become  exercisable for the first time, the option (or portion thereof) is  modified and thereafter ceases to be an incentive stock option described  in Sec. 1.422-2, is canceled, or is transferred in violation of Sec.  1.421-1(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an option (or portion thereof) is modified, canceled, or  transferred at any other time, such option (or portion thereof) is  treated as outstanding according to its original terms until the end of  the calendar year during which it would otherwise have become  exercisable for the first time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A disqualifying disposition has no effect on the determination  of whether an option exceeds the $100,000 limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Bifurcation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Options. The application of the rules described  in paragraph (b) of this section may result in an option being treated,  in part, as an incentive stock option and, in part, as a nonstatutory  option. See Sec. 1.83-7 for the treatment of nonstatutory options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock. A corporation may issue a separate certificate for  incentive option stock or designate such stock as incentive stock option  stock in the corporation's transfer records or plan records. In such a  case, the issuance of separate certificates or designation in the  corporation's transfer records or plan records is not a modification  under Sec. 1.424-1(e). In the absence of such an issuance or  designation, shares are treated as first purchased under an incentive  stock option to the extent of the $100,000 limitation, and the excess  shares are treated as purchased under a nonstatutory option. See Sec.  1.83-7 for the treatment of nonstatutory options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this section. In each of the following examples E is an employee of X  Corporation. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. General rule. Effective January 1, 2004, X Corporation  adopts a plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to its  employees. On January 1, 2004, and each succeeding January 1 through  January 1, 2013, E is granted immediately exercisable options for X  Corporation stock with a fair market value of $100,000 determined on the  date of grant. The options qualify as incentive stock options  (determined without regard to this section). On January 1, 2014, E  exercises all of the options. Because the $100,000 limitation has not  been exceeded during any calendar year, all of the options are treated  as incentive stock options.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Order of grant. X Corporation is a parent corporation of  Y Corporation, which is a parent corporation of Z Corporation. Each  corporation has adopted its own separate plan, under which an employee  of any member of the corporate group may be granted options for stock of  any member of the group. On January 1, 2004, X Corporation grants E an  incentive stock option (determined without regard to this section) for  stock of Y Corporation with a fair market value of $100,000 on the date  of grant. On December 31, 2004, Y Corporation grants E an incentive  stock option (determined without regard to this section) for stock of Z  Corporation with a fair market value of $75,000 as of the date of grant.  Both of the options are immediately exercisable. For purposes of this  section, options are taken into account in the order in which granted  using the fair market value of stock as of the date on the option is  granted. During calendar year 2004, the aggregate fair market value of  stock with respect to which E's options are exercisable for the first  time exceeds $100,000. Therefore, the option for Y Corporation stock is  treated as an incentive stock option, and the option for Z Corporation  stock is treated as a nonstatutory option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 2004, X Corporation grants  E three incentive stock options (determined without regard to this  section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair market value of  $150,000 on the date of grant. The dates of grant, the fair market value  of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with respect to which  the options are exercisable, and the years in which the options are  first exercisable (without regard to acceleration provisions) are as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair market</p><p class="depth0">Date of grant     value of      First</p><p class="depth0">stock     exercisable ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Option 1.....................  April 1, 2004..      $60,000         2004 Option 2.....................  May 1, 2004....       50,000         2006 Option 3.....................  June 1, 2004...       40,000         2004 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In July of 2004, a change in control of X Corporation occurs,  and, under the terms of its option plan, all outstanding options become  immediately exercisable. Under the rules of this section, Option 1 is  treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety; Option 2 exceeds  the $100,000 aggregate fair market value limitation for calendar year  2004 by $10,000 (Option 1's $60,000 + Option 2's $50,000 = $110,000) and  is, therefore, bifurcated into an incentive stock option for stock with  a fair market value of $40,000 as of the date of grant and a  nonstatutory option for stock with a fair market value of $10,000 as of  the date of grant. Option 3 is treated as a nonstatutory option in its  entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  2004, X Corporation grants E three incentive stock options (determined  without regard to this section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair  market value of $120,000 on the date of grant. The dates of grant, the  fair market value of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with  respect to which the options are exercisable, and the years in which the  options are first exercisable (without regard to acceleration  provisions) are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair market</p><p class="depth0">Date of grant     value of      First</p><p class="depth0">stock     exercisable ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Option 1.....................  April 1, 2004..      $60,000         2005 Option 2.....................  May 1, 2004....       40,000         2006 Option 3.....................  June 1, 2004...       20,000         2005 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On June 1, 2005, E exercises Option 3. At the time of exercise  of Option 3, the fair market value of X stock (at the time of grant)  with respect to which options held by E are first exercisable in 2005  does not exceed $100,000. On September 1, 2005, a change of control of X  Corporation occurs, and, under the terms of its option plan, Option 2  becomes immediately exercisable. Under the rules of this section,  because E's exercise of Option 3 occurs before the change of control and  the effects of an acceleration provision are not taken into account  until it is triggered, Option 3 is treated as an incentive stock option  in its entirety. Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option in its  entirety. Option 2 is bifurcated into an incentive stock option for  stock with a fair market value of $20,000 on the date of grant and a  nonstatutory option for stock with a fair market value of $20,000 on the  date of grant because it exceeds the $100,000 limitation for 2003 by  $20,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 3 for $20,000 + Option 2 for  $40,000 = $120,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 4,  except that the change of control occurs on May 1, 2005. Because options  are taken into account in the order in which they are granted, Option 1  and Option 2 are treated as incentive stock options in their entirety.  Because the exercise of Option 3 (on June 1, 2005) takes place after the  acceleration provision is triggered, Option 3 is treated as a  nonstatutory option in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 2004, X Corporation grants  E three incentive stock options (determined without regard to this  section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair market value of  $140,000 as of the date of grant. The dates of grant, the fair market  value of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with respect to  which the options are exercisable, and the years in which the options  are first exercisable (without regard to acceleration provisions) are as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair market</p><p class="depth0">Date of grant     value of      First</p><p class="depth0">stock     exercisable ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Option 1.....................  April 1, 2004..      $60,000         2005 Option 2.....................  May 1, 2004....       40,000         2005 Option 3.....................  June 1, 2004...       40,000         2005 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 2004, Option 2 is canceled. Because Option 2 is  canceled before the calendar year during which it would have become  exercisable for the first time, it is disregarded. As a result, Option 1  and Option 3 are treated as incentive stock options in their entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (ii) of this Example 5,  except that Option 2 is canceled on January 1, 2005. Because Option 2 is  not canceled prior to the calendar year during which it would have  become exercisable for the first time (2005), it is treated as an  outstanding option for purposes of determining whether the $100,000  limitation for 2005 has been exceeded. Because options are taken into  account in the order in which granted, Option 1 is treated as an  incentive stock option in its entirety. Because Option 3 exceeds the  $100,000 limitation by $40,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 2 for  $40,000 + Option 3 for $40,000 = $140,000), it is treated as a  nonstatutory option in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 5,  except that on January 1, 2005, E exercises Option 2 and immediately  sells the stock in a disqualifying disposition. A disqualifying  disposition has no effect on the determination of whether the underlying  option is considered outstanding during the calendar year during which  it is first exercisable. Because options are taken into account in the  order in which granted, Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option  in its entirety. Because Option 3 exceeds the $100,000 limitation by  $40,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 2 for $40,000 + Option 3 for  $40,000 = $140,000), it is treated as a nonstatutory option in its  entirety.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Designation of stock. On January 1, 2004, X grants E an  immediately exercisable incentive stock option (determined without  regard to this section) to acquire X stock with a fair market value of  $150,000 on that date. Under the rules of this section, the option is  bifurcated and treated as an incentive stock option for X stock with a  fair market value of $100,000 and a nonstatutory option for X stock with  a fair market value of $50,000. In these circumstances, X may designate  the stock that is treated as stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of  an incentive stock option by issuing a separate certificate (or  certificates) for $100,000 of stock and identifying such certificates as  Incentive Stock Option Stock in its transfer records. In the absence of  such a designation (or a designation in the corporation's transfer  records or the plan records) shares with a fair market value of $100,000  are deemed purchased first under an incentive stock option, and shares  with a fair market value of $50,000 are deemed purchased under a  nonstatutory option.
